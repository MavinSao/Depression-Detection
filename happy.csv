Even now I still smile when I think I played Right Field,"Growing up I thought I was the best right fielder in my little league team. Now almost 40 plus years later I honestly can‚Äôt remember the name of the team or the name of my coach or any of my team mates . However if you would have asked me what position I played I would smile and say right field .  

Let me digress, growing up I can‚Äôt remember doing much with my father. He seemed to honestly working a lot and doing his best to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads. It is what was expected of him as a man at the time and he did it well with little to no complaints. However, for some reason I had the sense that he really wanted me to play little league baseball. I don‚Äôt know why, we never watched baseball on tv and he certainly never took us to any baseball games . Yet, when it came to me playing little league baseball he really encouraged that . And because it was so important to him I did it .  

Now I think it is only fair to point out that I was really bad at baseball. I mean for someone who really prides himself on his hand eye coordination I could never hit that little white laced ball. In fact , in all the years that I played little league baseball I can only remember hitting that ball once ! Hahha ! However despite my lack of hitting the ball my coach always had a way of telling me that I was the best right fielder on the team. He would just look at me and say ‚ÄúI really need you in right field !‚Äù And I would just take off running !  

Even then I never understood what made me such a great right fielder. I mean it seemed that all I did was yell rally cries at my fellow team mates and rub dirt or grass stains into my white uniform because the ball never really seemed to come in my direction. You see most little league kids can‚Äôt hit the ball and those who can normally can‚Äôt hit it past the base line.  

At some point in my little league carrier my dad got really involved with the team and because of such I got moved from right field to other positions. For example, I was the catcher for awhile , first base, and even pitcher for a game or two . Yet , just like my batting skills I was honestly no good at any of those positions. I mean not that it mattered, we where just a team of poor kids born on the wrong side of the tracks playing baseball on a pretty dilapidated base ball field. Even now when I think about it, it was more of a dump than an actual sports facility.  

Thus despite my excellent skills at playing right field at some point in middle school I decided to retire from little league. I just didn‚Äôt like the game and again I was seriously not good at it . I can remember telling my dad one day after a hot afternoon of practice that I wanted to quit. I didn‚Äôt know why but that really upset him. I can remember him telling me that I had to tell my coach and encouraged me to donate my baseball glove and bat because I quote ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt going to use it anymore‚Äù . At that moment I had really disappointed him. In my eleven year old mind I didn‚Äôt understand that me probably playing baseball gave his life meaning and it also probably cost him a chuck of change that our working class household honestly did have much to spare.  

The funny things is that there was lots of sports that I loved to play and I was good at. I was the best tennis player in my gym class and one of the best runners. Yet I guess my dad didn‚Äôt see that and when I quit baseball so did one of the the last parts of my relationship with my father.  

Now, fast forward twenty plus years and I am sitting with some of my college buddies and we are talking about our amateur sports experiences. It was then that I told them I was the best right fielder on my little league baseball team. Then one of my friends starts laughing at me . I was honestly a bit confused and that‚Äôs when he explained to me . In little league almost no one bats left handed and thus the ball never goes to right field . In that moment, my brain began to shift into over drive and then the lights lit up in my eyes, the ever teachers dream to see in a student, and I realized that he was right.  

Not once did I catch the ball, field the ball, or make any play that won the game. However, after years of hearing from my coach, a middle aged divorced man, that I was the best right fielder I honestly believed him. In that moment part of my childhood was crushed and since then I had never felt the same about my little league carrier. I mean I wasn‚Äôt just the worse batter on my team, I was the worse player on my team and that‚Äôs why I played ‚ÄúRight Field‚Äù.

But even now, decades later. I still smile at these thoughts and how my coach made me feel :)",0
Closing on a Condo with my Boyfriend in a few days and I am so Excited!,"I had a bit of a rough day so I want to post something to remind me of all the good I got going on in life.

We went around the table saying what we were thankful for, and when it was my turn I said that I was thankful to be celebrating thanksgiving again after so many years of it not existing. They said they were happy I was here. I just felt so much love. His parents hug me, they care about me. His siblings are so nice to me. This year I finally got to celebrate with my family.",0

My blood family sucks. I'm spending Thanksgiving with my chosen one.,"I saw a post on the CPTSD subreddit about Thanksgiving and it just reminded me of how blessed I am to have my chosen family. My blood relatives make some banger Thanksgiving food and it might be the childhood memories speaking but it's honestly better than my chosen family's food, but at my chosen family's house I can unwind, be myself, swear, smoke weed, and stuff my goddamn fat gullet. Even if their food isn't flavored with the delicious aura of the few times in my life my mom acted like a decent person to save face in front of the family, it's still better than any restaurant I've ever been to. 

I'm going to their house today with an empty stomach, getting stoned, petting some dogs, and being myself. I don't have to pretend to be Christian or normal or asked to say prayer or not allowed to swear or smoke or expected to be pleasant and agreeable with every little thing just so I can get some god tier food. 

Today rocks, and I hope it rocks for you, and I hope your family, be it blood or chosen, be it human or critter, spends the day unwinding and getting fat as fuck. If that's your idea of an ideal Thanksgiving.

I didn‚Äôt misread the signals: the barbershop meetcute that you didn‚Äôt know you needed in your day,"I developed a crush on my barber, and I assumed that their friendliness must have been part of the job. Because most of the time it is, right? I can and will simply deal with my feelings, as nine times out of ten a crush is a manifestation of your unmet emotional needs projected on to someone else anyways.

It‚Äôs just that after I left one visit I had this unmistakeable feeling where it felt like we clicked talking about all kinds of things. We were sharing facts about cool things we‚Äôve learned about, ranking our favorite space operas, discussing what makes the consistency of a soup worth eating or not. I‚Äôd actually requested a ‚Äúquiet cut‚Äù with this person and I ended up being glad they missed the note because it was genuinely a really lovely, wholesome conversation. There was a period at the end where we made a lot of eye contact, but again, I just assumed this was being friendly. I left feeling so good. Nice haircut, sure, but it‚Äôs not that often I feel like someone is that easy to talk to - I usually request a quiet cut to avoid the smalltalk I‚Äôm not into! 

My friends and I agreed that my crush was innocent enough, it‚Äôs nice to find someone that is easy to talk to, and that I was right - just assume it was generic friendliness from a person doing that as a part of performing the service I was paying for.

A few days after I got back from the cut, I realized that it was still a little bulky in places, and I knew I needed to go back for a touch up cut. I thought maybe I was unconsciously trying to find an excuse to see them again, so I asked a few people their opinions, and sure enough: wasn‚Äôt just me, I should definitely go back for another cut. I had a trip to go on so it would be a week or two, though, before I could get back to the shop.

I got back from my trip and scheduled my cut, and once I got in the chair my barber tells me a story about dealing with a crush they had on someone that wasn‚Äôt reciprocated. We end up talking about how it‚Äôs not the end of the world when someone says no, you can just be friends and friendship is not a consolation prize. They talked about how the other party seemed to think their relationship styles weren‚Äôt compatible, which led to us talking about relationship styles. Then they mentioned they can‚Äôt ever tell when someone is flirting with them, and I said that I‚Äôm the same. They mentioned they‚Äôve been more or less single for a while because they hadn‚Äôt met somebody that they clicked with for a minute. 

The cut ended and I felt like maybe.. maybe that was a hint? I was really unsure. It definitely seemed a lot more personal than any other hair dresser conversation I‚Äôd had before. It was just us in the shop until near the very end of the cut, and so just as I was thinking ‚Äúokay maybe I‚Äôm not reading into things and I should shoot my shot, big risk, but maybe if I am very respectful and offer to go somewhere else in the future if they‚Äôre uncomfortable, it will be alright‚Äù but then I couldn‚Äôt work up the nerve because as I was contemplating it, more people arrived, and I felt nervous with other people there.

So I left and went home and immediately texted a friend. 

Aaannnnnd then I texted four more. 

Because I just needed a larger sample size, than one y‚Äôknow? I really didn‚Äôt want to make someone at work uncomfortable because I misread things!

4/5: yeah in this case you probably should have gone for it!!

5th person: I‚Äôm not sure because I‚Äôm like you, I cannot tell when someone is flirting.

So my ass called the barber shop up. They were with another client and so they called me back later. And I said,

‚ÄúHi <name>, thanks for calling me back. So I am kind of an idiot also and I can‚Äôt tell when someone is flirting with me, and I really don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what your intention was, but either way, would you like to go on a date? I think you‚Äôre really hot and interesting and I loved hearing about all the things you‚Äôre interested in.‚Äù

I was not prepared AT ALL for the reaction. They squealed, and giggled. It took me a second to realize the laughter was joy because I was just not at all expecting that big of a response. Like, wow - someone felt that way about me asking them out! That‚Äôs so cool! So they said yes, and then they texted me from their personal number later and now I am scrambling anxiously to figure out some date ideas/suggestions.

Both of us are non-binary and dating while transgender is _awful_, unfortunately. I‚Äôm also autistic and am used to doubting my interpretations of social situations, but it turns out that since I‚Äôve dumped a ton of time and energy into learning how to be an excellent communicator, now I just need how to learn to trust myself more because I do get it right more often than not. So I guess, that‚Äôs one more reason to be happy :)",0

painting my toenails makes me so extremely happy,"painting nails is so therapeutic and relaxing. like nothing feels better than removing the crusty and withering old polish, washing your feet to soften the nail, applying a few drops of the the nostalgic (for some reason) pink cuticle softener, scraping down the cuticles, brushing it away, then carefully painting the colors on your toenail, sometimes adding an extra coat if the first one is too thin.

Finally had the courage to ask for her number and set up a date ü•≥,"It finally happened

To start let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm a very shy person when it comes to approaching people I don‚Äôt know. More particularly women. I‚Äôm on the shorter side. Average looking. So women almost never approach me. 

There‚Äôs this girl at work I‚Äôve been interested in for close to a year now. She‚Äôs gorgeous. Her sense of style is top notch, she‚Äôs always got some really nice outfits on and always just looks completely flawless.

Yesterday we had one of the most awkward but cute interactions ever where she had approached me. That was all I needed to say it was time. Women never approach me like that so I was on cloud 9. I went and found her a little later and told her to come holler at me before she leaves for the day.

I Don't Think Anything Makes Me Happier Than Watching Someone Try A New Food,"I'm not sure how common this is but I get insanely happy just sharing a meal with someone or even just watching someone try something new for the first time. There's something really special about that moment. 

I used to watch a lot of Bizarre Foods as well as Anthony Bourdain (RIP) when they were on TV and a quote of Andrew Zimmern's is like framed in the back of my mind. ""Food is the universal language that brings people together."" Like we all have to eat and when you take the time to share a meal together I feel like you can learn a lot about someone.

This thought was brought back to the forefront of my mind just now because of something people would probably find so silly. I was watching a Japanese Vtuber, Yukinoshita Peo, try foods eaten at American Thanksgiving for the first time. It was so simple. Just listening to her talk about it. She's over here trying to learn English and also trying to learn about another culture through its food. I honestly wish more of us had this curiosity. It's also funny because it's stuff I kind of took for granted growing up like mashed potatoes and gravy and yet here she is trying it for the first time and loving it.

I've watched other channels on YouTube that do this regularly and it's just very fun. Even when they don't like it they took the time to try it and it's still enjoyable to watch their reactions of shock.

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to live where I live because of just the sheer amount of different foods that I can find near me. I want to keep trying more new stuff because it's just so fascinating to me, how some are so different and yet also so similar to others. There's commonality that I feel like a lot of us can find in the foods we eat and I find that so cool.

As adventurous as I think I am I still think I have limits simply because some concepts are just too much for me. I think balut will always remain off the table for me lol. 

I think I'll end off my gushing here but man food is so cool lol.

i found out that she's been playing violin since she was 4 and she is in a band. also, she works as a hairdresser and, i've seen her work, she's insanely talented.

after chatting for a few days, i asked hayley out to coffee and she said yes. 

hayley shows up and she's wearing this really cute turtleneck and she's absolutely gorgeous in general. i love girls with glasses and she pulls hers off so well. 

i spent like 30 minutes picking out my outfit and i eventually went with jeans, a cream colored tee, matching sneakers, and a purple 80s style windbreaker. 

i think we looked good together. 

our first date was a continuation of our text conversations--at least in terms of vibes and energy. i learned a lot more about her family and siblings and we briefly touched on past relationships too. 

her last relationship ended in may; i didn't ask too much to respect her privacy but she mentioned that she is really looking for someone who is emotionally available. i've never really had an issue with that as i'm pretty open and vulnerable about myself so it's nice to know that i check off that box.

there were a lot of pauses in the conversation which i didn't really interpret as being awkward at all; we just did a lot of talking lol. there were there were a couple moments where i made her laugh which was pretty nice. 

we were talking about favorite movies and she mentioned ""i love diary of a wimpy kid: rodrick rules, so my taste isn't all that great"". 

i responded saying ""that's kind of offensive to me, i took a media studies class in college and wrote my final essay on that movie"". 

probably doesn't come off that funny in writing but it made her laugh super hard so mission accomplished. 

hayley also has this really cute habit of having a bunch of catchphrases that is just adorable. something she says a lot is ""don't yuck my yum"" which is just so cute lol. 

the date started to wrap up because she had band practice afterwards but we both agreed that we had a good time and we should see each other soon. i walked her to her car and we hugged goodbye.

cue sunday. 

the original plan was to meet at 5 pm at her place where we would hangout and jam together (i play guitar). 

she had a hairdressing project where she was working on 10 models (which is so freaking cool) but they ended up having to stay until 7. 

since she was so stressed all day the revised plan was to just hangout and chill. 

i show up to her place and her living room has two couches in an L shape and i sit adjacent to her. we talk more about our days, weekends, etc. i had just gotten back from a trip to visit a friend and she's been crazy busy with work. 

i don't know how but the conversation eventually moved from that to just us telling jokes to each other and trying to make each other laugh. this was absolutely amazing. we have such similar senses of humor and her laugh is so cute. 

she mentioned that her brother watches logan paul and then blurred out ""what's up logang!!"" which was so out of pocket and made me laugh so hard. this lead to us trying to out cringe each other which was so entertaining. 

she mentions that she loves jeopardy and i suggest that we watch it. i ask her if she minds if i set next to her, she doesn't, so i get up and sit next to her on the couch. 

she's locked out of her hulu account and fumbles around with it for 10 minutes and getting increasingly frustrated before i say ""tbh, i really don't care about watching jeopardy, I just wanted an excuse to sit next to you"" she smiles. 

we chat and laugh some more. she then starts showing me all of the handshadows she knows how to do and says ""i need something to fidget with all of the time lol"" 

i respond with ""if you need something to hold you could hold this"" and stick out my hand. 

we start holding hands and it's magical. her hands are so small and ugh it just is perfect. 

i forget the context for this but i had asked something and she took a while to think on it saying ""i wanna make sure my answer is correct"" 

i respond saying ""calm down, it's not like i'm interviewing you""

she replies ""in a way, you are though""

i say ""in that case, you're definitely passing; i hope i am too""

she smiles and says ""yeah, you are""

by this point the screensaver on her tv is on and she says ""i've been staring at this for 20 minutes and it hasn't hit the corner once""

i laugh and respond ""we are thinking about wildly different things right now""

she asks ""what are you thinking about?""

i reply ""...smooching ü´£""

she says ""lol, well i am never going to make the first move so...""

i respond ""right, and that's fine, well-but I just want to make sure you're comfortable y'know, anyways, well, um *sigh* --can i kiss you?""

she nods. 

we kiss and it is SOOO good. i haven't kissed that many people and it's almost always awkward at first but it was perfect with her. it wasn't awkward at all and she's such a good kisser. 

after like 2 minutes we stop and i'm just holding her with my head on her shoulder. 

she starts showing me her snapchat memories and pictures of her dog, pictures of her crying lmao, and telling stories of her with her friends and i'm just so happy to get to know her more. 

after she's done i say ""thanks for showing me that it was really interesting""

she says ""well you didn't ask lol, i just started showing you""

i respond ""well regardless, i'm glad you did. it's really nice to get to know you more""

she says ""yeah, i've never showed anyone that, my snapchat memories are for me only""

it's just so comforting to know that she feels safe enough with me to open up a bit more. she seems really reserved and i just want to get to know her more. 

at this point, it's 2:15 in the morning and i have work the next day, i say ""i really should get going but can we kiss goodbye?""

she says yes and we kiss again. after a little bit, i pull back and we stop but i give her a quick peck again and she reciprocates. we just look in each other's eyes for a bit, both smiling. 

i eventually get up to leave and we hug goodbye. 

i fall for people so quickly and i hate that about myself. i've known this girl for a few weeks and it's only been 2 dates. i'm trying to not get my hopes up bc i've been burned before and i don't want to get hurt. 

regardless, every time i think about her, i smile. 

hayley, i know you hate compliments which is SOO frustrating for me bc i love giving them. you are so, so, so, so amazing. it's so cool to me how busy you are and how much passion you have for the things you do. you're so talented and it is amazing to see. i love how much we've laughed already and it's been so fun to get to know you. i know it's still super early on but it's been so fun and i'm having a really good time with you.

#very disappointing update for everyone:

so tonight i just got back from a show that hayley played at. in attendance, she mentioned was a ""friend"" from out of town. she failed to mention that said ""friend"" was her ex boyfriend. after she was done performing she left to go outside with him without saying anything to me. 

i promptly left the venue and long story short, we had a half hour long conversation about how she's not looking for anything serious and is only dating casually and that none of this meant that much to her.

I (33M) love the unconventional relationship I have with my roommate (28f). It brings us both happiness,"I‚Äôve been single for over a decade now and in that time I‚Äôve only had very few brief hookups, no romantic connections, and very few friends. On top of the loneliness, I never finished my degree and my career has stagnated.
 
This is all starting to change now. I have a job where I can pretty much pick my own hours and focus on getting coding certifications and becoming more familiar with finance again. More importantly though is my awesome roommate.
 
My roommate and I have a rather unconventional relationship. I‚Äôve known her for two and a half years. When we first met, I was kind of hitting on her. One time she initiated things and we made it to third base, when she suddenly said ‚Äústop‚Äù. I was kind of confused as everything seemed to be going fine. She told me it was nothing I did, but she just really wasn‚Äôt in to it and was sorry. She didn‚Äôt want to do anything but she imitated things because she liked hanging out with me and thought she would just have to in order to keep guys around and that she‚Äôs aromantic and almost completely asexual. I told her that wasn‚Äôt true with me, and I‚Äôd be more than happy to hang out with her because I like her company, not because I expect her to do anything. 

We remained friends and she was always an upbeat person that would cheer me up whenever I texted her. I always knew she was weird and it was off-putting to some people, but I didn‚Äôt care at all. I‚Äôm autistic so I can sometimes be weird too. About a year ago, there was an incident she was involved in and ended up in a psych ward for a few months. We talked almost daily while she was there, and I learned more about her past. I‚Äôm not going to go in to details, but she‚Äôs been traumatized multiple times throughout her life and is dealing with some severe mental health issues because of that. 

After she got out, we decided to get a place together because she did not want to go back to living with her dad. It‚Äôs been really great. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company, cooking together, watching shows together. We‚Äôve also started a bit of an intimate relationship that some people might find weird but works great for us. This is especially true due to both our mental health issues and the fact that neither of us wants a romantic relationship right now (me because I‚Äôm focusing on work and studying).

Even though she‚Äôs mostly asexual, she still enjoys cuddling. It‚Äôs so nice to come home from a long day and being able to cuddle with her on the couch and watch YouTube or a show we‚Äôre both in to or just talk about our day/life. We also often shower together (it saves water lol), but I really like washing her and having her wash me. She sometimes even wants to have sex, but she‚Äôs told me she never wants me to initiate anything. Getting laid once every month or three is a huge improvement on before. Also, we both don‚Äôt have to worry about wearing pants so it‚Äôs comfortable being able to go anywhere in the apartment with underwear or nothing on which a lot of people can‚Äôt do with a roommate. 

We‚Äôve both clearly communicated our boundaries and what we want from this relationship and really respect each other. I‚Äôm really grateful to have this, and I think for the first time in a long time I no longer meet the DSM5 criteria for major depressive disorder. She‚Äôs really grateful to have a guy that will listen to her, respect her boundaries, and not try to pressure her in to sex like most guys she‚Äôs known have done.",0
I‚Äôve been struggling to socialized for a few months now. Slowly but surely I have come out of my shell in my local climbing gym and have been going on adventures and made a few friends :),"

I struggled so much to socialized and talk to people when my boyfriend got sent overseas, it‚Äôs been 10 months now and I finally went to a Sunday game night with some people from my climbing gym and had a total blast. Played mortal combat and other games and it was just a great time. We made our own tiny pizzas and it was overall a very warm feeling in me :) I‚Äôm glad I went. I‚Äôm also happy I‚Äôm forcing myself to get out of my comfort zone and talk to people, I‚Äôve made a lot new friends and been on cool adventures since the start of fall. I can‚Äôt wait for my boyfriend to come back so I can introduce him to them.",0

The plumber who came to work at my place is now my boyfriend.,"Yes, yes, it sounds like a plot from an adult film. At the beginning of the year, my sink started leaking, and since I live in an apartment, my landlord scheduled an appointment with a plumber to fix it. I left work early, and it happened to be the first snowstorm of the year. I got completely stuck in the snow with my car in front of my place. The plumber was already there, working on plumbing at my neighbor's. Still stuck in the snow, my neighbor came to warn me that the plumber was waiting. I was frustrated with my car situation. I went inside, opened the door, and saw this incredibly handsome guy. I was momentarily speechless. After finally managing to free my car from the snow, I went inside. I'm quite introverted and shy in life, but I awkwardly tried to make conversation. We spoke strangely, as if we knew each other. When he finished, we said goodbye, and he left. Later, he returned and rang my doorbell. I thought he had probably forgotten something, but he asked for my phone number! I was so happy; we started texting, and on our first date, everything felt so natural. I felt comfortable with him like never before. Today, we're a couple, and he lives with me. I'm dating my plumber.",0

One Year Ago Today I Was Unsure of my Future. Today I Am Right Where I Want To Be.,"

Today is my Cake Day! 365 days ago i made my account. i will always remember this day because one year ago today i was in a hospital room, unsure if i was going to make it out. i had hyperemesis gravidarum to the greatest extent possible. i couldnt eat, i couldnt sleep, i couldnt hold down water. HG is an illness that comes with some womens pregnancy. its basically morning sickness x100 and it lasts all day all night, every day and every night. for me it was worst in the beginning and got better towards the end but i did have it the entire 10mo of pregnancy. i was a sobbing mess that day. i was scared for myself and my baby. i needed a distraction. something to take me away so i could stop thinking about the smell of the hospital and the tubes and wires connected to me. i downloaded Reddit and started reading and browsing and suddenly time was passing a lot faster. today one year later i am sitting here writing this with her on my lap. she is perfect and smart and a true gift. she will be 6mo tomorrow. we made it. one year ago today i was unsure if we would. happy cake day to me.",0
I have a new job at a bakery and it makes me feel so happy and secure. My coworkers and management team have been the best!,"My new job makes me feel so positive!

After spending years working at crappy retail, cleaning, and restaurant jobs, I'm finally at a job that I'm actually happy to talk to customers and my management and team are full of pleasant people.

Like the first job I ever had that I worked for several years at was Walmart. And when I tell you that place gave me bad anxiety, depression, and stress so bad I had several seizures, I'm not kidding....
Not to mention the amount of creepsü§¢

At my new job, it's mainly ran by women. My coworkers are mainly women but we have four guys and they've been pretty sweet and awesome to work with!  
And instead of faking a smile for customers are going almost completely numb with my emotions, I actually enjoy interacting with them. I even feel more energized when I interact with them especially if they have curious kids with them. It's so adorable and wholesome.

Plus, having a job that's paying me a living wage is also a plus in my book!

I honestly see myself working here for a long while unless something crazy happens ‚ù§Ô∏èüôÇ",0

Today I worked a bit and have never had so much luck with getting only lovely callers! Long post my bad.,"Background: I work for a service that a person can request a call and vent, talk, ask for advice (not allowed but umm no people want it). We are just regular people who are there to be a listening support for people. It‚Äôs not all bad but mostly, it‚Äôs all very sad and my threshold for time worked in limited. I have BPD and struggle with healing from a very abusive, 10+year long relationship. I also have been in therapy and really working hard to do better cause I have to and feel better if I can. Last night I got two of my regular and funniest callers. Awesome! Today felt better though. I had lots of long calls today, one with someone 4 hours before I ^(broke the rules and let her reach me for free). I have done this only twice before, one of whom got himself blocked for not realizing aggressive tones and passionate ones are not at all interchangeable and I have ears that can hear him. It was sad. This made me happier. I have plenty of regulars and I try to stand apart by building friendships when given the chance. 

Now‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm discerning in giving out my number since it is a rule breaker but it does get expensive to use the service (I use it regardless, as well) But I did and I could tell over the phone that she appreciated it so she can just text random BPD or psych questions. She‚Äôs aware I‚Äôm no expert but I intimately know my BPD, some coping skills, and idk stuff I prob forget. With my own BPD, I know it well and I recognize it in others. It resonated with her a ton. Highlights:

‚ÄúI know this break up hurt me but you helped me remember that she‚Äôs hurting too‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think words mattered so much to someone with BPD‚Äù when I explained words and feelings are hard to match up. I often can‚Äôt express why stuff matters I just know it does and want to be heard and seen for sometimes having odd reactions to easy to read words that I can‚Äôt tell the intended connotation of. I got legitimately upset with my best friend of 20 years [were both old millennials] for literally the word Ok. Sound silly? It is lol

‚ÄúYou are one of the strongest most resilient people I spoke with‚Ä¶you overcame more Than I could‚Äù reminded her she is military, she did not waver.

When asked if she was interested in more philosophical discussion after mentioning some great works, explaining, and have someone pay attention enough and so willingly ask questions and for clarifications. 

‚ÄúYou have brought clarity to my confusion about feelings and I thank you for *reminding me of my humanity.* thank you for that, I needed your overflowing compassion to remember myself‚Äù

I just about melted. The way I cried! I love so much all the kind things said 

I also spoke with a guy I see as a little brother whom I also met on the app. This kid‚Ä¶he makes me smile and laugh but also calls me a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù cause ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of the dudes‚Äù and if my bold approach to flirting was doing the most, ‚Äúuh no I‚Äôd be the opposite of bothered by your direct flirting and really into the confidence it takes to do this‚Äù (which I did at my local medical weed store lol, confidence achievement unlocked). I keep advising this kid how to navigate the aftershock of a stupid choice making him unpopular for cheating. First unpopular is what children say about school, not drs in training. I‚Äôm proud of the way he handled it, and that he needs to understand managed to not lose everything over his malfeasance is huge. Overestimate of how long his peers would look at him poorly. I asked enough questions to  finally get his answer of ‚Äúthis really isn‚Äôt bad is it‚Äù no it‚Äôs not, quite lucky actually. He and I always laugh and smile with each other cause mutual appreciation and respect. He cares to much still what people think of him and I know he‚Äôll get over that when he starts believing me that literally it‚Äôs easier when you just don‚Äôt give any fucks about ultimately irrelevant people (just around his life for a short time). He appreciates me like a big sister. Until my cousins and brother had children I was ALWAYS the youngest. Being a big sister is nice :)

 Draw boundaries with respect for both. One is a doormat and the other has great but inappropriate insults. 

Tl;dr: I was told I‚Äôm wise, funny, atrong *as hell*, resilient, kind, caring, that it was a reciprocal sharing of struggles and not just one sided. I was told I am intelligent af and make philosophy actually interesting. (It‚Äôs my passion, it‚Äôs always interesting!) I brought clarity and calm to upset people and spent 7/8 hrs with the caller interested in philosophy.


This is a service I use too, and also work. If anyone wants a link I‚Äôm happy to share when asked but I don‚Äôt wanna be tacky cause idk if it would be ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù‚Ä¶.*all I‚Äôm saying is today was happy calls, feel good compliments, and the only person interested in philosophy outside of my field are studying. She was really smart and didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúeff this‚Äù at the first sign of a hard read. She wants to learn about BPD to help her ex better. These are things I don‚Äôt experience much if ever.",0

We will have a a thanksgiving this year!,"This year has been hard on us- our oven was barely holding itself together (pics) - we really tried to make it work with duck tape ‚Ä¶ but I knew it was over once it started over heating (crazy moments where I wish we had a fire extinguisher on hand ) ‚Ä¶ so 

I had made a post on NextDoor app- was hoping to keep it simple- to see where everyone bought cooked turkeys (my toddler & I don‚Äôt eat meat now- but I know it‚Äôs not thanksgiving for my husband & teen, tween- w/o turkey) - I didn‚Äôt expect so many‚Äôs responses(over 60!) and someone also had an extra stove/oven! I‚Äôm teary eyed writing this. We honestly were trying to see if we could even afford simple sides a few days ago-my husband said we had like $10 at moment. 

Tonight we have a stove (white one in pic) and also someone is delivering/bringing a turkey Tuesday - I can‚Äôt believe it. I hope I can pay them back soon- its more than we could have ask for- I wanted to just know where (in our city) to buy cooked turkey (in case we have enough next week financially)- & we got an oven & turkey üôèüèª this made our Thanksgiving & I am so grateful!",0

I just love spending time with them, sometimes being silly, sometimes having serious talks about what is important to us, what makes us happy and what makes us sad.

I truly hope that each and every one of you has people like that in your lives. I am deeply convinced that our relationships with others is what make life worth living, even if times are tough. So yeah... I just had to tell someone, and I hope that this subreddit is a place to share these kinds of thoughts.",0

I‚Äôm so excited to be moving to a whole new city away from my hometown!,"
Despite being super nervous about moving, I‚Äôm more excited about it the more I settle into the idea. 

I‚Äôm most concerned about moving away from my parents and my aunt, but I hardly see any friends of mine as it is. 

Everything‚Äôs falling into place. For a while I‚Äôve wanted to move, but I always resisted it because I had a relationship keeping me back or fear holding onto me. A little over a week ago I was afraid of paying for my bills and now I have enough money saved to uproot my entire life and move to a new city 6 hours away. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being coaxed into moving just because of financial circumstances. I let my company know I‚Äôm open to moving to two locations, and one worker wants to move back to where I am so it works out! He‚Äôs so excited to move back and can‚Äôt wait. Neither can I. 

All of my friends are telling me I need to move and that it will probably be the best thing I will have ever done for myself. I hope they are right! There are more opportunities, more things to do, people to meet, and areas to explore. I‚Äôm an artist and I keep being told that the opportunities there are so much better than where I currently live. 

The more I stay the more reasons I have to move - especially today with a couple of awkward situations that happened. 

Every now and then I get so nervous that it‚Äôs a visceral feeling, but most of the time I‚Äôve been all smiles since I found out the news. üòÅ",0

Proud of myself for drawing a social boundary,"I‚Äôm so PROUD of myself for telling my neighbor I am antisocial and want to spend time painting alone and not blabbing on!!! 

I tend to overshare and a lot of people think I‚Äôm their new best friend or that they are an exception to my rule of wanting to be alone‚Ä¶ but the truth is, I LOVE to be alone most of the time and my social battery drains pretty quickly unless I feel a strong connection with someone. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôm SO EXHAUSTED with the interaction even though I seem excited, engaged and happy to be there. (Good friends can tell when I‚Äôm not.) I‚Äôve had such a hard time most of my life telling people I don‚Äôt want to talk to them. 

I actually told my neighbor today that I am uncomfortable with some topics of conversation and situations, and that I WANT to be alone. I actually told her if I feel like talking or hanging out, I will let her know. 

I‚Äôm SO RELIEVED and happy that I did this! I was becoming so angry and annoyed to constantly have my door be knocked on and be yelled at through the door or the doorbell rung. One time she even pulled me into her apartment by my arm and disrupted my entire night. 

While she‚Äôs an alright person, I didn‚Äôt like certain aspects of this and I finally realized it‚Äôs okay for me to set my boundary and be firm about it. I even told myself if I let her know I‚Äôll reach out when I want to interact, I may actually never want to interact and that‚Äôs okay! 

I‚Äôm just so so happy that I‚Äôm going to be left alone in my home. I don‚Äôt even like waving or smiling at people passing by - unless they are a best friend or family. 

I‚Äôm very much a loner and I just generally don‚Äôt do that or don‚Äôt enjoy that. lol. My best friend told me I‚Äôm too nice and I need to learn to not act so friendly. 

This neighbor told me some troubling stuff last night that aggravated me and she was drunk, which I don‚Äôt like at all. 

I haven‚Äôt been completely comfortable being home since I met this person because I always feel like I‚Äôm being sought to hang out when I want to just hang out with my pets, paint and read. Lol.",0
Had a horrible day bc of mental health issues (psychosis) followed by wonderful day with so many things happening that melted my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è,"I deal with psychosis and had my first break a few months ago. I‚Äôm getting better but still struggling a bit. I have a good job but they made us go back into the office 3 days a week.  The lights really bother my eyes. Anyways, I got a new boss last week and yesterday I had a meeting with him and had to tell him about recent medical leave and that I really need to work from home sometimes and why. I was nervous so I gave him a heads up that it would be a serious talk. Here‚Äôs what he messaged me:

‚ÄúLet me just start by I‚Äôm truly sorry for what you‚Äôve gone through. I can‚Äôt imagine how tough that‚Äôs been. If that‚Äôs all we talk about this morning, that works for me.  I‚Äôm here for you.‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠ 

Right after that I received a text from my cousin. She said she‚Äôs coming to visit this weekend and I get to meet her new boyfriend. My cousin was in an arranged, and abusive marriage for 25 years.  It was really bad.  She would always say for years ‚ÄúI just want to be with someone who is also my friend‚Äù.  Now, after all this time, she‚Äôs dating an old friend whom she‚Äôs always adored. I am so happy for her.  üò≠üò≠üò≠ 

THEN my cousin told me that she is going to pay for me and her sister to go to India one year from now. My father was from there and moved back in 2005 and had a child in 2011 and died in 2016. I get to visit his beautiful grave.  My grandparents were Sufi Saints and have beautiful tombs built for them. This is where my Dad lies. I will also get to meet my 12 year brother for the first time. When I tried to explain why I couldn‚Äôt afford it she stopped me and said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain. You are like a sister to me. I love you so much and I‚Äôm always here for you.‚Äù üò≠üò≠üò≠

Learning Russian is helping me out of my depression,"Hi, this is going to be a messy short post but here it is

Just day in and day out I would be on my phone rotting away.

It‚Äôs been around a week now and I‚Äôm feeling better than I had for a long time. This surprised me though as I‚Äôve tried to learn different languages in the past but I get bored or frustrated within 10-20 minutes making me feel worse (high school Spanish was a nightmare) but I guess it‚Äôs all about finding a language your actually interested in. Idk if this will be just a temporary fixation/obsession of mine but only time will tell

I never thought my life could improve so much in just 8 years.,"Never expected this.

Eight years ago I tried to kill myself. It was my third attempt and I hated myself more than anything. There was no break I could give myself that was any relief. My mental, financial, spiritual, and physical health was in shambles. I was a type A and nothing worked out at all.

Today I am employed at a job I love and that actually pays well that is work from home with my two dogs and gecko. I am married to a person that I love so much and is kind and supportive and who understands house work is both our jobs. I recently gave birth to our first child who is the most beautiful amazing boy (I am very biased) ever. My husband and I own our own home and just bought a new car. To top it all off I lost 170 lbs (I had a gastric bypass before baby) that changed my life and gave me energy that I never thought was possible.

All this to say, eight years is such a short amount of time. Life is not perfect (it never is), but the lengths I have come makes my heart happy that I didn‚Äôt die. 

Meds, therapy, and cutting out toxic people got my head right. My financial stuff took much longer but is working. Anyone that is in pain, I know it‚Äôs impossible to see a minute ahead much less eight years, but to quote an old idiom, it gets better. I didn‚Äôt believe it but I have proof now. It will come slowly.",0

Today I made a joke in class and everyone laughed,"I (20M in university) made a joke in class and everyone laughed. But not just a small laugh and that's it. Everyone in the class bursted out laughing, teacher included. The joke itself was not that great, but I think the timing was so right. It was the kind of collective laughter that does not happen very often, so I wanted to share with you people.

&#x200B;

Edit: so people asked me to tell the joke. I was reluctent to say it because it's a joke about Trump but here we go.

So I'meuropean, and my teacher was talking about school in the US. He told the class that in certain school in the US, pupils used computer in class instead of writing on paper, and that it has an impact on their capacity to develop a reasonning - mind that I don't know if this is true or an exageration, but that's not relevant to the story. So the teacher said:

""See ? they stopped writing in american school, and what happens ten years later ?""

After a brief silence, I answer:

""Trump gets elected ?""

I was not expecting people to laugh this loud to my joke but I'm glad they did.",0

Very happy. My cat is back to his old self again.,Since 2013 I've had two cats. Oliver and myles. We had Oliver since 2009. We got myles in 2013. The two were basically the best of freinds and we loved both dearly. Unfortunately this year Oliver got very sick and he passed away. For about a month or two myles acted very out of the ordinary. Very sullen and he would avoid our room like the plauge. Just wouldn't go near it. I was getting worried because I was starting to think he was depressed. This past week he started coming back into the bedroom with me and my wife. He actually slept on the bed for the first time since Oliver passed. I'm very relieved and happy because we love myles. Especially my daughter. So he seems back to himself again. So pretty happy about that,0

I love this girl so much and she told me she had been working up to asking me out but I told her how I feel before she had the chance and that if I'm willing to wait she wants to take me on our first date rather than me taking her because she was already making plans. I'm so happy right now I don't know what to do. I love her and now I know she loves me, and just ahhh.

I've never been in a relationship before and I don't know how to handle these emotions, I just figured this was a safe place to write this all out.

"I want to tell you about Essie, and the last few years we spent together","In the year 2015, I moved to the ghetto. My motivation was simple: I wanted to save money, and the cost of rent in this area was significantly lower. I didn't mind the housing conditions, even if some considered them ""subpar."" The savings was worth it.

I wasn't your typical tenant, though. My landlord never knew the truth, but I had to provide proof of income equivalent to three times the monthly rent to move in. My bi-weekly paychecks actually amounted to four times the monthly rent, so I presented a bi-weekly paystub as if it were monthly. I was also a rather ordinary, white, and unremarkable individual.

From the moment I settled into this community, it was evident that I stood out from the typical residents. However, a heartwarming connection was about to take root.

One day, a kind soul named Essie brought over a Pecan pie. Essie was an elderly black woman who had lived in the neighborhood since her husband built their house in the 1950s. Unfortunately, her husband had passed away several years prior. I was profoundly grateful for Essie's gesture of kindness.

A few days later, I had an idea. Essie lived alone, and I happened to excel at making a fantastic steak. I approached Essie and said, ""Hey, I can whip up a mean steak and mashed potatoes. Would you like to come over for dinner?"" Essie was initially hesitant but eventually agreed. It was my way of repaying her for her generosity.

Essie was taken aback by the quality of the steak I prepared. I had gone to my favorite butcher to get it, ensuring it was top-notch quality, not the kind you'd find at Walmart. Essie felt uncomfortable with the meal, repeatedly saying it was too much. I reassured her that I would have eaten steak that night regardless, but it was more enjoyable to share it with someone. She finally relaxed, and we engaged in a delightful conversation.

I've always enjoyed conversing with older people because of the wisdom they offer. Towards the end of our chat, I discovered that Essie was facing severe financial struggles. Later, I learned that her monthly food budget was a meager $200, and that also had to cover her dog's needs. This realization deeply saddened me. Here was this wonderful lady who had raised her children and grandchildren, a truly virtuous woman, yet in her twilight years, she could barely afford to feed herself. Knowing Essie wouldn't accept charity due to her strong sense of pride, I had to approach this differently.

I asked Essie, ""Essie, I bet you're a fantastic cook, aren't you?"" She replied, ""One of the best; I've been cooking since I was a little girl."" With a smile, I confessed, ""I'm a terrible cook."" She chuckled, and I continued, ""That steak was about the extent of my culinary abilities."" It was then that I suggested, ""Essie, do you enjoy cooking?"" She replied, ""Of course, I love to cook. I enjoy feeding people; seeing their smiles warms my heart."" With a warm smile of my own, I said, ""Essie, I want you to cook for me, a lot.""

Essie jumped with joy and exclaimed, ""I'd love that!"" Then, she hesitated, her mind racing. ""But... I can barely feed myself,"" she murmured. I quickly assured her, ""Essie, I'll buy all the groceries you need, and if you'd like, you can even come shopping with me."" Essie objected, stating she didn't want to accept handouts. I clarified, ""It's not a handout; it's payment for you to cook for me."" Essie was open to the idea of cooking for me but strongly disliked the idea of me footing the bill.

I gently persuaded her, saying, ""Essie, your pie reminded me of my Grandma's pie, who passed away a few years ago. My Grandma was an amazing cook, and I'm sure you are too. It would be amazing if you could cook for me, and I'd be thrilled to pay for your groceries in return."" After some contemplation, Essie finally agreed, but she insisted on keeping the items I bought separate.

Essie's first meal for me was Kentucky fried steak, and it was absolutely delicious. She continued to cook for me for a little over two years, but her health began to decline. In the end, I had the privilege of preparing her last few meals. Tragically, Essie passed away in 2018. I remember the day vividly when Essie's son knocked on my door to inform me. He asked if I wanted to say goodbye to her. Essie had passed away peacefully in her sleep, and her son had gone to her house to deliver her medications. The day before, Essie had been scheduled to make chicken pasta for me, but she had not been feeling well, which was not entirely uncommon.

A few days later, Essie's children gathered at my house. They knocked on my door and handed me an invitation to her funeral, stating that Essie would have wanted me to be there. So I attended the funeral. I had never been to their church, and aside from Essie's son, I had limited interactions with her family. However, everyone knew who I was - the kind neighbor who took care of Essie, although it was essential to acknowledge that Essie had also taken care of me.

During the service, Essie's son gave a touching speech, and I couldn't hold back my tears when he said, ""My mom gave birth to a son and two daughters, and later, she adopted a second son who took care of her in her final years. Would the second son please stand up?"" I was hesitant at first, but he insisted, ""White boy, we all know it's you."" With a laugh, I stood up, waving through my tears.

Essie was undeniably an extraordinary woman, and I was profoundly grateful for the privilege of knowing her and being a part of her life. She touched my heart in a way I will always cherish.",0

Doing chores for my next door neighbor helped her with isolation and loneliness,"For the past seven years I've been supporting my next door neighbor by doing odd jobs for her.

I help her with things that are heavy, I regularly mow and edge her lawn, or change lightbulbs because she gets scared climbing on chairs or a stepstool.

Yesterday she almost made me cry when she was talking with her sister. I had just finished getting her gutters ready for winter and i 
 was working on my own. They were on her back porch and she was telling her sister how much having me as a neighbor helped her. Not just with chores, but also because both my wife and I stop and talk with her. She goes through bouts of incredible loneliness and isolation when she misses her husband still, but having neighbor who cares makes it easier.

I don‚Äôt know if my kids had more fun going trick or treating themselves or handing out the candy to other kids.

I loved hearing the exclamations of ‚ÄúDamn‚Äù, ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù, ‚ÄúLook what I got!‚Äù, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre giving out full-size bars!‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis house rocks!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOhmygosh, awesome!‚Äù.

I saw one kid give their sibling a Haribo gummy bear packet, so I made their night by giving them a 5 oz bag. They were so excited, they asked to give me a hug.

I remember how a full-size bar as a kid could be the highlight of my night. My own mother still remembers ‚Äúthat house‚Äù in her neighborhood when she was a kid & that was over 65 years ago.

I had surgery yesterday and my husband has shown me (yet again) what true love is,"Basically the title but if you want more context: 

It was a minor surgery and it didn't require impatient other than observation a few hours and then home. He cleared his schedule the whole day for my needs which is not all that wild but still. He stayed home on his one day off after a very stressful and SHITTY week to just make sure I didn't wake up and feel lonely after we came home. 

He let me order any food I wanted! We don't usually eat out and I know his favorite thing in the world is not precisely Burger King but it was what I wanted. 

He set alarms on his phone for my medication and came ready with some warm tea and a cold glass of water every time it was time to take it. 

He cleaned the house last night after a week of depression mess so I would have a cozy home to recover in.

He's taken care of all th communication I don't want to deal with regarding the surgery. He kept my mom, dad and sister updated. 

He advocated for me in the hospital when I couldn't find my voice (staff was WONDERFUL I just have severe medical anxiety and I'm terrified of doctors no matter how kind they are). 

He's held me when I've cried each and every time and has assured me that at no point am I being dramatic or too much. He just reminds me I am allowed to feel what I feel and that he's here to take care of me and he's more than happy to do it. 

I had a catheter put in for the surgery and it hurts to pee and it really upsets me. He asked me to wake him up and he would not let me be in pain alone in the bathroom like that. It was 3 am and I couldn't hold it anymore and he came with me and made sure I was okay and then came back to bed where he is right now sleeping next to me. 

So yes, even though this has been awful and a bit traumatic, I am happy because I never thought a man like him could be real and much less fall in love so deeply with me.",0

I got married and a bunch of other stuff!,"I've (F29) been wanting to tell someone but I fear that it would feel like gloating so I'll do it here! So this year has been going exceptionally well for me. I moved in with the love of my life and we got married. She is the sweetest person I know. I bought a barely used 2020 honda civic that I love. I mustered up the courage to ask the VP at my job for a new position in digital communication, so now I make fun, educational videos for customer service specialists and it's awesome. It wasn't even a department or anything. I just made this job up and its opened doors for me to work on other projects with other groups at the company. And I get to work from home! Now I'm under a great boss and I just feel so relaxed in her presence. I also just spoke to my biological family for the first time. I'm adopted and I never knew them but we all recently connected. They are all very nice people. We shared so many pictures and stories. And I am also loosing weight! I probably have an addiction to food but I am trying! I also went to see Beyonce's Renaissance tour and it was one of the most amazing concerts ever. I feel like I'm walking on clouds.",0

But WITH the HELP of Khan Academy I proved everyone wrong, I CAN do it. and YOU can too!! No one is bad at math! Just use different methods of learning it. Don't let family or friends convince you that you're bad at it!

I want to talk about how much I love a particular rice seasoning,"Nori komi!!! The japanese seasame seaweed and salt rice seasoning. It's so good!! And I've built a good friendliness with the family that runs the Asian food store I buy it from. I used to have a bad eating disorder and I never imagined being able to fully enjoy a food this much. Its funny because carbs used to cause me a lot of anxiety. I feel like I suddenly have a really easy way to eat when I otherwise find myself disinterested in food.
My fiance who introduced me to it says it's a very plain food to like, but that my passion for it make him wants some every time he seems me eat it. He said I look so happy eating it that he'd hire me to sit in front of a resturaunt as advertisement. 
It costs $7.99 at my local store for a bottle that seasons about 5-6 cups of rice imo. I have a crazy amount of food allergies so that's actually rather cheap for me, as far as meals go. It's just so nice and flavorful and easy. I get instant brown rice and I am always no more than 15 mins away from nori komi rice for breakfast, lunch, or dinnerüíï",0

Recently I found his reddit account, and my god is it perfect, just like him. A lot of people's online personas, mine included, don't really align with who they are in their daily life. But his is just like him.

He's mostly active on a bunch of threads related to the video games he enjoys, and I love having a new way to ""listen"" to him talk about them. There's nothing better in this world than listening to him ramble about games I'll never fully understand.

Honestly, I just love him so much it's hard to contain sometimes, and I am forever thankful he's mine.",0

Anyway, he had a lot of demons to deal with and I had sent an email on a really really bad day where things got worse for him. It had helped him put himself back together and he had done a lot of thinking since then. I had no idea that anytime I reached out, it would have some kind of positive impact for him, but it did. He felt pretty bad for the way he had been ignoring me all these years, but I had already forgiven him a long time ago.

Chatting with panhandlers as though they were friends gives me a sense of pride,"We've all seen panhandlers. They hold up their carboard signs, asking for money, explaining their situations. I've yet to meet someone who didn't think a panhandler was lying. But I'd rather not draw that conclusion.

Whenever I have some spare cash, I give it. If I don't have cash, I might buy them food if I'm near a restaurant. If they're lying, that's on them. But if I don't help when asked, that's on me.

Even if I don't have money (which is pretty often [more like always, tbh]) it never hurts to strike up a conversation. I love talking to people, and I like to think I might be brightening someone's day by seeing them as someone worth my time (stupid phrase, everyone is worth my time until they prove otherwise). And not necessarily some sappy ""How did you end up like this?"" No, I prefer to go the more casual route. ""Blondes, brunettes, or redheads?"" for example. See, I can build more of a fruendky conversation that isn't based on pity if I go casual.

There's this one guy I talk with often, not entirely there mentally, but the kindest soul I've ever known. He'd gladly give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. He has offered me money for making time to talk with him (I would never accept)

It fills my heart to be the person that anyone can chat with. I implore you dear reader, chat with panhandlers. Not only will you meet kind souls, you'll feel so proud of yourself for merely treating people like humans.",0

An Old Online Friend Finally Reached Out To Me,"
The most amazing thing just happened to me. For context, I (F24) have known A (M it‚Äôs been so long i forgot how old he is now) ever since I was 13. He was my first online friend and due to common interests, we became best friends. We spent our days chatting and writing stories together. Even when drama caused me to lose my laptop privileges, I found ways to reach out to him. Up until recently, he had vanished around 2017, before I graduated from high school, without a single word and I had spent the next few years trying to reach out and find him again. 

After so long, I had just about given up and accepted that maybe he had moved on with his life. Every now and then, I still sent him emails and messages wherever I could, catching him up on my life events, asking how he had been, and all that. I sent my last one back in June of this year and today, I decided to go through memory lane before going back to the old chat. It was there that I found out he had messaged me back several hours after my last post. I could hardly believe my eyes! His message bubble was right there! He had explained why he vanished from me, which I won‚Äôt go into details about, and even gave me his discord tag so we could reconnect. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt get the tag to work, but I decided to leave him another message on the chat anyway. I‚Äôm a little upset that it took me nearly 5 months to see the reply, but I am so happy that I got to hear from him again. Now it feels like it‚Äôll be much easier to look back on those memories I made with him over the years. I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôm crying so much! It‚Äôs insane! But I‚Äôm happy. Just wanted to get this out there.",0

Yesterday I faced a romantic rejection and it didn't feel personal at all :),"I always had this theory that rejection stings but that it's irrational--so I don't fulfill this guy's goal/ criteria, and then what? Should that invalidate my whole personality? Bullcrap! 

But then I never had the 'chance' to get rejected, I've always dug into safe relationships where i knew people loved me, so there was no exposition. And then I caught feelings for this guy who didn't reciprocate, and that felt horrible. So it was really a desire of mine to be able to take rejection without it destroying me/killing my self-confidence.

Yesterday I told a guy I had hopes for that I had the crush, and I said it very lightly, laughing about it; it made it less awkward than if I had been serious, and he was stunned: he stayed quiet for like 1 minute, and then said that I was a great gal and all but that he was seeing someone. And I know it's fresh and all so if he was really motivated it wouldn't have been a problem: meaning I wasn't what he was looking for in general, not just because he was dating someone else. 

It stung. Bad. Tears came to my eyes. And then I immediately thought 'Okay, it's not the end of the world. How can I enjoy the rest of the evening with him?' and asked about his relationship; he was stunned that I could actually be interested in hearing about it, but it was great to talk about such a personal topic, it made me understand him a bit better. So we had a lovely, lovely evening, and I left, very late. 

I'm so happy with myself!! It didn't hindrance my confidence and I'm not bitter at all :) It's like, tangible psychological progress :) Another thing I've survived well :D",0

I finally shared my real feelings about women with my partner and he was so accepting!,"My boyfriend knew I (f) was bisexual, but I never told him, or my ex, how I was really feeling. I was scared and thought they would leave me. 

I never got to process this part of myself, and I'm so deeply attracted to other women. I get a crush once in a while, though I'll never act on it as long as I'm with him. It's been killing me that I have such strong feelings towards other women and I felt like I couldn't talk about it.

I was really sad yesterday because my new work crush quit. We were getting along really well, and wanted to be friends. Of course, she has a partner too (f) and we'd never be together (she has no clue how I feel,) but she's so beautiful and I wish she could still be a part of my life as a friend.

I was crying while I texted my close friend about these feelings, and how I didn't know what to do about them. I felt guilty for so long, just for feeling attracted. She told me I should tell my boyfriend. It was hard, and so scary, but I worked up the courage and did it! I cried so much, but he was so accepting! 

It was even funny for a moment. He told me I ""dont have to force anything,"" when I tried to tell him that I'm still attracted to him and that my feelings about women have nothing to do with our relationship. He thought I was telling him I was lesbian!

""No honey, I like men AND women, and you are my man. I was like this before I met you, and my feelings are still the same as they were then.""

Anyway, thanks for reading this far. I feel so weightless now, and so happy I can really be myself with him. Maybe some day I will meet a woman I can't miss, but for now,  he's the love of my life, and I wouldn't trade him for the world.",0

Then in november of last year we went on a few fake dates (I always say we had 3 first dates because of this lol) where we saw her mom play in an orchestra and went on a few hikes. She saw me and my band perform at a live event and finally we found eachother and matched on tinder.

We went on our ""3rd first date"", where we both thought we were just friends going out for some drinks. She started cuddling with me outside when we went out for a smoke and we started kissing ( it was my first kiss too!) 

Fast forward to now, we are both basically nocturnal because of our school schedules being weird af, and we've been playing my favourite childhood game (black ops zombies) for a few hours now!

I finally feel like a functional adult after years of just fumbling around,"It all started the day of my birth... Well, exactly 18 years after that, to be more precise. I was thrust into adulthood with not a clue what to do, along with a terrible case of depression and anxiety as well as a total of financial responsibility. I spiralled soon after that, as I suspect anyone would. Hell, I spent not one, but TWO birthdays as a patient in a mental ward.

Depressing, I know. This story's not off to a great start, but bear with me.

After 6 years of fumbling through adulthood with no education past highschool, going from job to job, never staying too long bc my mental health just was not up to it, I decided last year to finally do something about my mental health. I underwent electroconvulsive therapy (avoid it if ya can bc it's like using a sledgehammer to kill an ant. It'll work, but it'll break shit in the process, so it's a last resort)

About 10% through my run of sessions, I started college. I'm currently a business admin student who achieves solid As and Bs in a degree program that's fairly transferrable between most industries (someone's gotta run shit, after all). Today I was offered an entry level job which has decent potential for upward mobility. Hell, I've even got assloads of free time between school and work.

I may have started adulthood way behind the curve, but now at 25 years of age, I feel like I'm finally moving forward. Sure, it may not be straight for the top, but I don't feel like I'm stuck at rock bottom anymore.",0

Never been happier because of this woman,"I wanted to take the time to put into words how someone changed my life and how lucky I am for it, and how happy she has made me.

I (at the time 30m) met the love of my life L (at the time 31f) just over a year ago here on Reddit. That's luck in of itself - anyone on Reddit could tell you that you could find any kind of person here, and for a while I definitely did that. When she spoke to me though it was different. We hit it off immediately. We spoke for hours and hours and we were totally in love with each other before we even saw each other, and then it was just a nice bonus that she happened to be drop-dead gorgeous with the kindest eyes I'd ever seen... to the point I thought her photo couldn't be real on top of being so smart and funny and she was totally catfishing me. Obviously after webcamming for months and going out to see her for the first time, she's only gotten prettier since then.

I used to get put down for my hobbies from others but she helped me appreciate quickly that it's art and it's a creative outlet. She encouraged me to do more and more of it and got me to push out of my comfort zone. Posting about it was actually one of the things that actually made her decide to reach out to me after she read through my history, and now I'm one of those lucky few who has a wife who is into Warhammer 40k and all of my other hobbies I used to get told I should hide from women. Hell, we moved the bed into a smaller room so that we could have a gaming table and display cases etc everywhere, to the point that we call that room ""the bunker"".

Speaking of other women, I once accidentally called her my ex-girlfriend's name in bed, and to this day one of her favourite memories is how much I absolutely cringed and braced myself for a the telling-off of the century... but she just shrugged, said oh yeah that's normal, it's just my brain still patterned that way, and if anything just found my reaction hilarious.

She has a lot of moments like this where previous relationships have programmed me to expect a different reaction. If she's ever wrong in an argument, she won't cry or argue or manipulate, she'll just admit that she's wrong. It's... refreshing, and honestly I ended up being the more irrational person for a while as a result, and ended up addressing a lot of my own biases and problems.

Once, when flying back home from coming to see her, she entrusted me with a feather from a dearly departed parrot. I put it inside of a book but unfortunately between the airport and home it went missing. I absolutely dreaded telling her and agonised over how to do it, but when I did she was sad but not remotely angry. She said these things happen, and I was immediately hit with how that situation would have gone down in a previous relationship (hint, there would've been a lot of screaming and blame.)

Beyond rationality though, L has an attention to detail and an insanely studious nature - she has a drive to consume knowledge, to self-improve and learn daily and I admire it. I'm not the reader that she is, but I'm trying and I'll get better with it. What has rubbed off on me is a lot of the self-improvement - I wasn't healthy and looking after myself, and now I have a pill case with a ton of vitamins I take daily, and I don't eat as much crap. She even recently bought me a (quite expensive!) treadmill, and I'll be doing time on it every day to build the habit and get super healthy.

All of this pales in comparison though to her kind nature, though. She had been stuck in a bad relationship for some time and finally got a divorce a few months into our relationship. Despite everything that had gone on with them though, when her ex needed a kidney she stepped up immediately. People said she was an idiot or that she should leave him to rot and all sorts of other horrible things, but the fact of the matter is that she did it anyway because she's the kindest person I've ever met. She believes in true charity, and charity is often self-sacrificing and the act itself is the only reward. There's not much more that you can say that for beyond giving away a part of yourself, along with all of the pain and issues that causes you. I'm immensely proud of her for doing this, and she was completely right in why - ""people don't deserve to die just because they were an asshole"". After a summer of poor health, she turned her health around with dedicated change to her exercise and nutrition and ended up donating a very healthy kidney.

When she moved into her apartment it was terrible - feces everywhere, spaghetti stains, the works. The windows were covered in paint and the skirting board had all come away. She spent over 300 hours getting it absolutely perfect to the point that it looks brand new, spending as little as possible and using the cheapest materials, and having never done anything like this before. I was seriously impressed and the place looks like an absolute palace now.

Her touch with making a place into a real home only continued here in the UK. I'm into wargaming, and at her suggestion we rearranged the house and changed things around, with the bed going in the smallest room, making it a cozy, fairy light-lit space. Meanwhile, what was the master bedroom we now call the bunker, a space to display all of my hobbying that I wouldn't have thought to do without her input and support.

Not so long ago, I got myself in financial trouble by taking a dumb loan. She told me not to and didn't agree with it, but even when I inevitably did, she stepped the hell up and paid it off by working three jobs. She got my finances back on track to the point I now have amazing credit, and with her support I was able to get promotions in my job to the point I make ¬£6000 more a year now. On top of that, she loves giving gifts, and ones such as the brand new bike and treadmill have really helped me and my fitness. I absolutely couldn't ask for a better partner.

In short, L is the hardest working person I know. She keeps going when others wouldn't, and has accomplished so much. No matter what cost it has on her physicals or mentals, she is always eager to help, and I love and admire her so much for it.",0

Sierra Domb conquered Visual Snow and helped millions across the world!," Sierra is truly an inspiration to all young women everywhere. She was diagnosed with a condition called Visual Snow when she was 22 years old but no information was known about this condition so she was not able to get any help or understand her medical condition. After years of being told by doctors they didn't know what to do, Sierra took it upon herself to raise awareness for Visual Snow by starting the Visual Snow Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to the cause. Sierra broke boundaries, by raising awareness across the board where it is recognized now in 90 different countries and counting. She also was able to get Visual Snow recognized by the Medical Community and even got an official designation from the World Health Organization. She didn't stop at awareness either. Sierra was first told that because of the slow and financially cumbersome process of research, she would not see any possible treatment in her lifetime.  
This motivated Sierra to host the world's first Visual Snow Conference where she brought together the top neurologist across the world to discuss their findings about Visual Snow. Through immense dedication and hard work, Sierra raised funds (in the millions) to be able to conduct research for Visual Snow in multiple countries and her efforts were rewarded as today, she offers several treatments for the condition that was once not even known.  
Sierra continues to raise awareness and conduct research for Visual Snow but it is truly the dedication of this young woman that was able to make all of this possible and help so many across the world. A true trailblazer. ",0

Then today, I opened the mail and saw I had received a card. When I saw it, I thought maybe my girlfriend (22F) had sent me a card. She also lives back in my home country. I excitedly opened the envelope, and it was a card that said ‚ÄúDo nut worry‚Äù, very cheesy. Then when I read the card, and I realised it was actually from my best friend and not my girlfriend. Honestly, that made me smile even more and feel kind of giddy. There was a pretty sweet text inside to encourage me for the last few days, and it is not something my buddy and me usually do, so it just took me by surprise how it sweet a a gesture it was. It is weird, but wonderful how such a simple thing can make you so happy.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my happy moment with you guys. Hope you have a wonderful day!",0

My friend and I hung out and watched Noragami together for the first time in months and thinking about it makes me very happy because I had such a good time :),"It‚Äôs been so long so I was worried it would be awkward, but nope! We were watching Noragami together.

The part of our hangout that made me the happiest was whenever Nora/Rekki would come on screen being all jealous about Hiyori and I‚Äôd just go, ‚ÄúTrifling bitch.‚Äù

My friend would try so hard not to laugh but always end up giggling seconds later after I‚Äôd say the joke, every single time. Makes me smile thinking about it now :)

This skateboard trick made me very happy!,"So much so, that right after it, I involuntarily held my hands toward my chest in this cupping shape as if to try and bottle/contain the feeling... for like a minute straight.

It might not look like much, but in my 20 years of skating and watching skate videos, I've never actually seen anyone do it. It's a rock to fakie using only the front foot. I tried this trick once or twice every few months, for the last five years or so. The physics of it don't really make sense, you don't have much of a way to leverage it back into the ramp, so I wasn't making any progress with it, and just thought it would never happen. Thankfully, while we were talking about the logistics of how it might actually work, a mate helped me reframe my approach to it enough to bring it into the realm of possibility.

This is my first post in this sub - skateboarding gives me so much happiness! I don't get to skate as much nowadays, but after this trick happened last night, I literally had to search for if r/happy was even a thing just to share this one in particular. It's not usually the cool thing to do in skating to show yourself being stoked on your own tricks (even though everyone is), but fuck what's 'cool', and fuck not freely exhibiting pure joy when you feel it! Life's too short and hard for literally finding new ways to limit or kneecap our own delight. Wishing you all great happiness today and every other day üòä‚òÄÔ∏è‚ú®

A big achievement in my weightless journey happened today - 16M,"So for the last 5 months I have been going to the gym 4 times a week and like to run 2 miles before starting weight lifting. It would usually last about 40 minutes because I am not good at running and my endurance is poor. I have always been stuck at breaking the 30 minute mark when doing my warmup. I would get so close like a 32 or a 33 minute pace.  So today I was finally able to get below 30 minutes. I got a time of 29:40 minutes for 2 miles. Which I know 2 miles in 30 minutes is probably poor for some people and I know that is easy for some. But I think what hold me back for the longest time was my weight. I am 248 pounds and running that fast at that pace for 30 minutes is difficult for me. I am so happy I was able to break the 30 minute mark because it made me realize that I can go faster and do better. I am going to try to do a stamina day tomorrow where I don‚Äôt do weight training but I just try to be more consistent with my running. 

Have a blessed day/night everyone. You are all an amazing gift of this world and we all are here for a reason. Make sure to get plenty of rest and drink plenty of water.

I‚Äôm engaged and I‚Äôve never been happier in my life!,"Had to put this out into the universe. Yesterday I proposed to my amazing girlfriend of 6 years.

I‚Äôm still so elated and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even 100% set in yet. It feels so unreal. 

I‚Äôve come such a long way. Not too long before I met her I was addicted to cocaine and had very recently tried to unalive myself.

I called her via phone and told her I have a package there and I don't know what it is. So she opened it and started gasping for air (I think she literally stopped breathing for a moment). Then she got really angry telling me she raised insane woman and that I am nuts. Then she started to insist she will pay me back because who the hell buys gifts like this out of blue and for no reason. After she calmed down a little she insisted I will give her no Christmas gift and b day gift (I already plan a trip for her b day to Italy, but she doesn't know) and still kept telling me I am nuts. After like half an hour she tried to make me promise not to do thing like that ever again and finally accepted it thanking me profoundly and telling how happy I made her. She got all emotional and asked me if I think we had a happy childhood and if she was to tough and didn't have enough patience with us. She also told me I should keep my bonuses for myself and that she doesn't want me to spend this much money for her.

I cried tears of happiness for the first time in my life.,"I‚Äôm going to start this off by saying that I‚Äôm not a big fan of publicly expressing my feelings and thoughts. Even to people I care about deeply. Before last night, I hadn‚Äôt even cried in a very long time.

Well, me and my boyfriend were on FaceTime, and he‚Äôs laying down about to fall asleep. I‚Äôm writing in a little journal of mine, and suddenly he becomes very interested in what I‚Äôm writing. I don‚Äôt want to show him what I‚Äôm writing, because it‚Äôs mainly about him. Countless words about how much I love him. Even though it was all good things, I didn‚Äôt want to show him a single word I had written.

After a while of begging me to tell him what I had written, he stops. Out of nowhere, he makes his own declaration of his love for me. About how he loves my hair, my smile, my clothes, the face I make when he makes a bad joke, how I hide my face whenever he says something sweet. He told me how beautiful I am, how funny I am, and how mean I can be sometimes. He just kept going. It set in, right then and there, that he actually loves me. A lot. 

I almost immediately break down in tears. No one, and I mean no one, has ever said anything like this for me. I don‚Äôt say anything back, roll over and silently cry for a pretty long time. He must‚Äôve caught on that I was crying, because he asked if I was okay. 

I was way more than okay. I love him so much.",0

I bought my mum fairly expensive perfume she really wants for a long time and I just cant wait for her to open it,"
I great up in loving but financially struggling home. My real father left, didn't pay any child support and my mum had to work 3 jobs to provide for us. She met my (step)dad and they are together for more then 2 decades and they are doing fine now but in my teens we really struggled. Now they are comfortable (their own home, cars paid off and savings) but unfortunately my mum still lives with the 'I can't afford it mentality'
I must point out the my mum and dad are both wonderful caring and loving people ‚ù§Ô∏è and I love to make them happy. 

I actually made my dad cried once when I brought him Ferrari t shirt from my trip to Rome (He s huge cars fan). He even kept the cardboard tag with Italian flag on it and still refuses to let my mum throw it away 4 years later. 

Well I took my mum shopping and we went to cosmetics and perfume store. We were checking some perfumes and I notices she really, really like one because she has this twinkle in her eyes and she stood there longer and even sprayed herself a little with the tester. But I knew what the problem was. The perfume was almost 300‚Ç¨ and she would never ever treat herself with something like that. 

I got some really big bonus at work this month and up for even bigger one in October and November. So when I got home I ordered the the perfume online to her work and I will let her unpack it pretending that I don't know what it is and ask her if she could open it and let me know. (They have special spot for deliveries where people come, give them code and the worker gives them the package as a side service). I know she s gonna be horrified and spent ""so much"" money on her at first but she will be finally happy. 

The package is supposed to be delivered tomorrow and I have nobody to share it with because my dad would insist he will pay me back and I don't want it. So I came to reddit to share my excitement. So please people be excited with me and wish me luck so she really is so happy as I hope she will be. :)

I ended up going the next day, he ddnt work at my cars brand anymore but he got his new place to order the transmission fluid I needed, the key fob battery, to do my alignment for free n check my tires and wash my car. The only thing I had to pay for was the transmission fluid change but even that was at a discounted rate and the rest was free!!

It was amazing, bc truly he ddnt have to do any of this at all for me and he asked of nothing in return, although I know he made a big commission off my car when he first leased it to me haha, but seriously it was like one of the nicest things anyones ever done for me :,) And not knowing a lot about cars Im always a little worried about getting scammed or something at the mechanics & dealerships, but he said when my lease ends he'll also help me out with financing it :) Im so happy!!

Not many people went, but I kept glancing at the RedCross van outside.

I finally worked up a bit of nerve for just long enough to go inside and sign up. After the most anxious few minutes of my life, they called my name, and I didn‚Äôt back out. I made it through the whole thing. It might not seem like a big deal, but to me, it meant the world.

Years of feeling unfulfilled gone in two weeks,"Hello r/happy. 

I (30m) have been struggling with feeling like I‚Äôm either too lazy or too depressed to make any important changes in my life since 2020 (excluding marrying my amazing and beautiful wife). 
 
When I was younger, I was an extreme extrovert. I played sports, went to concerts, was in clubs at school, etc. I can confidently say that I was able to strike up conversation with a stranger and leave that conversation with a new friend. I loved myself then. I thought I had purpose then. 

Somewhere down the line, I became more and more introverted. Didn‚Äôt want to hang out with friends, didn‚Äôt want to go exploring, avoiding small talk at all costs, and quite frankly, a shell of the person I once believed I was. 

In 2022, I had a sever panic attack at work, which ultimately ended with me being diagnosed with a panic disorder by my psychiatrist. Since then I‚Äôve been on a daily medication and one I use for when I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed. 

I work a typical office job (albeit high importance items), typing away my life for 10 hours a day before going home and getting high off my ass and spending the remainder of my night playing video games.

Over the last few months, the things I found enjoyable have become more of a habit rather than a hobby and it left me feeling even more unfulfilled. I‚Äôve tried exercising, photography, journaling, basically anything that could bring that person back.  Unfortunately, none of it really made me feel like the me I once was. 

About 3 weeks ago, I had another near panic attack. Thankfully, it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first but it set me back in my own mind. Made me feel as if this is just who I am now and that I have to accept it. I spoke to my wife about it, my parents, my friends, but nothing they said really helped to provide a solution. 

I felt lost once again and that I have to just accept who I am now. I boring middle aged man who deserves to suffer in his own misery. 

I got home from work that night and put on a TV show which I‚Äôm sure lots of you have heard of,  Ted Lasso. It was my first time putting it on and with no expectations I had no idea what I was going to be watching. 

I watched 6 episodes that night. I laughed, I cried, and most importantly, and as cliche as it sounds, I was inspired. It made me think about how I‚Äôve been looking at myself. It made me think about how I was treating others. It made me remember that there is so much more to work and a computer full of video games. 

The more I watched, the more I listened and tried to apply the lessons they teach in the show. The more I applied these lessons to myself, I found myself looking through an old lens. The one I had been missing for so long. 

That same day, I hesitantly reached out to my old soccer coach to ask if he is still coaching for the local high school. To be honest, my anxiety was making me scared to even make the call and I almost didn‚Äôt do it. I didn‚Äôt want to be let down if he wasnt, which ultimately would‚Äôve made me go right back to where I was before. Regardless, I sent the text. 

The following morning I get a reply text saying he‚Äôs always open for another assistant coach and to come check out practice. I was both excited and scared. Excited because I‚Äôll be back doing something I once loved. Scared because I have to now step out of my comfort zone that I haven‚Äôt stepped out of in years. Their next practice was in three days.

I show up just as all the students are arriving and once again my anxiety was trying tell me to give up. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do this you‚Äôll be bad at it. You‚Äôll only make it harder for them‚Äù

Oh how wrong that voice in my head was. 

Immediately upon walking into practice I‚Äôm greeted by nearly everyone on the team. Not only that, they were excited to meet me. They were excited to get to know someone who they have never seen in their lives. They were curious, not judgmental. Each practice after the first they had more questions about their coach, and by practice #2, they already named me ‚ÄúCoach Topo‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs now been two weeks and I can honestly say this is the happiest I have been in a long time. I‚Äôm happy because I‚Äôm connecting with people. Not just the students but their parents as well. I‚Äôm happy because this is giving me purpose again. I‚Äôm happy because I have people who are relying on me to be a mentor, or even just a friend. I‚Äôm happy, because for the first time in years I feel like a piece of me that was lost has just been found. 

I had been standing in my own way keeping myself isolated and I finally just stepped to the side and walked past that version of me. 

I wanted to share this because I was so afraid of failing or being rejected that it stopped me from finding something that I love. I wanted to share this because I know there are others like me who are feeling that way.  

I want you to know that you do have the power to change it. It‚Äôs not easy, and it‚Äôs not fun having to step out of your comfort zone, but if you try, you may find that version of you that you may have lost. 

To anyone who happens to read this post, thank you for listening. I hope nothing but for you to find that happiness and that it never leaves you again.",0

It kind of came out, I luhh you, so I was a little scared to say it back honestly lol. I kind of froze because I was surprised and he jokingly was like ""you didn't say it back!"" So then I said it back. And I mean it! It's just funny because I've loved him for way longer but have been too scared to say it first. He's kind of timid with his feelings, believes more about showing things with actions and not words. Anyways, I'm just very glad I got that confirmation tonight, I was so happy that I went inside and cried a little lol",0

Made new friend at ER who helped my anxiety tremendously!,"It was my first time being in the hospital in the U.S. and I was having a really hard time breathing (severe allergy reaction) and I was very very anxious and scared being in the unfamiliar environment. 

I waited in the ER for 13 hours before I got treated, and I had multiple anxiety attacks. Another patient that was also waiting to be treated befriended me and made sure I was okay each time. 

During my stay at the ER, I was huddled up in a corner. My friend went around the room briefly talking to everyone for a bit. I thought he was just a social butterfly and killing time, but after talking to everyone he came back to me and told me this that if I was having an anxiety attack and he wasn't there, he listed the friendly people I can go talk to. He was performing a vibe check for me!!! I'm so happy and grateful for him. 

I was discharged after 16 hours, and we exchanged contacts. He stopped responding to me, so I assume he is undergoing his jaw surgery right now. I really hope he is okay!!",0

"Fun-loving, famous-among-friends, uncompromising wife made a mistake","‚ÄúWife so nice‚Äù

My wife is so tough and able.  She excels at everything while being fun and drinking the exact perfect amount while making everyone belly laugh.

While in the army reserves as a dental assistant she knew more than everyone bc she went to college for it while they were exclusively army trained.  Then as a civilian she had an advantage again bc because of her training and diligence.  As a hygienist now for almost 15 years she runs two chairs with an assistant and sets records every month at her office and is highly valued.  People from the company come watch her to see how she operates.  Patients love her gentle hand and attention to detail.  We actually got set up 5 years ago by a patient who was a mutual friend.

She participates in a diet/exercise program called E2M (eager 2 motivate) and lost 58 lbs.  She is so fit and slim and strong and looks fantastic and helps the family meal prep.

She has‚Ä¶ not a mean streak but can be kind of ice cold.  She loves not having kids and is not compromising.  She knows I want kids.  This is not a problem we always kind of laugh at this soft spot of mine.  She believes I am not really aware of the work and that it will mess up our fun, free lives.  

Another gracious fact is that when helping for her half marathon and giving the girls shots and meeting them to take headbands and give or take shirts and give water I got kind of drunk on her birthday and was a little shaky (hammered) and instead of being angry she loved it and laughed and was very kind to me.  She said it was the best birthday present.

Anyway now she‚Äôs pregnant bc she messed up her birth control and I love love love it.  She knows exactly what to do bc so tough and able and always paid attention to her mom and siblings and friends.  Boom - prenatal vitamins, must keep working out and stay healthy, no caffeine, no processed meats, we can‚Äôt tell anyone first trimester, doctor appointments, we‚Äôre going to self sooth, Andy make sure you read to them a lot not kid books but real books, teach them about cars.  She says all the E2M girls get pregnant bc so healthy.  She fucked up and we laughhhhhh.

TLDR:  uncompromising, fun-loving, famous-among-friends wife loves not having kids and never makes mistakes messed up birth control and is now pregnant didn‚Äôt skip a beat in being ready to be a mom.  We laugh bc I wanted kids and it‚Äôs her fault.",0

I‚Äôm officially current on my rent after being behind (and playing catch up) for months!,"Before I start, I hope kindness reaches this post. I know I made so many mistakes, and this was something I worked really hard to remedy. It made me happy and also emotionally because I don‚Äôt have my mom or dad anymore and I think they‚Äôd be proud of me. Just wanted to share because I have no one else (except my twin sister who helped me.) I‚Äôll probably delete later. Thank you.

For a long while, I had been posting for help with rent and bills. I got into this mess because I‚Äôd help family members with their needs and they demanded more and I‚Äôd cave. I also wasn‚Äôt responsible enough with my finances to make sure I wasn‚Äôt too behind on anything. Hours had dropped a little at work due to the season, and I had allowed a family member to use my DoorDash account so they could feed my nieces (his got banned), which got mine banned. I made this mess and lied in it for a while.

It got to where reaching out became an unhealthy, desperate habit, and it got me banned from assistance subreddits. It sucked, but my constant posting did flag me as suspicious and I understood.

At that point, I realized that I needed to get myself together. I saved money, moved bills around to prioritize rent, pawned my iPad, worked as many hours as I could, etc. My twin sister and I wrote down a budget and stuck to it. 

When I realized I still needed at least half of the late balance before the landlord would submit for eviction, (yeah, we were behind about two and a half months), I did reach out to family as a last resort. I did apply for rental assistance to be denied in the end.

The other family I have with me has refused to help in the past, especially after they got my first car involved in an accident and didn‚Äôt accept any responsibility, so I didn‚Äôt ask them to help.  Can‚Äôt rely on them. 

The only reason they‚Äôre still with me is because of my nieces. I plan on trying to get them out of my apartment as soon as April (she‚Äôs pregnant, and he‚Äôs on probation.) As much as I love them, the living situation now isn‚Äôt good for anyone, and I feel like they are waiting on me to make their lives better. That‚Äôs a story for another day.

A family member did connect with me and offer to help me with some of the remaining balance, (will be paying her back ASAP) and as of this Friday, we are officially current (and even a bit ahead) on rent!

I‚Äôm proud of the fact that I was able to get this situation handled. Things have been hard for me. I‚Äôm still struggling to find my backbone, and to get my ADHD and Bipolar under control. I am not blameless in the situation I put myself in, at all. I am a single, child-free adult who should be doing wonders right now.

But this was a start. I have a lot more growing up to do. It just made me happy that we got it current after months of being behind.

Now, it‚Äôs to working on getting other bills paid, and getting other iPad out of the pawn shop for the final time.

Thanks for listening.",0

"Hey, I wish to share my personal experience today how my life changed completely after i found out a secret. STORY TIME","The secret is meditation. Meditation has made a big difference in my life, and I want to share how it's touched me deeply.  
I remember when I first started meditating. Life was stressful, and I was overwhelmed with work and the noisy city around me. Stress and anxiety were always there, making my health and relationships suffer. A friend suggested meditation, and though I was skeptical, I decided to give it a try.  
At first, meditating felt like a struggle. My mind was used to racing thoughts and distractions, so sitting quietly and focusing on my breath was hard. But I kept at it, knowing that change takes time.  
As I practised meditation, I noticed changes in how I handled stress. I became calmer and clearer when dealing with tough situations. Instead of getting lost in my feelings, I could step back and watch my thoughts without judging them. This helped me make better decisions and deal with problems more effectively. I started watching many youtube videos on meditation and today i found the best of them all a true gem that really has changed my perspective. if you wanna watch it here is the link [https://www.youtube.com/live/gfkvm6-Tjp4?si=I-x1Oxgtyv7bB\_Ju](https://www.youtube.com/live/gfkvm6-Tjp4?si=I-x1Oxgtyv7bB_Ju) . I hope it helps someone else like it helped me  
Meditation also had a big impact on my mental health. I had been dealing with anxiety and occasional depression for a while and relied on medication to cope. But with meditation, I started feeling more at peace and content than ever before. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and I even needed less medication, which my doctor helped me with.  
My relationships improved too. Meditation helped me become more understanding and empathetic towards others. I became a better listener and communicator, making my connections with friends and family deeper and more meaningful.  
Physically, I slept better, had more energy, and experienced fewer headaches and stress-related health issues. I felt healthier and happier overall.  
One unexpected gift was finding my purpose and direction in life. Through meditation, I gained clarity about my goals and passions, which led me to pursue things that truly mattered to me.  
Meditation hasn't magically solved all my problems, but it has been a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. It has brought me mindfulness, resilience, and inner peace, and I'm excited to see how it continues to shape my life. I'm deeply grateful for the positive impact it has had on every part of my life. Meditation isn't just a change; it's a heartfelt transformation.",0

**God**: Listen, life is too short, or too long depending on your perspective, to be unhappy. So find the joy in the little things, would ya? Because if you don't, I might just have to come down there and tickle you all myself!

**God**: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a universe to run. And by the way, it doesn't run itself‚Äîdespite what your physicists might think. Goodnight!

And so, God exits the stage, leaving the audience with a celestial chuckle and perhaps, a divine lesson on happiness.",0
I met an old coworker yesterday evening and she said something that made me so happy,"I‚Äôm not sure where else I could post this, I just wanted to share because of how happy it made me !

An old coworker of mine ! 

I approached her to say hi, and she just went : ¬´¬†Hi frenchy_turtle ! How are you ? You‚Äôre still as beautiful aren‚Äôt you ?¬†¬ª

When we got there, I sat down at one of the tables since i didn‚Äôt want to be there, and went on my phone. I would have rather been playing video games with my friends, but of course a girl sat by me. We hit it off instantly, going for a short walk around the school, and getting back to the dance. My brother had convinced all his friends to vote for me and that girl, and so we were king and queen! I was stunned, and my brother just smirked at me! I got my crown, and so did she, and we danced! We danced a bit, and ended up falling for each other! I got her number, and she got mine, and we talked a lot the rest of that year, getting really close then. We went to the same collage, and were dating then until I finally popped the question, and, 1 year later, were gonna get married now! I am super happy, and glad that I finally said yes because if it weren‚Äôt for my brother, I wouldn‚Äôt have met the love of my life! ",0

I had a really good day and I wanted to share it with y'all <3,"Hey so I have no one to freak out to so here goes... I found out that my cousin and her husband are pregnant and I'M SO EXCITED FOR THEM!!! They posted a photo with their dog in a bib that says ""Baby security on training"" and a onesie and a board with the due date. I'm moderately close with my cousin; I was at her wedding and I can't wait to have a little one running around. It's gonna be a 16-year age difference so it's probably gonna be like more of a sister relationship than an aunt one? Whatever it is, I can't wait to meet them! I keep on smiling when I imagine my cousin and her husband as parents and my aunt and uncle as grandparents. Technically, the baby would be on the same *generation level* as me... which is weird if you think about it... yeah whatever...

Also, I finished Modern Family today. I dedicated the last month of my life to that show, watching it whenever I had free time from school and stuff, and it really was an amazing show. The finale was amazing and I'm happy about that too!

TLDR: My cousin's expecting. I'm super excited!!! Also, I finished Modern Family and loved it!!!! <3",0

She called me Dad (sort of) and I can't stop smiling,"She called me Dad, sort of.

My daughter's best friend (we'll call her Beth) and her younger siblings moved in with us after Beth's mom passed away from COVID 2 years ago.
We adopted Beth in March as an adult (still working on adopting the siblings, it's not as easy for minors). Beth had already been adopted before, and she has never had a good father figure in her life, so the word ""Dad"" does not have positive connotations for her.  She has also always called me Mr. DataNinja (Mr. my-first-name) since she was 5.  We've had many conversations about it and I told her she can call me whatever she wants, because I know she loves me. I tried to get her to drop the ""Mr."" once, since she is in her 20's now and it almost broke her brain.

Yesterday, we made a late night run to McD's and she was rocking the aux in the car from her phone and was playing some Demi Lovato.  All of sudden, she turns it off and says ""You're my Dad, I can't play that!""
I've been just randomly smiling for the last 2 days because I think about what she said.

I know she will likely never call me ""Dad"" directly and I'm happy with that. She has even introduced me to her friends and co-workers as her dad, but there was something about her saying it when it was just the two of us that made my heart sing.

Like many indie musicians, most of the people who listen to my music are people I've reached out to directly: friends, family, that sort of thing.  I love that they enjoy my music, but there's always that lingering doubt that if they didn't know me personally they might not listen.  That changed last night.

I met someone who heard about my music from an artist I know.  Turns out they looked up my band on Spotify and absolutely loved what they heard.  I got to hear this from them in person, out of the blue, and it absolutely made my day.  

and yes, this *did* actually happen - this isn't just music promo, I'm terrible at music promo stuff :)   my band is The Three Leonards, in case anyone's curious.

Today while working on some work he was singing a song, he does this a lot on call when he's doing his work, it's relaxing. When he was done though he asked me ""I'm surprised you didn't realize what song that was.""  
He was kind of glitchy so I was catching every second word or so, but I still took a guess and he just said no and replayed the song and I realized he was singing ""If you ever leave I'm coming with you"" by the Wombats.  
I made a comment, joking, a few days ago that he should learn the song since it was one of my favorites and before he was pulling me up to dance when I was showing him the song. I said it'd be fun if we could sing it together again, this time though he'd know all the words too. I didn't expect him to take it so seriously cause after he told me the song, I was touched. But then he proceeded to say ""Yeah I've been making sure to play this song at least once every morning or put it on repeat so I can learn the lyrics like you asked.""  
Honestly didn't expect him to learn the lyrics, taking time out of his mornings to learn a silly song I loved for me. I mean I didn't expect him to brush over it, but didn't expect him to take it so seriously lol. If that even makes sense.

After a very complicated pregnancy my wife gave birth to our first child :),"We found out she was pregnant first week of January and the following 9 months has been chaos every turn but he finally arrived perfectly healthy :)

She went from bed rest, to him wanting to come out at 20 weeks so she got an emergency cerclage, then she was okay for a couple months then when they took out the ‚Äústitch‚Äù part of it got stuck which caused more issues. 

Fast forward to induction date and she was having contractions of a 5 cm women but she wasn‚Äôt dilated at all. At 8am they decided to put a ballon in her and the nurse checked at 9am and she was at 1 cm then nurse came back at 10am and said ‚Äúoh the ballon is out that means you are at 5cm‚Äù then did a double take and said ‚Äúoh I need to call your doctor it‚Äôs baby time!‚Äù And within 14 mins and only 3 pushes our little dude was here completely healthy.

i met one good customer today that honestly made a bad day better,"i work retail, and there's also a section where we do party stuff, which includes blowing up balloons. i do not enjoy balloons. they're loud and unpredictable and i just hate it.

anyways, this lady came up directly to me and gruffly asked to me to blow one up. so i said sure and walked down there, she followed.

i was asking if she wanted a weight for it and she snapped at something, but wasn't looking at me, so i kinda did a ""wtf""/ready to run stance, she looked at me and laughed. she said ""sorry i was just wondering why you have this sports team and not this one (on baseball caps and jerseys). im not complaining though! you probably don't care.""

i just said, ""haha yeah im not sure. to be honest i don't deal with anything in this department, i just know balloons.""

then she asked how long id been workinh there (almost a year) and if it was good (eh, good days and bad days. the people are good though.)

then we talked about her day, and this all took a few minutes because she only had one balloon and it was one of the easy ones. 

then i was waiting to complete the order, which can only be done after the customer has paid for it. so im standing there, and the cashier calls my name over the employee radios, which is weird cause they usually call for department rather than an individual. so i asked ""was that for me?"" in case i heard wrong. she said ""sure was,"" i said ""yeah what's up?"" 

and she said ""the customer with the balloon said you were amazing.""

i didn't know how else to reply so i just picked uo my radio and said ""awww"" because i was honestly trying not to cry. 

then i got home a few hours later and *did* cry lmao. 

sometimes, on the rarest occasions, i love my job.",0

"It's my little boy's third birthday, and the first one that doesn't even feel like a trauma anniversary","My youngest of three was born with gastroschisis (intestines on the outside). Perforation (very high fatality risk) was imminent at 32 weeks, so they had to pluck him, which was horrifying, as degree of prematurity is the most impactful factor in the mortality rate of gastroschisis. At one point as I waited in antepartum, I was visited by social workers bearing advice and resources for memorials and trauma counseling, ""just in case"".  

 Thank god, he was born over a pound bigger than ultrasound indicated, and got a seven apgar! But it was still a long a difficult road, spending 96 days in the NICU with two surgeries in 2020, with two of those months involving an ostomy bag and a feeding tube. Very little support was even legal at this time, but my family did everything they could. Unwilling to get my hopes up too high, my only wish was for him to come home in time for Christmas, which at the outset was treated as a very humble goal. Then we experienced multiple setbacks and even started preparing for a third surgery, which would extend his stay at least another month, and I was crushed. But his absolutely majestic pediatric surgeon stubbornly pushed ahead, and his stricture healed itself. He came home on December 16th, 2020 and was there to open his presents on Christmas Day =)

 The stress of that entire year took a toll on me, though, especially since his early months at home were rocky and carried the ever-present threat of a return to the NICU, and to the OR. His first birthday felt a lot like a trauma anniversary. I couldn't help being flooded with those same heavy, panicky feelings. His second birthday was a bit better. 

 Today just feels like a birthday. He never did return to the hospital, other than for regularly scheduled followups with his specialists. He no longer experiences any particular pain, and has completely caught up on all his milestones. His biggest problem in life is that he has to share toys with his sisters, but there was a time that he was three months old and hadn't even met them.

 I'm so grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è",0

My parents told me happy birthday for the first time in a decade.,"My family is very toxic because of drugs and they got so bad off that they would forget my birthday. No cards or calls for ten years until the 7th. I went NC with my family and let myself heal from the trauma and learning to forgive them. 

My mom recently had a series of strokes that led to a massive stroke and she survived when the doctor said she would pass. But she made it. She couldn't talk very well but dad helped her practice saying ""happy birthday."" Hearing those words from her when I thought I'd never hear her say anything again just makes me so happy. 

She may be a little simpler minded now but she is alive and that's all that matters. She gets so happy and giggles and gets really excited to hear from me. She doesn't insult me anymore just tells me how much she loves me. She's not the same person that was unkind to me. I want a relationship with this new version of my mother and I hope it goes well.

My dad he was abusive and after I left and moved over 1000 miles away he changed. I don't know what changed but I have never heard my dad be sincere before. He didn't break the cycle but I did and he's proud of me. He has a lot of guilt and regret for what he did to me.

Since my moms stroke my parents are just different when they speak to me. I don't know how to describe it. I hope I can continue to build this new relationship with my parents. 

Sometimes people really do change.",0
"A lot of stuff going on right now, but knowing everything will be okay makes me happy. üòá","So much happening in my life right now. Just ended 8 month of relationship, because i had the feeling we don't match as good as we thought. That's the worst right now, but I'm sure both of us will be happy eventually. He's a wonderfuan but it just didn't work as intended...

Moved to another city because of him, have my new home here and I plan so much for it to feel even more like home. My new job is better paid then my old one and gives me even more satisfaction with myself. Making new friends and a new life here I'm still happy, even if it looks a little dark right now. Mindset is everything.

Stay strong and healthy all of you and never forget: Better times are ahead! ‚ù§Ô∏è",0
"My boyfriend is teaching me to play Apex, it just makes me love him even more.","I think I've read somewhere before or heard that usually boyfriends would try to bring their girlfriend to play their favorite games with them. My boyfriends been begging me to play one of his favorites, Apex. He knows all the lore and often recites it to me excitedly. I love it.

I happen to suck at first person shooters, but since I've finally gotten a gaming console, he's been so supportive and sweet. Even if I'm sucking or get us killed he just jokes and we move on. I would often show stress about holding him back or being a shitty shot but he says ""you're still learning, we all start somewhere, dont worry"". 

When I finally got one of my first kills in a duo game with him he cheered me on and I was so happy even though we got tag teamed and died two seconds later lol. 

I love that we can share these moments together. It was such a short moment and small gestures, but he was so patient and makes me feel like I'm worth his time if it means we have one more interest to share and excuse to spend time together.

 He's the sweetest I just had to talk about it somewhere :)",0

He‚Äôs been bit, punched, spit at, so many things thrown, and every time, the student would later apologize because my dad just wanted to be there for them. He used to go to the kids‚Äô house and teach the parents how to handle outbursts, usually violent; one time a kid shot at his car from upstairs in their room. Yet, he is still there changing lives, loving the kids he works with. I‚Äôm proud to call him my dad.",0
It‚Äôs beautiful seeing someone you love take good care of themselves,"This morning, I was driving my 14 yo son to school and gave him my debit card to get his stuff from the gas station. Was kinda watching him through the big windows, and was really overcome w pride. He‚Äôs so strong, handsome, and capable : ) sometimes I get a glimpse of the man he‚Äôs growing into, and I am just so flippin proud of him. He‚Äôs quiet, but playful af. He‚Äôs a good listener. He‚Äôs the type that when he gives you a compliment, it *means something.* I just love the hell out of that boy! 

Last night, I helped him meal prep chicken, broccoli and rice for his lunch today. He wanted to cook hahaha. Wouldn‚Äôt let me do all the stuff! He‚Äôs lost about 15 lbs since July. We go to the gym together on the weekends; during the week he has football. Next year as a sophomore, coach says he starts varsity‚Äîthat‚Äôs awesome! As a person who‚Äôs really neglected their health for a long time, I am so grateful he‚Äôs learning good habits so young. He‚Äôs like my little health buddy! 

Had him pretty young (21), so in a lot of ways I feel like we grew up together. Looking back, seeing how immature I was, all the mistakes I made, I know how messed up we could be. The last 5 years, I‚Äôve been pretty honest about all the stuff I wish I would‚Äôve done differently‚ÄîI think it‚Äôs working lol. My heart is full of relief.

So I asked my nephew what he would do if he were the richest person in the world,I don‚Äôt know if this is supposed to be here still new to Reddit. I asked my nephew what he would do if he were the richest person in the world and I had good and bad feeling. He is young so he doesn‚Äôt know how the world really works but when I asked him the question he said that he would decorate the mall on Christmas as they always do on but when the child sat on Santa‚Äôs lap the parent can fill out a small survey where they can request what the child could want and have it sent to their house on Christmas Eve and he would pay for everything so when the child ask for something from Santa when they sit on his lap they can actually get the item they want. I guess he went through this and felt bad when he didn‚Äôt get what he asked for. I admit there are a few things he hasn‚Äôt thought through but the thought alone was so nice it almost had me tear up. But I also was worried about when he finds out how the world really works would he change his mind,0

Happy for New Opportunities and achievement of goals,"My hubby and I have both recently changed jobs. It was a long time in coming and he was very uncomfortable and unhappy with his previous position where he was working. 

When we graduated from college we both had degrees that  at the time were hard to break into. This included accounting as my hubby graduated in the height of the 2008-2009 recession. So we got married after I graduated and he practically gave up on his dream of working as an actual accountant/financial analyst. I still pushed him to study and volunteered him to try to apply regularly and to still have passion for the numbers that he had when he graduated. 

To make a long story very short he worked at his old job for 13 years and has ultimately hated it for the last 7. He never thought anything would change and was very unhappy with the way his life has turned out post degree. He was happy with his life as a husband and father but the job he was working gave him no joy. 

I still pushed him to apply and interviewed regularly because I could tell when we talked numbers at home he would light up and keeping us out of the red has always helped us in so many aspects of our marriage and being generous in the ways we could be. This summer it finally happened, he got a call back and was hired to at as an accountant. He would regale me with the things he was doing and the light and passion he has for the numbers has made him giddy on a regular basis. Yesterday marked his final day at his long time job. To which we know served us well but has left him heartsick in so many ways on to something so much better all around!! 

I am so happy that he gets to finally have this opportunity to enjoy what he does career wise and while I also started a new job I want to bask in his huge transition as it's been 13 years in the making.",0

I run the humidifier in my rooms at night and it feels like such a breathe of fresh air.  I have learned that although I don‚Äôt like being cold I thrive more in chilly areas so keep the fans on for a slight breeze.  I am also drinking lots of more water. I still love my wine but I now require myself to drink double the water before a drinking night and cut out drinking on any night before my work nights and school and feel more active.  I only go places to hangout that are planned unless it‚Äôs an immediate friend/family emergency which helps me save gas and lowers my cravings for spending money.  I only eat fast food 2 times a month to save money and eat lots of more healthy foods before and after fast foods to keep my mind focused.

I cannot wait for my partner to get home,"I'm just happy

TLDR I have a lovely partner

I've had a rough time of things romantically for quite a while. I dated someone for seven years and was engaged to them for about a year and it fell apart. It was strained and difficult by the end.  

About a year or so after that ended someone snatched me up and I was partnered again. Over a couple years we both realized our relationship didn't work and decided to split.

I tried a non committal relationship with someone else for a little bit after that and decided I didn't want that kind of relationship and not with that person anyways.

After a mildly messy end to the casual relationship I started dating E. They are so gosh darn lovely and have so much respect for my boundaries. I've never had someone actually respect my boundaries: I know it should be a given but it just had not  happened. They go out of their way to make me happy and every time that makes me want to cry.

They're out of the country for a family wedding until Wednesday evening and goodness I cannot wait until I can hold them in my arms again. 

That's it - I'm just so happy that I'm with someone who loves me and has treated me so very well after years and years of sadness and tension. I am so smitten with them and my heart sings every time I think of them",0

Finally feeling happy & content with myself after going through so much when I was just 18.,"I graduated high school with no close friends because they all dropped me and my long distance boyfriend who turned out toxic in the end.

 I was failing classes and feeling lonely every night to the point I cried for so many nights straight and losing weight for the wrong reasons. 

Getting jobs to make my parents proud such as full time office work where I wasn‚Äôt happy and my mental health was still low and getting fired from a high paying job and just knowing and feeling the disappointment in my parents and talking to the wrong guys I knew weren‚Äôt right for me. 

Legit having anxiety every night and desperately trying to find a comfort show or else I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I needed other people and other things to make me even close to content. I was desperately relying on anything else to make me happy and it was so toxic. 

This all happened when I was 18 and now I‚Äôm 19 and I have a new job filled with lovely people and I get to work with animals, part time. I‚Äôm taking fewer classes now so I don‚Äôt stretch myself so thin. Im taking a hybrid class so I can finally meet people who are on the same pace of life I‚Äôm at as well. I‚Äôm making enough to save but also spend on myself. Finally getting over the fear of disappointing my parents if I didn‚Äôt have a high paying job and even if they weren‚Äôt happy I finally was.

I can‚Äôt believe my love came back to me today after disappearing off the face of the planet for almost a month.,"Despite my best efforts to keep her happy and make her stay with me, she left me early August without a trace. No note or warning. 

I thought things were near perfect between us, and I thought I did everything I could to ensure she wouldn‚Äôt leave me. I was completely heartbroken seeing that she left me while I was having a Sunday brunch with my friends. I was only gone for about 2 hours and didn‚Äôt realize at the time how upset she was to be without me, even for short periods of time.

I gave her everything she could ever want and so much love and affection. She was the light of my life, and my world revolved around her the minute we met. I didn‚Äôt understand how she could just leave me without warning after everything I did for her. I was physically sick without her with me.

I asked so many people if they‚Äôve seen her around or knew where she was to no avail. I drove around town looking for her for weeks, but she successfully dodged me. I needed closure so badly and needed to at least know she was ok. I searched and searched for her, and even convinced some of my pals to help me track her down. She just vanished without a trace.

I finally decided the healthiest thing for me to do was to recognize that my love left me and was gone for good, and while I hoped she was ok and happy wherever she was, I‚Äôd most likely never hear from her again or know what happened. I‚Äôd most likely never get the closure I so desperately wanted. I was days away from closing this chapter and moving on.

That all changed this morning when my husband woke me up at 7:30 am telling me he had a surprise for me, and god dammit, he was holding my dog, the love of my life in his arms. I immediately started bawling my eyes out and kissed her entire face and she kissed mine. I thought after a month she was gone for good, but this baby was just chillin on the porch this morning. I guess she was over being a vagabond and wanted the good life again after exploring the last month.

And here I am, tearing up watching her snooze next to me. I can‚Äôt believe she came back. My heart is so full.",0

Someone took a chance on me and I'm not a bum anymore!,"Five months ago I was living exactly the I always feared growing up as a kid. I was 21, living in my parents basement, jobless and playing video games all day with no goals. I was a leach who provided nothing to society and it had been that way for 2 years since the pandemic. 
In April I applied for a wide variety of entry level jobs, searching for one that would take a guy with no job history and no credentials to do anything. Luckily, I met someone who has since become a massive influence towards me. I took an interview and it went amazing, I was offered the job right away and lied, saying I had more interviews that day and offers I needed to consider. Later that night I called that job back and took thier offer. I started in an industry I had absolutely no idea about in a very limited role. 
Since then, this boss has taken me under thier wing and taught me just how valuable I can be. They've not only boosted my self confidence, but my quality of living as one month ago I moved with them to become a manager at another property. Today at 22 years old I make a little over 50k a year as a salaried manager and I am so happy and thankful for this chance that someone took on me, that literally changed my life.",0

I feel like one of those cartoons where the character gets a peck on the cheek from a sexy girl, and they get heart-eyes, click their heels together, and start floating through the air doing loop-de-loops! I don‚Äôt want to lose this ‚Äúhigh‚Äù!

Invited two of my friends to binge-watch a TV Show online and now they're married!," So, I'll try to be brief because it's a long story, but here it is! I've been vibing with my friends Alex (26F) and Sam (27F) over Killing Eve for ages on Tumblr. We'd analyze, debate, and fangirl (lol) over every episode. I introduced them to each other and one day, I had the idea of gathering my online friends to binge watch the show together. Alex suggested Kosmi, so she created a virtual room there, sent me the link and soon enough, we had our little group together. There we were, a bunch of Killing Eve die-hards, from different parts of the world, streaming and sharing our most crazy theories in the chat. But as we went on, I couldn't help but notice some flirting going on between Alex and Sam. Between our group's playful banters and episode recaps, these two wouldn't shut up. I was one to notice since I was in a long distance relationship myself. They'd poke fun at each other's wild predictions and had VERY long discussions that certainly weren't about the show anymore, haha. A few binges later, Sam pulls me into a DM. ""Hey, you won't believe this, but Alex and I are kind of...official now. All thanks to those 'Killing Eve' nights on Kosmi.""

I was shook. Totally didn't see it coming, but hey, love finds a way, right?

So, anyone else accidentally become a matchmaker in the most unexpected of places?

TL:DR My close friends married after we joined to watch a TV Show.

N is out to their parents as queer, while I am not out to mine. Their entire family knows we‚Äôre dating and have sworn up and down not to tell my parents until I‚Äôm ready. Their school ends after mine and I have a timer to text them a meme or picture everyday right when they get out. Once they came and visited and I told them a fun fact that if you give someone a fully not broken soda can tab they can exchange it back to you as a kiss. They made a bit the whole visit to try to not break it every time they opened a soda can as a joke. I told them it made me uncomfortable and they stopped. Like that. Sometimes they still send me pictures of tabs they manage to not break. Frankly, it‚Äôs impressive. We‚Äôre both artists and before Valentine‚Äôs Day we always have a FaceTime call where we make each other‚Äôs cards and try not to let the other person guess what it is.

Got a hair cut after two years of bad mental health and am so happy I finally did it!,"My original post was deleted bc the title was not specific enough and I couldn't copy and paste, so here's the picture of what I wrote.",0
"I'm Looking Forward to Waking up Again, and For Future Days!","Sorry for such a long post, I just have so much I'm appreciative of and happy about these days :,)

I have had mental health problems for a long time. But on top, the years 2020 and 2021 were brutal for me. Shortened: I lost my best friend and couldn't make proper new friends because I was just looking for her. I realized I was in a horrible, toxic relationship and finally took in people's concerns that I may be getting groomed and left him. Got used by another partner directly after and ghosted and was devastated.

Later that year (2021), I got together with my current boyfriend. I knew him for many years before and had feelings here and there, and he said it was the same for him and it just sort of worked out :) We aren't perfect as no relationship is, but I finally feel loved and he makes me genuinely want to wake up the next day. It's still so strange to me that someone is genuinely willing to put in effort to try and solve their communication issues to have a better relationship with me. He makes it clear he wants to spend time with me, and plans out for us to do things together. This was never a thing for me before, so it just makes me so happy to finally be in a good relationship. 

We've been together for over 2 years now and I am moving in with him in 59 days!! I'm so excited because also..! His family has been constantly asking my mom and me to move over there and live in their second house since my mom struggles a lot where we are.. she consistently said no before but now I convinced her and she actually seems happy and excited toward it too! Seeing my mom excited and happy just fills me with joy and knowing that things will be financially be better over there (we know it will after looking into everything, this has been planned for a while now) is such a relief. I have been able to provide some extra support to my mom but it's wasn't very much. I'm so happy because the main reason I did not want to move before was being so far away from my mom, but now she's coming with me! I love my mom and can't wait till things are easier for her.

The best friend I lost? We lost eachother because of a huge miscommunication and confusion due to another friend being jealous of our friendship and taking my best friend's at the time very weak mental state to her advantage to cut off all her friends. Not only are we best friends again as of Semptember 2022, but we have amazing communication and we know we can go to each other for EVERYTHING, no matter what dumb reason and what time of night. I seriously cannot believe I have her as my best friend again! She is irreplaceable.

And I met her amazing girlfriend she got together with in the time we weren't friends. She is genuinely such an amazing human being and I consider her one of my closest and best friends now. I'm so happy because she finally got a better paying job and all of her co-workers and bosses are amazing people who actually have consideration for her as a person unlike her previous jobs. Them two and me and my boyfriend frequently spend time together online playing games, as my best friend ended up moving to the state her girlfriend lived in to escape her family situation. Funnily enough she got together with her the same day I got together with my boyfriend, what a strange coincidence.

Now, this is a red state and not only are they a lesbian couple but my best friend is also a trans woman. It's tough out there for them medically (her hormone doctor keeps getting harassed and they had to close in person meetings because of this, and my best friend herself is scared any time they go out) so they decided they want to try and move to the state my boyfriend is in (and me and my mom will be soon too!). This was probably going to be much after me and my mom originally due to not making much money and expensive costs of course but her new job is a game changer. I'm helping them save up too with what I can!

Now the cherry on top? I made a gofundme to get them to the safe state and wasn't expecting much. We had a 6k goal because that's the amount they'd need for moving, stuff on the way, first month rent and deposit. Can you guys believe that 1000 dollars has been donated? I was expecting maybe a hundred dollars but we got a 6th of our total goal already, meaning they can probably move sometime next year. I wanted to cry of happiness that there are genuinely people kind enough to help my friends and it makes me so happy because I love and appreciate them so much and just want happiness for them.

I'm just so excited to start my new life with my partner, mom, and soon two best friends of my life as well.

I'm getting into hobbies I had that I previously lost from being depressed. I'm getting into new ones! I'm going outside by choice and spending time with family and friends. My anxiety is very, very bad but I'm learning to manage it so less body pains from it has been amazing.

I just felt like sharing because I had never in my life thought I'd have so many things to look forward to in life, yet now it's happening because of people in my life that genuinely love me, and recently it genuinely feels like I can't contain the happiness. I hope you all are having an amazing day. Thanks for reading, if anyone gets this far!",0
Cool story about intelectual disability (and chicken),"So, there are 2 rotisserie chicken stores on my town's main road. Store A is run by people with some kind of intelectual disability, and store B is run by people who don't seem to have any disability.

Sunday midday, it's raining, and people are lining up to buy rotisserie chicken for lunch (big meal where I'm from).

Store A has 5x more queue than store B.

These people aren't seen as less because of their condition, instead people line up to get what they have to offer.

So don't let your conditions make you think you are less. Hard work pays off!

Edit: My point is that their chicken is better quality, and that disability did not stop them from having the best chicken in town",0

"Dearest Seekers of Wisdom, Pioneers of Parenthood & Those Who Dare to Dream Beyond Years","

I, Danny, a humble navigator of life's grand paradox, extend to you an invitation. An invitation not merely to the Fountain of Youth, but to the uncharted realms of understanding, wherein my three daughters and awe-inspiring wife have revealed to me the profound truths of existence.

Have you ever considered the irony of parenting? It ages you, yet makes you young again. How can such a paradox be?

üçÉ Danny's Musings on Eternal Youth Through the Eyes of Children üçÉ

Embrace the Timelessness of Inquiry: My daughters ask, ""Why?"" They question the sky, the earth, even the logic behind bedtime. And in those questions, they've taught me to seek, to wonder, and to always remain a curious child at heart.
Find Joy in the Fleeting Moments: They grow so fast, yet time seems to stand still in their presence. They've taught me that immortality isn't about infinite years, but about deeply living in every single moment.
Love's Eternal Spring: With every scraped knee I've kissed and every bedtime story I've told, I've found love's ability to rejuvenate the soul. My wife and I, weathered by life, become young again as we watch our girls explore the world.
But beware, fellow explorers of youth: The path is fraught with contradictions. The same little hands that hand you a crayon drawing (and melt your heart) also gleefully smear spaghetti on the wall. The same eyes that look to you with pure innocence wake you up at 3 AM with the most existential of inquiries.

Is this not the dance of life? The perfect balance between chaos and calm, old and new, wisdom and innocence?

Through my girls, I've seen the essence of being young, not as a physical state, but as a spiritual journey. They've made me realize that aging isn't the enemy; losing our childlike wonder is. They‚Äôve brought me face to face with the fleeting nature of time and yet instilled a belief in the eternity of love.

What is youth, if not a state of mind? What is eternity, if not the impact we leave on those we love?

So here's to my family, my fountain of youth, my philosophical guides in a world that too often forgets to dream, to laugh, and to see with the heart.

May we all embrace the contradiction that is growing old with young hearts, and may we never lose sight of the child within.

In perpetual wonderment and love,
Danny

P.S. To those who fear the march of time, know this: The wrinkles are but laugh lines, memories of joy etched into the soul. They are not the end of youth, but the profound affirmation of a life well-lived. üåü",0
