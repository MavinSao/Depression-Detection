Javascript - trying but no progress,"Stuck at introductory javascript and don't know how to deal with the frustration. Been stuck on two problems, going on two weeks now. Got a few replies on stackoverflow and tried their solutions then tweaking the code but still unsuccessful of desired outcome. Have been trying to follow the ""5 questions to a question"" method:

1. What do you think the problem is?
2. What exactly do you want to happen?
3. What is actually happening?
4. How did you get there?
5. What have you tired so far?

And get stuck trying to write out an answer to question 4.

Don't know how to find joy in coding whilst being unable to build a carousel or hide a product card using functions and if statements. This is my 2nd attempt at self taught web development and its starting to feel like I don't have the mental capacity for puzzles (not trying to have a defeatist attitude).

Success!,"So I started learning Python about 5-6 months ago. As an analyst I quickly and heavily integrated Python into my daily workflow, and I’ve picked up a little html/css/js along the way. About a month ago, I built a little CLI tool to help our department. The third party equivalent, which we were using at the time, took 4 hours to run. Mine - 30 seconds. The director of operations (my boss’ boss) caught wind and wanted to distribute this in a way that more people had access. Yesterday, I presented my ground-up Flask webapp (it still needs backend work, but the front end is functional) and he loves it. I have to meet with the IT director and then it’s going to be hosted on the internal network with any luck. My first little full stack project for the world to see!

Just wanted to share my little win. I don’t think people realize how much work it’s taken to get to this point in 6 months, or how awesome it is to be *able* to show my value as someone with so little experience.",0
how useful is it to learn python?,im very new to programming and from what i ve been searching it seems companies barely ask for python knowledge ? do we learn python just to get an idea of how programming works and then we are just gonna forget about it and learn something else like C# or C++ or java  and never use python again ?,0
What kind of programming skills/knowledge do you possess?,Hi all. I'm really interested in programming specifically web development from frontend to backend. I haven't gone to school for programming but I am taking online courses just to get my foot in the door before I make the decision to go back to school. I know i need to focus on the basics and not bite more than I can chew. But I was wondering ...what's your skills set? It doesn't have to only relate to web development. Also what skills do you think everyone should have moving forward? Ai? Data structures and algorithm? ,0
When did development stop feeling like climbing Everest with no gear?,"I recently started as a Junior Developer at the company I've been working at for almost 3 years. It took me a while to convince the CTO to give me a shot and it finally happened. It has been the biggest success of my life.

I'm a month in and I'm not sure I'm capable. From learning the codebase, understanding the technologies, and getting hands on, it all feels impossible. It feels like I'm running in place and I never get anywhere.

Am I supposed to feel this way? Do things get easier to understand? Or could this mean that development isn't for me?",0
Best Way to Plan the Development of a Web App,"Hello! I am about to begin the development of my first web app. I have a solid understanding of the technologies I’ll be using (Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS). Before I begin working on it, I imagine it’s best to outline and plan out what each of my tasks. For those who have experience, what’s the best approach to outlining the requirements? What level of detail is needed? How small should each of the tasks be? Thank you!",0
What programming language should I learn?,"Backend: I'm 38 year old. Don't have a job. I'm on dialysis. Don't have wife, nor kids. Have fair amount of free time, especially in winter. My English is not perfect. Back in the pandemic outbreak time I sat and learnt some JAVA. Finished Helsinki's MOOC online free course and made a program for sorting out family's financial issues and that was it. I forgot almost everything since but I think it wouldn't be too hard to freshen the memory.

User case: I don't imagine I'm gonna be paid programmer. I want to know it because I kinda like to tinker. I want to learn because I want to make my free time somewhat useful and it's kinda rewarding when you can make something on your own and solve problems. I have few little personal projects in mind which would work the best on mobile devices (android). And if it takes off from there I could maybe make some little money as a freelancer, who knows.

The means: I don't have big funds so I want it cheap (preferably free). Good and clear free or cheap online courses are important factor.

In the retrospective learning JAVA was probably wrong direction for me as a starting point. I think there are so many better languages for starting small. And in order to keep interest long enough I need to start with small fun projects before I lose myself in owerwhelming code. I set my eyes on Kotlin but I'm not sure if that's the right direction to start off. Very confused by various opinions. Hopefully it clears out a bit after I process enough information. Your suggestions with some additional context are welcome. Also If you can suggest good place to start it off, that would be perfect.

Thanks for your time 🙂

Fuel Economy App,"I am trying to create a fuel economy app for cars and aircraft. The goal of the app is to alert the driver/pilot on the best speeds to drive in for optimum endurance. 

I have the syntax/algorithm for everything written in C++, but I’m struggling with a couple parts: 

1) The formula/algorithm requires user to input the frontal surface area of their automobile or wing surface area on aircrafts….however, I find that it’ll be tedious for them to calculate it. For Automobiles,  I’m thinking to add some AI/ML functionality to the program which allows the user to take picture of their car in order to derive the frontal area. I have no clue how to actually begin this. Is this possible or can someone guide me on how to do this??

2) The codebase is written in C++, so how do I go from the code on visual studio to an actually app the can be downloaded from the Apple/Android App Store. No idea how to do this.

3) The app will alert the user when they reach said optimal speed. How would I have the app retrieve current speed data on the car/airplane in real time. Ultimately, I will attempt to implement this into a larger algorithm for self driving cars or UAV system in which the goal would be to always find the optimum speed for endurance in any condition.",0

Need Help Understanding MVC architecture,"I am working on a school project. I've decided to go with making a music player app, the project description calls for the project to be done using the MVC architecture, I've learnt about it in class but it was not really put into practice and I am having issues understanding how to implement it into my project.

Is there a 'correct' way to code?,"Hi all, I'm have been learning Python and JavaScipt online for a while with the aim of changing my career path.

One of the problems I keep thinking to myself is 'am I coding this properly?'. I'm working on a blackjack game at the moment and everything I'm coding up is eventually working as intended but I have no idea if I'm doing it 'properly'. Or even if there is such a thing as 'correct' programming.

Not having an opportunity to work as part of a group in a degree or large project is maybe causing this due to lack of feedback I'm getting. I will eventually look at contributing to open source once I've improved and I know working within a standardized code base will help with this.

Am I overthinking this and am I worrying about a problem that doesn't exist?

Program execution visualization.,"I was thinking that it would have been nice to have a program that would create some sort of visual representation of the hardware's state during the execution of a program.

Let's say, you enter some code, perhaps something simple, with no includes, no external libraries or anything, and then step through it's execution, like in a debugger, while also getting some sort of visual representation of what goes on in the program's memory space. Like, what does program code look like in memory and how it is read, show how the stack is growing as the functions are called, show how objects are allocated on the heap, how they are ""deleted"" (or not) and how the memory they occupied is reused, etc. Maybe show the state of CPU registers too, and what goes in and out of them. That sort of stuff.

Does anyone know if programs like that exist? Maybe some IDEs have super fancy debuggers that show something like that? I think it would've been a cool tool for learning purposes.",0

Worry about learning several languages,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to ask for some opinions on this. I started learning web development around a year and a half ago, partly because I want to switch careers and partly because I am just in general interested in computers and I used to enjoy programming when I was younger. I got really into it, following the Odin Project, and was enjoying it so much, and as much as I enjoy Web Design, both Front-end and Back-end, I realised that I wanted to delve deeper into learning about computers and networks, particularly building and designing software. I've been studying pretty intensely for the year and a half, as my job allows me a lot of free time, but I still consider myself a beginner. I decided I wanted to get serious about the change in careers and enrolled into a CS degree.

I am happy about my decision, and very excited to get started learning Computer Science, even though I still consider myself a beginner. The course's first modules are in Java and C, which I expected, and I have made a start with learning Java, and am enjoying it, even finding a lot of concepts familiar from my previous studies. 

The trouble is I feel like I have made great progress with learning Javascript and React with the Odin Project and have made some projects that I am really proud of. I don't want to completely disregard those skills as I start my course. I have also seen on the vast majority of job openings, even for software development, that web development skills are either required or highly desirable. So I figured that I would try to split my time between the 3 languages as best as I can.

I guess I'm a little bit worried as I read many times that it's unwise to learn several languages at once, and I find that advice reasonable, but I don't just want to put Javascript down to switch languages, when I feel like I still have so much more to learn. Is it unrealistic to even consider juggling the three at such an early stage?",0

"""Proper"" way to organize functions","I joined a new team and I'm finding constant  disagreements on the organization of code, specifically:


1. Where to put the if statement, inside or outside the function. 

I try to let each function have a single purpose, meaning I sometimes will split condition checking and do them in separate, nested functions instead of making a long chain of conditions to check. They want me to do all the checks together, either inside or outside the function. 
For example, I would do 


    if is_animal:

        feed_animal(animal)


    function feed_animal(animal):

        if animal.color == 'brown' and animal.size=='big

            # do stuff

But they want the is_animal condition INSIDE the feed_animal function, and just call the function all the time. I feel that it's unnecessary addition to the call stack when you're not going to execute if it's not even an animal. 


    


2. What are defined as args to a function. 

I want to pass nested values that I already have references to, so I make it an argument. They want me to drill down to get the value again, even if I already have the reference to it because, one less arg for the function.

    arg3 = object['b']['c']['d']

    foo(object, arg2, arg3)

They want 

    foo(object, arg2)

    function foo(object, arg2):

        arg3 = object['b']['c']['d']

I also have a utility function that will assign the appropriate objects to this variables. For example, i have function activeProjectInitialize which assigns the active project and active sequence to the global variables. 

Whenever the user press a button and call a function, I will also run the activeProjectInitialize to assign the current active objects to their respective global variables.

Does this stuff come more easily with time?,"What I'm wondering is if you're very slow and struggle a lot now, is it probably always going to be that way, or does problem solving and coding get easier and your thinking get sharper with time? And I mean really, really struggling and really slow. 

I'm learning to program with programming principles and practice using C++ by bjarne stroustrup and I'm struggling big time. I do have some cognitive difficulties to begin with unfortunately - I have ADHD so I've always had a poor working memory and some difficulty focusing, although it's easier for me to focus with I enjoy something, I enjoy programming and problem solving. It's just too bad that I'm so bad at something that actually engages me so much and I genuinely enjoy. Right now I'm doing it as a hobby - I have a lot of medical issues that keep me from working right now and I had to drop out of school. My former plan was to study computer science with the goal of eventually being a software developer (right before I stopped going I hadn't picked a major yet, but was about to change it the following semester before my health took a nosedive). Over the years in addition to my health issues I've developed cognitive impairment is well - specifically with my memory, ability to remember and learn information, and processing speed. 

So.. that's not great, I know. If I ever am well enough to work again I would still want to be a software developer, so I figured I could at least try to learn on my own to see if this is something I could be capable of doing (I had done some coding in high school, but not a whole bunch). But.. it's extremely hard for me. The problem solving, and to a lesser extent, putting the solution into code. Some of the exercises stump me immensely in the book. and when I try to figure out, I'm straining my brain and things just aren't coming together quickly, sometimes i eventually get it but it takes *ages* of thinking really hard, when it probably is fairly trivial. Sometimes I never get it and need to Google. I guess what I'm wondering is could it get easier over time if I keep work at it? Is this something I can train my brain to do, or is this just how it is? If I'm like this now, will it probably always be this way and I'll always struggle to solve problems? Is this a sign software development is not something I could handle as a career?

MDN or FullStackOpen for learning web development?,"Hey there,

I wanted to know which of these two courses would you recommend to someone with a decent programming knowledge but almost zero experience in web development (I have a master degree in computer engineering)?

I should mention that the main reason I'm learning web development is not to get a job in the field but to get a good understanding of how it works so I can build a website for my current and future projects. Also, when I learn something I seek for deep understanding of the subject which is why I'm trying to decide between these two as I heard a lot of good things about both.

I know this is a question with no right answer but just wanted to hear your opinion :)

It would also be helpful to get some rough estimate on how long the MDN would take compared to FSO? I found that average time per course on FSO is 15-20 hours but didn't find anything time related about MDN.

Understanding Alembic naming convention and detecting constraint changes,"A while back, I posted that I had added a constraint to class in a Flask-SQLAlchemy project, something like:

    class User(db.Model, SerializerMixin):
        __tablename__ = ""users""
        __table_args__ = (
    db.CheckConstraint(""length(name) >= 5""),
    )
    
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String)

When I added the constraint, Alembic wasn't detecting the changes (running `flask db migrate` returned ""no changes to the schema detected."") A fellow user helpfully responded with links to the docs that explained Alembic will not detect anonymously named constraints. That makes sense, so I tried adding a name parameter, something like:

    __table_args__ = (
    db.CheckConstraint(""length(name) >= 5"", name=""check_name_length""), )

That didn't work either, still no changes to the schema detected. Then I thought: ""Hey, they suggest using the 'naming convention' for this purpose, right?""

    convention = {
    ""ix"": ""ix_%(column_0_label)s"", 
    ""uq"": ""uq_%(table_name)s_%(column_0_name)s"", 
    ""ck"": ""ck_%(table_name)s_%(constraint_name)s"", 
    ""fk"": ""fk_%(table_name)s_%(column_0_name)s_%(referred_table_name)s"", 
    ""pk"": ""pk_%(table_name)s"" }

My thinking was that the naming convention provides names where they are otherwise not provided, right? (Am I understanding that correctly?) So let's pop that into our MetaData and see what happens, and...nope. It says it expects a constraint\_name. Which, sure enough, that's what I see in `""ck"": ""ck_%(table_name)s_%(constraint_name)s""`

&#x200B;

So now I feel completely turned around. If the naming convention provides a name for a constraint that isn't named, how would it...require a named constraint? Am I misunderstanding how a naming convention works? Is there even a connection to what I was originally trying to do with the table\_args and Check Constraint there? I've been going around with this for hours and am just quick-sanding into further misunderstanding, I feel. Can anyone help me detangle how this works? Many, many thanks!",0

For those who don't know what it is: it is an advent calendar of programming prompts/challenges. Every day from the 1^st to the 25^th a new puzzle will unlock at midnight EST. Each puzzle consists of two parts that usually are closely linked. The second part only unlocks after the first part has been solved.

For every puzzle there is some (kind of) unique input that needs to be used to calculate/program some output. This output has to be entered into the web page to unlock the next part/complete the puzzle for the day.

There are no limits to what languages, tools, etc. can be used.

There are no prizes. The challenge is free for everyone.

Mimick creating a hook conditionally,"Hello, sorry for the bad formatting.

Let’s say I have a react hook that takes in a code and returns a function like so:

const [fn] = useHook(code)

I have an eventlistener that would be able to provide this hook with the code. I want to do something like this:

const event = (code) => {

          const [fn] = useHook(code)
          fn()

}

Obviously, I wouldn’t be able to create a hook conditionally like this. How would I go about creating this logic legally? Just as a note, I am not able to change anything about useHook at all.

"I'm slowly figuring out how to implement a reasonable collision detection with no help other than some general internet tips, how can I make use of a parameterized surface?","I'm learning C++ on my own to work on some basic artistically-inspired simulations and effects that I would like to eventually integrate into an app, and I'm trying to understand the math of how I detect collisions for an arbitrary environmental surface, which can include mesas, caves, trees, etc. I'm starting with something that I guess I would consider ""simple"" in comparison to top-tier libraries out there:

I'm starting with 2D, ordinary x-y coordinates. Before doing anything, I had to think about whether I wanted to define each line segment as an x-y function, or, parametrically as x(s) = as + b, y(s) = cs+d.

I went with the parametric representation for two reasons:-I don't have to worry about multiple output values for one input value and decide which I want to use, and,-I don't have to deal with infinite tangents.I do lose some computational efficiency, but it makes swirly non-convex shapes and adjustments more manageable too, and further I might also be able to control which portions of the shape are visible with a simple slider.

For these x-y coordinates, let's fast-forward suppose I have defined a simple, closed but non-convex (potentially very swirly surface)  parametric shape of several line segments, like L1(x(s),y(s)) which connects to L2(x(s),y(s)) which connects to L3(x(s),y(s)) ...

Now, what I didn't know right away, but had to think about, is that for each domain of each line segment, like s in Domain1, s in Domain2, s in Domain3... that s as a continuous variable cannot actually be fully realized by a computer, it probably must be discretized.

For my purposes, I'm going to initially choose a step-size for s of 0.05, and then render or process what each specific point must then be, I think, I hope, maybe. This is because initially, I'm not going to worry about the landscape ""changing"", I'm going to assume the landscape is static and immovable.

\---

The objects that will collide with the surface will start with with simple boxes and spheres, not just points, so I have to additionally think about the geometry which the internet provided some helpful tips on.

Let's say a sphere is close to a pair of line segments defined by L1 = (x(s) = s, y(s) = s), L2 = (x(s) = s, y(s) = -(1/2)s + 3/2).

Then let's say the center of a sphere of a moving, time-changing object is (x\_p(t), y\_p(t)), this is the center of a collision sphere whose position changes over time.

Then, I suspect based on what I've been told is that I need to check, for instance with LineSegment2, that

sqrt( ( x\_p - s)\^2 + (y\_p - (-(1/2)s+3/2))\^2 ) <= r, where r is the radius of the sphere.

This is still confusing to me somewhat though, I'm going about this on my own with no reputable guidance, I don't know entirely ""how"" I efficiently check this against so many discrete points or if this is even the right thing to check in the first place. How do I know how and when to vary s? Or do I not vary s at all during a simulation because I've already supposedly ""pre-rendered"" all points I want of each line segment using my 0.05 step size?

I also have an additional concern that my sphere will ""miss"" points. It's safe to assume the radius of the sphere is considerably larger than 0.05, but the sphere itself is also an approximation, and I don't know much about the machinery of how C++ can validate an inequality.

Clingo is unsatisfiable (forcing all combinations) even though it should not be,"In this Clingo program I was defining that there are 2 cars, 2 parcels and that there are assignments made of a parcel and a car but Clingo is forcing all possible combinations of assignments instead of just allowing them.  
  
The following code is unsatisfiable:  


>parcel(1,a,1,110).  
parcel(2,b,1,90).  
  
%Define car predicate  
car(1).  
car(2).  
  
%Define assign predicate  
assign(P,C) :- parcel(P,\_,\_,\_), car(C).  
not assign(1,1).

  
  
Even if i remove the last line and add:  


>1 {car(C): assign(P,C)} 1 :- parcel(P,\_,\_,\_).

  
Stating that every parcel should have exactly 1 car, it is still unsastisfiable. This does not make sense since the first Clingo code only defined ""assign"" as a predicate which has a parcel and a car, and not every possible combination.

Is my path to dev reasonable?,"I have a bachelor's degree in biology and have been at a loss for where to go in my career lately.

The job I will be accepting pays around 57,000 yearly. I am 24 currently so it is certainly livable in my current situation, but there is really no upward mobility or future in the field without medical school.

Dealing with project - scale anxiety,"Do you know that feeling in a video game where you finish the tutorial and the game opens up, and suddenly you can go to 600 different routes and quests? You can build your characters in 9000 different ways. And if you go to a specific route you fear you might miss something in other routes. Or if you build your character a certain way you'll discover that the other way is way more fun late game.

&#x200B;

That's me in coding. I think I am a very capable programmer and can do great things if they stay small scale (build a component that does x or y). But when I have to monitor a project by myself, let's say at home, I get filled with anxiety and then completely give it up. 

I start questioning file structure. Where should this file go? Is it correct to call this that way? Do I even need a folder for all of that? 

Then I start questioning my components. Do I have too much logic on this component? It's too long. But moving this logic will take some time. Maybe I should leave it for later? No but that will make it even harder. But I am not even sure if I need to move it.

Then I question my server. Is it safe? I'm just making calls to the server, I have no idea how to make this communication between my front and back safe. I have to learn about data security. But that'll take a long time. Maybe I should do it later? No but then I'll have to refactor so much. But data security is a big topic, so now what? Do I stop everything and learn about it or leave it for later?

&#x200B;

Writing these I see it looks like I'm just being aware of downfalls and try to stop them which is fine. But I can't put into words how it makes me feel. I start writing the most simple idea ever and just stop because suddenly I'm facing a thousand concerns about how the project looks and how I have to anticipate every little downfall before it gets messy and I either refactor for 2 months or throw the project away.

&#x200B;

This really makes it so I never code in my free time anymore, which I really need to because I need new projects for my resume. I know I love coding and I used to really enjoy it when I learned how to write a function or create a simple app but once I started working in the field and realized how big this world is, every line I write feels like a mistake. What do you do with this? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I love coding but the amount of stuff I need to anticipate ahead of time in a project's lifetime gives me anxiety to the point I just don't make projects. Since seeing ""real"" projects and working in the industry, every line I write feels like a mistake. What can I do to change this? ",0

How to get past the Intermediate Python Plateau?,"I’m on an intermediate plateau I think a lot of self-taught programmers reach and I’m wondering how to get past it. Some ideas based on what I’ve researched online:

1. Frontend stack - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
     - Pros: Everything is a web app. Best stack for deploying projects. More employable. 
     - Cons:  Not improving core programming skills. Lots of boilerplate that can be tedious. 

2. GUI libraries - pytkinter, pyqt
     -Pros: Can create user-friendly projects in pure Python. 
     -Cons: Much worse for deploying than doing a web app in terms of marketability and maintainability. Not os agnostic. 

3. Lisp, C, or another more challenging language
     -Pros: Improves core programming skills. Exposure to concepts that have been abstracted away in Python. Performance improvements relative to Python’s speed. Many people swear that Lisp/C opens your third eye and makes you one with the Dao. (And the backend is where the real work gets done, right?)
     - Cons: Delaying the inevitable of learning how to build a frontend/gui for users.

Which route is better?

To expand on the “intermediate plateau”, I’m at a stage where I can confidently program most projects I think of. I can work with public APIs, build my own APIs with Flask, do web scraping, work with file systems, databases, scrape pdfs, do data analysis in pandas, write OO classes using domain-driven design (thanks Cosmic Python). I automate tasks with Python at my job. Just wondering what to learn next to become a better programmer and to maximize the use I get out of programming. 

Note to mods: this is a different question than how to go from beginner to intermediate, as stated in the FAQ. I’m already at the point of actively learning, trying my own projects and using Python professionally. I’m hoping this thread will foster detailed discussion on how to get past the intermediate plateau. To that end I’ve front-loaded my post with my research and summarized 3 options.

Little help for debug in a random walk,"Hi, I am studying physics and we are working with random walks.

When i compile I don't get any errors but when i read the output on a .dat file or see the graphs, there are too many  ""media2/M"" (average value for the X\^2, so it should be always positive) negative values and the graphs of ""media/M"" is a line but it should be random.

"If you make a getter and setter methods for a private variable, doesn't that defeat the purpose of ""privatizing"" a variable?","I'm still qute new in encapsulation ideas. In  python, you could access non private variables of a class using the dot operator. You could do everything that a getter and setter method would do, by just using the dot operator. But if you privatize it, by adding a dunder in front of the variable, you can't do this anymore and need to rely on getter and setter methods. So if you implement both methods, why don't you just don't privatize the variable?

I can see the point if we just implemented a getter or setter method independently, but not implementing them BOTH. cause if we implement them both, just don't privatize the variable and reduce a few lines of code.",0

"Seeking Clarification: Are C++, C#, and Java Pure OOP Languages?","Greetings everyone! I could use a bit of help as I've come across various perspectives on this topic, and it's left me a bit perplexed. The question at hand is:

  
Is C++ not a pure OOP language (since it can function without classes and objects)? This is definitely true, but, on the other hand, for C#, some argue that it is pure, while others say it's not (everything is treated as an object). Similarly, there's conflicting information about Java—some claim it's pure OOP, while others argue it isn't. The multitude of opinions has left me quite bewildered.

  
So, here's a straightforward question: Are C++, C#, and Java considered pure OOP languages or not?

  
I'm preparing for an interview, and despite initially thinking I understood the answer, further research has only added to my confusion. I appreciate any insights or clarifications on this matter!

Choosing Between Leet Code and Coding Ninjas for DSA Practice,"I'm on the lookout for a platform to practice my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills, and I've narrowed down my choices to LeetCode and Coding Ninjas. Both platforms seem to offer extensive datasets of DSA questions, but I'm having a hard time deciding between the two.  
  
LeetCode is often touted as the go-to platform by many, and I understand that it's considered one of the best for DSA practice. It's been around for a while and is widely recognized. However, recently, I stumbled upon Coding Ninjas, which also boasts a comprehensive collection of problems.  
  
Now, here's where my confusion sets in. While I acknowledge that problems are not scarce on the internet and I can practice coding by myself, I'm drawn to the idea of maintaining consistency through a problem-solving dashboard, particularly for live practice sessions. LeetCode and Coding Ninjas has a well-known dashboard, and many have found it beneficial for placements and interviews.  
  
Here's my question is: is Coding Ninjas would it be a good alternative for a beginner like me who's looking to stay consistent and focused on DSA problem-solving?  
  
I'm aware that many factors contribute to the effectiveness of a coding platform, and personal preferences play a significant role. So, I'd love to hear your insights and experiences. As a beginner, what platform would you recommend, and why? Have any of you tried both LeetCode and Coding Ninjas?

Full stack vs app development,"Hello! I’m a 31 year old veterinarian who is interested in learning programming for my own self-interests, but I am totally lost on where to start. I was interested in computer science in undergrad, but fell in love with biology and ended up becoming a veterinarian.

I enjoy my career and am not looking for a career change, but I’d like to learn programming to work on a new skill set and work on some projects I’ve always wanted to develop. 

My problem is that there is so much information and my interests are too diverse to figure out where to start. I’ve done research for several days/weeks, but still have not come to a conclusion. For example, here are some of my programming goals:

1. My wife and I always wanted to start a fantasy-themed tavern. I’ve wanted to develop a mobile app game that utilizes codes printed on receipts and events held at the tavern for in-game perks.

2. My wife has a side business hand making native jewelry and currently has a e-commerce website for it, but I’m not sure if she would benefit from someone who knows how to code and if that could result in any improvements.

3. I’m interested in data management, web scraping, analyzing, and publishing data on a website as a means to share information and resources in a central location.

4. I’m interested in developing tools such as Twitch.tv apps to help streamers in a variety of ways.

5. I’ve always been interested in RPG game development for mobile platforms.

So a lot of my interests are mixed between games, mobile app, and web development. My limitations with mobile app development is that I’ve exclusively used Windows my life, but have iOS mobile devices so I’d have to buy an iOS laptop or desktop to code in Swift. That’s a big investment for someone as me who has the varied interests and am just trying to find where to start. 

One question I have is the difference between full stack developers and mobile developers. I would suspect mobile app development does front and back end, but it’s not the same as a full stack developer. Many resources seem to focus on full stack as a means for web development specifically, but i understand that websites are apps in their own right.

I’m trying to decide where to start in all this. I’ve looked at Codecademy and it sounds superficial, I’ve looked at Coursera but I wouldn’t know where to start. I have access to Codeacademy pro through a family member who bought a year membership but chose not to use it.

"Been mostly using JavaScript out of habit for writing small desktop scripts, curious if there's greener pastures to be found with Python or other languages","I have a number of small personal projects that I've thrown together over the years for various purposes, including sending commands between multiple computers, setting up and organizing windows for certain tasks, and remapping controller inputs in unconventional ways. I've always just defaulted to JavaScript for just about all of it since it's what I know and what I'm familiar with.

However, I've been wondering if it might be worth my time learning a different language. When I have a particular task in mind, I'll go looking to see if there's any code available online that already covers what I want--and feels like while I'll often find code I'm looking for, it is *very* often written in Python. I know Python tends to be much less of a hassle to learn and work with than JavaScript and all its weirdness, but it has me wondering if it might be worth making the switch? Which in turn had me wondering:

Maybe there's a better programming language I've been overlooking, be it Python or otherwise?

In a perfect ideal, I'd want to find something that is generally low latency with a small CPU footprint, that isn't too low level and can be thrown together without much fuss, and that, whether built in or through the community, has decent access to libraries for all sorts of desktop related tasks. Bonus points if creating a GUI for it is simple enough, but that's less of a concern.

That said... ignoring for a moment that I already know JavaScript, what language feels like it fits the bill? Or is JavaScript *already* that language, and the only reason I keep seeing Python pop up is because it's similarly suited and much more friendly to work with?",0

I feel like what might be best for my learning style would be to find a tutor/consultant, someone I can sit down with and show my notes on what I want to do and have them tell me if my ideas are realistically something I can learn to do.  Where can I look for such a person?

Best Practice for Storing An Object In Pieces (Wizard),"Hi all. I'm a junior dev and I have been tasked with building a ""wizard"" for an app. 

I'm not sure the best way to store this in the database since the object will be incomplete until the final step, but we want to save progress if they leave the wizard and come back.

I guess my question is: should I use one table for both compete and incomplete objects, and make every column nullable for the fields that haven't been input by the user yet?

Or do I create a separate table for ""incomplete"" objects with these nullable fields?

OR, do I have a separate table for each step of the wizard (step 1, step 2, etc) and combine all the data into the ""canonical"" table of competed objects at the end?

Creating a nodal interface,"I would like to learn about coding a nodal interface, so an interface where you have nodes that do something with the input and output like a function. A situation you see in many places, like Houdini, Nuke etc. 

I would like to make a simple game out of it and would like to see if my way of thinking is correct:

A Node class would have a list of inputs, list of outputs and a list of maps, that connect input and output through a function. Like so

    def Node:
        inputs = [] # tuple (source, type, amount)
        outputs = [] # tuple (type, amount)
        maps = [] # tuple (input, output, function)

One thing I'm struggling with is that I would like nodes to be built from other nodes, so you can open a node, peer inside and find that between it's input and output you have more nodes and I'm not sure how to code it so it makes sense. 

The Node class would handle connecting inputs and calculating the output for every tick of the game. 

Any pointers would be appreciated. ",0
Is nesting conditionals in Reactjsx a bad idea/impossible?,"Hey everyone, I'm curently at the beginning of learning React and I'm coding up a little game.

&#x200B;

Here's a basic rundown of the problem I've encountered:

The game has a ""stopwatch"" that starts at 0 and adds 1 to it every second. The idea is that when the game ends it tells you how long you took and you can attempt to beat your own score.

Then the ""stopwatch"" ends it passes the count to a function that gets the minutes and seconds out of the number and returns an object:  
 {  
minutes: minutes,  
seconds: seconds}

In jsx I am using a ternary to render the result:  
<p>  
It took you{"" ""}  
{parsedTime.minutes === 0  
? \`${parsedTime.seconds } seconds!\`  
: \`${parsedTime.minutes } minutes and ${parsedTime.seconds } seconds!\`}  
</p>

So, if it took less than a minute it's only going to say ""it took you x seconds"" but if it's over a minute it will say ""it took you y minutes and x seconds""

Now, obviously, ""it took you 1 minutes"" doesn't sound good at all, so I was thinking of nesting another conditional under the ""if minutes is bigger than 0"" saying if it's 1, say ""minute"" otherwise ""minutes.

I don't know if nesting ternaries is possible (a google search showed a result saying there is a way but it seems clunky) but I don't know if it's a good/bad practice.

Thoughts on any solutions? Thanks in advance!

Any recommendations regarding the most suitable programming language, as well as insights into potential challenges or risks, would be highly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  


  
Edit:  


Also, it occurred to me that maybe I could grab the data straight from the website instead of using the browser extension. As somewhat of a base... Yeah, now I got unsure of what could be the better path.",0
project oriented programming.. but which language?,"Hello everyone! I'm a complete beginner with a basic question. I'm eager to learn programming with a specific project in mind that I'd like to bring to life.  
I intend to develop an application (for personal use, as I'm exclusively using macOS) for tracking financial data, budgeting, and related tasks. I aim for the program to have a native macOS appearance. However, I'm facing a dilemma: Swift seems to be the right choice for macOS programs, but Python appears to be the best fit for working with finance data.  
Which language should I opt for? My interest in Python extends to other areas like web scraping and data analysis. However, the challenge lies in creating a GUI for my program(s) and the uncertainty about my ability to succeed and potentially upload something to the Apple App Store in the future.  
Thank you for any guidance or advice!",0
What to do after creating web app,"That title sucks, but it makes sense. 

I created a Django web app, that uses a Postgres DB. The gist of this app is tracking jobs and creating invoices for my dad’s company (very small, 3 employees total). He is wanting me to use his company as a Guinea pig and get some projects under my belt. 

My question here, I have the web app running locally. What do I do from here? I have learned what I can about Docker and containerizing this app and what not, but I would really appreciate some help from those who have done this before.  

Another caveat, he is paying $60/month for the software he is using now. Ideally I would love to help him cut that cost if possible.",0
Suggesting Cross-Platform Developing with UI-Designer?,"I want to start a new App for our company, and im not sure yet which Development Environment to choose. 

Is there a way to create Cross-Platform Apps with simple UI Designing tools, which gives you Preview and a Toolbox for Creating UI, like WPF/WinForms in Visual Studio?

Coding Language is not that relevant, for me it would be nice to have a simple UI Designing tool, with Preview and Toolbox.",0
My friend is keep rushing the project.,"Hi, so im currently making a project with my friend for a university assignment. Since we already built some similar projects, we agreed to carry out this project carefully and with the attention to details. Since that time I was carefully learning the 'black box' of how to properly design mongoDB databases, collection and introduce indexes, I've begun to build an api description in openAPI and studied oAuth along the lines to make sure I will learn something out of this project. However my colleague took a different approach, he made a front end in few days with react by watching some tutorials on YouTube and asked me whether I already did the backend endpoint because he wants to test the UI. Of course I could already make some endpoints, it's the matter of few days and carelessly throw all the json documents to the database, but I actually want to know what im doing and read all things through. We have more than 2 months to finish this project and I get that it's comfortable to have the system ready earlier, but in MY opinion we are on the university and I'd like to spend some time to actually learn something new instead of making yet another crappy CRUD app.  


What do you think? Am I in delusion?",0

I'm bad at solving problems,"I'm new to programming and have been attempting InventWithPython.com

I was able to figure out the first few but now when it comes to actually solving a problem I have no idea what to do. 

An example would be the ordinal suffix problem, and I need to check the remainder of certain numbers to determine which suffix to attach. 

The mere *thought* of even doing that was completely over my head. I couldn't figure it out for about 20-30 minutes until I got so frustrated I consulted with ChatGPT for the solution.

Now that I've read over the solution once I delete it without memorizing what needed to be done and attempt it again on my own. This makes me feel like I'm learning but now I'm starting to think it only makes me *feel* like I'm learning without *actually* learning.

Am I shooting myself in the foot here?",0

"Device driver developer, what it means, what to do and seeking some advice how to get started???","Basically, I am in my third year of CS Uni, it is Electrical Engineering majoring in Computer Science (I am from the Balkans, specifically Bosnia and Herzegovina so dunno what to say xd...), as time passes I just cannot get my head around Web development, it is ok and all that, but I personally like a lot more hardware type stuff, we have a subject in University called Architecture and organization of computers, where we learn about MIPS processors, Assembly code, Cache memory, memory in general, parallelism and pipelining and to be honest it is all cool to me. I also liked C and I enjoyed the procedural nature of it. OOP is cool and all that, but I dislike abstraction. Basically, I also have a subject called Operating Systems, where we learn all about Kernels, kernel vs user mode, multithreading, processes, threads and all that and it is also fun, so I am having some career questions and dilemmas. I would like to program drivers or operating systems, probably for Linux as it is most popular, and I asked some people which companies offer these jobs and got this link:  
  
https://www.syrmia.com/expertise-single.php?page=system-software  
  
Basically, this system software part peaked my interest, but I have no idea what to learn, where to go, what to build, I know basic C, like file management, input/output, structs, the basic programming paradigms, loops, arrays, matrices, and I am lost to be honest. I also learned C# and passed the exam well, learned basic OOP and how all of the 4 paradigms of OOP work, have read some stuff on Agile, Scrum, sprints, Waterfall, TDD,BDD and Domain Driven Design, Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Continuous delivery and all that. I also did some HTML and CSS on the side and some JS too, so I am aware of it all and made some small stuff and did some tutorials. Regarding my wishes I dislike automotive and embedded stuff because I do not have money for a Rasberry Pi or an Arduino and I am interested in the hardware parts of just the computer itself, but do not know what to learn or even what the roadmap even is... All I know is i like operating systems and drivers, everything regarding operating systems is cool to me and how it is connected to the hardware of the pc.  
  
Any help or advice regarding this company or firm and what to learn, C or C++ or both, what to build, how to move, anything would help. I think I like this and I would do ok in it.  
  
Thank you all in advance for your replies and God bless!!!",0

I’m trying to build a program! Help with what languages I can learn to execute this!,"So the program I’m planning to build is basically a meal planning program.

I input the recipes I know tagged by its ingredients as a full-database.

On a weekly basis, I place in the ingredients I have at home into the program so that it shows me the food I can make given the recipes.

I select the food that I want to make, and then, if I don’t have an ingredient at home, it creates a grocery list for me!

I found someone creating something similar with Python but without the details of the shopping list.

I was also thinking of translating this into an app so it’s more convenient (so I’ve been told that this should be through Java.)

I’m still in the process of research and am just putting this question up so that I can have second opinions from people as well. :)

Thank you in advance!",0
how to remember things?,"im learning some new languages right now, like C++ and Kotlin, and some things/ actions are hard to memorize

Looking for developers interested in joining a casual group for skill growth and learning.,"I am a professional developer from Canada specializing in full stack Web Development. I am looking to put together a casual group of other professional developers who are interested in both sharing and building skills together. 

For years I had a good group of developers I met through friends and college and we were all focused on building skills and growing as developers. Over time we all got caught up in careers and the group sort of just dissolved as nobody had time. This past year I have realized that as I have had growth in my career I have not had much personal growth as a developer. Recently I have been dedicating more time to working on personal projects, exploring new languages and other aspects of development. The only problem is that I still sometimes lack motivation and it can be a little boring not having other people to learn with or bounce ides off. So with that being said I am looking for other developers who are interested in growing their skills.

Overall I am looking to explore new languages, paradigms and technologies as a whole. Currently I am working through the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises to learn the Rust programming language. I am very interested in growing my knowledge of systems level languages including C, Rust, Zig and Odin as well as exploring functional languages with Lisp, Haskell and OCaml. I have some experience with DevOps but I would really like to grow my DevOps skills also. Currently I have lots of experience with PHP (Laravel) as well as React and Vue. In my current career I work with a team of developers to maintain a legacy ASP application with and Angular frontend.

"Seeking Insights: Java, ASP.NET vs. Python, and GO for Backend Development in Enterprises","Hey everyone,  
I've been diving into the world of backend development and I'm curious about the prevalence of Java and ASP.NET in enterprise applications despite the rise and capabilities of Python. 

Java, in particular, seems to be on a decline in recent years, yet it's still in demand in enterprise world.  
I'm torn between the decision of delving into Java Spring, ASP.NET, or exploring Python with Django for backend development. All these frameworks seem robust and capable of handling large-scale applications, but the differences between them are somewhat blurry to me.  
For instance, Java, ASP.NET, and GO have been the stalwarts in the enterprise world, but Python's versatility and ease of use have gained considerable traction. Is it worth investing time in Java Spring  despite their decline? Or should I pivot towards Python and explore its potential in the backend, especially with frameworks like Django and a plenty of packages available?  
I'd love to hear your experiences and insights on:  
Why do you think Java and ASP.NET are still prevalent in enterprise applications despite their decline?  
   

 Is Java Spring still a viable choice for backend development compared to Python and Django or GO?  


What are the key differences between these frameworks in terms of performance, scalability, and ease of development?  
I believe all these frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses, and the decision might vary based on the project requirements and industry demands. 

Your perspectives, experiences, and suggestions would be immensely helpful in guiding my decision on which path to pursue in backend development.  
Looking forward to a lively discussion and learning from your valuable experiences!",0

Resampling a rectilinear grid to isometric form,"I have a high-resolution rectilinear grid (think of a typical pathfinding grid like [this](https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/), with some cells blocked and some cells free. This is a very high-resolution grid.

I want to resample this grid into a lower-resolution ""isometric"" form- basically, instead of square cells, I want to end up with grid cells like [this](http://angrycoding.github.io/iso-grid-generator/), where the cells have a specific interior angle. The intent is to use this for pathfinding in an environment where paths are constrained to angles other than 90/45, as a rectilinear grid would give you.

Am I wasting my time?,"I'm currently attending a paid program of Full Stack Web Development of 6 months (6 months to 9 months). I joined in the program in July after completing my Higher Secondary Education and now it's been 4 months and still we didn't complete Front end Development yet. The first month the teachers in the company(the company in which I'm currently attending the program) taught us about HTML and CSS. They told us to create unnecessary stuff like Instagram,facebooks..etc logos using CSS and create animations like to do solar system animation using CSS. And only one or two weeks we learned JavaScript. Not even the basics, only like connecting HTML to JavaScript (document.getElementById()) like this things and then after one month we started React.js and then they taught Bootstrap and Tailwind and we started creating ui(like we need to submit minimum 3 ui per day). It's is like very boring to design ui for a person like me who didn't likes designing. And after one and half month creating ui in react using Tailwind and then they started teaching us the concepts in react(Like props, conditional rendering, and useState, useEffect,etc..) and I can't even understand what the mentor is teaching us. And then after like 3 months(In Early November) two new teachers(2 men) came to the company and they asked us to solve a simple array looping question and we were like stuck...... 

We can't even solve a simple JavaScript looping through array Question. And we are now like noobs in javascript after 4 months in a Full Stack Web Development program. And now the management of the company is saying that it was our fault that we didn't learned JavaScript.( How can we learn JavaScript while creating 3 ui per day. And 3 ui must be submitted per day). And now we stopped learning React and the new teachers is saying us to learn the basics of JavaScript. And now I really really confused that ,where to start from and my mind is saying like(You have wasted your 4 months and learned nothing and You didn't have Logical thinking and problem solving skill).

Idk what to do, i seriously love coding and open source projects that's why I chose to learn to code after higher secondary education and without going for a degree. And now I'm stuck with this program.

Someone please tell me what to do and where to start learning JavaScript, i didn't know that much resources to learn JavaScript so that if you know any resources please share with me.🙏

c++ or python for ml and quantitative finance,"as an aspiring computer science major. i have the option at my university to take c++ 1 or python 1 alongside data structures and algorithms.

i understand that python is more widely used for machine learning and quantitative research (which is the area of “quant” i want to partake in). c++ is used more for high frequency trading implementation because of how fast c++ is.

obviously, with the aforementioned information, you would think that python would be the way to go (especially since the second language i want to learn is julia; which shares similarities to python). but since c++ is objectively harder, i feel it would make more sense to bare the burden and run with c++ as it would allow the integration of learning other languages easier than a dynamically typed language like python. 

i also see that the only real reason to choose python over c++ is the difficulty and if that’s the case then i don’t think you should choose something just because it’s easier.

i do understand, however, as someone with barely any coding experience (i can do simple output prints and variables in c++) that i am ignorant. so i would love to pick the brains of those who have went through everything i aforementioned.

 i want reasons to choose python as my first language besides that “it’s easier to learn”.",0

Sales to Sales Engineer,"I’m currently an account executive for a software company. I’m not super technical, but more than the other AE’s. I’d like to eventually move to a programming/dev role.

Disclaimer: my current company doesn’t invest in solution consultants or sales engineers as it isn’t the most technical product and they lean on implementation consultants. Therefore, they wouldn’t pay for me to do the boot camp part time.

How?,"I am not new to programming and am also not relatively good at it. 
This judgement is all because of the code I see other people write online .Like how.How are the writing such complex code.How are they so good at it?Their code always has some kind of #defines and all these complex functions from built in libraries you have never heard from ?
I do understand that to get to that level you would have to put in a lot of had work and practice you would have to be ready to read all these deep books.But seriously how do they even know where to start.Using stuff provided by the language I can't even think of a way to use them.
You see them using namespace, allocating on the heap , casting doing simple stuff in a different way that they say is better for what they are doing

Help With Assembly Tutorial Book,"Hello, I decided that I wanted to learn x86 assembly because it seemed interesting to me (although I'm aware that it's not the best programming language to start with but I've kinda got my mind set on it already), and most places online have said to start with the art of intel x86 book by Randall Hyde (not the HLA version). But I've noticed that it's pretty old and uses MS-DOS for most parts so I'm a bit confused on some things.

It says to modify some lines from an AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that MASM will be able to locate and include files from the UCR standard library zip I downloaded, but I am using FASM instead and well, there's no AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

So I'm just wondering if there's a way to let FASM include the files from the UCR standard library so I can follow along with the tutorial properly?

Assignment Bot Python,"Hi, I'm currently working on an assignment, but I just cannot figure out how to solve it. It is basically the fundamentals of programming. However I didn't have much time to work on it. I tried using ChatGPT 4, and he was helping me out a little, but couldn't solve it completely.

What the assignment is about:

I'm supposed to write a code for a bot that is able to collect all the '@' on multiple maps. the map is most often 30x30 with walls being 'X', all around the map (so the first row & last row, the first collumn & last collumn). Also, there are obstacles, also being X, but within the map.

To receive a good grade, I'm supposed to write a code that is able to solve all maps, and the beginner maps faster than the example Bot in the easy maps. I have already done a few things to be able to go faster in the easy maps. However, I'm getting stuck at the end of the map. I'm currently doing a zig-zag method with priority on going to the @, but if I'm at the bottom, I'm unable to go back up. I hope someone can help me write a good code that is able to go back up. (I asked chatgpt4 but these codes just didn't work...)

I will provide a link which will direct you to the codes of the game, the code of the map,  examples of a map, code of app and bot, and the code of my bot, which is TryoutBot.

hope some of you can help me out. I think the assignment is really fun, but I'm currently stuck for too long now...

\*\* To run the game\*\*

you have to put the right map in the app settings in order to run the map

you can start the game in terminal by saying python app.py  (you'll probably know already how to do it haha)

\*\*\*Important rules\*\*\*

You can only go left right up down

The bot is allowed to remember where it already went

No spawning

Thinking of going back to home country and study again or continue in Japan in Web Development,"Hi good afternoon to everyone,  
I lived in Japan for 4 years (language school and Junior College), worked for 7 months in a company related to video shooting and last year in September after leaving the job, I decided to go back to my home country (Spain) with my now wife (Japanese), to stay sometime with my family.While working in Japan, I started to study a little bit of web development (HTML and CSS).  


When I stayed in Spain I continued self-studying web development, and I was supposed to go to school to study Web Development (Junior College). But before enrolling I applied for some jobs related to IT(システムエンジニア) in Japan, and as I got 3 offers I decided to go back to Japan and see if could do the job.  


Fast-forward 7 months and I am working in a company as a システムエンジニア but without doing anything related (Translating documents from Japanese to English / Spanish, writing blog entries in the company's website, preparing the Meishi cards for the employers and writing some Powerpoints and excel files).  
I wanted to work in IT or in a job related to programming but, without any certification and no job experience programming (because although my job position says システムエンジニア, all I do is office related tasks), I wanted to ask the people of reddit if it would be better for me to go back to my home country and try again to go to school and get some certifications or If I try changing the job would give me any chance to find a real IT related work.  


Background: 26 years old Male (Spanish), married to Japanese spouse with a Junior College degree in Media Studies and a Bachelor Degree in International Business.

"Are the Spring MVC Sections of Chad Darby's Spring Udemy Course, which feature Thymeleaf, Worth Learning?","Basically the title. So I'm a student who's about to do internships in a few months and I started learning Spring one month ago.  
  
I puchased the course and saw these three sections related to the use of Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. After some googling it seems like Spring MVC is worth learning but Thymeleaf is not. I also watched some of the videos from the sections and if I'm not mistaken, Chad just redid what he had done in the previous sections with Thymeleaf in Spring MVC? For example he created lots of lectures on how to create buttons, how to validate forms and so on.  
  
  
  
I'm so confused now, in your opinion, are these sections worth learning? Because lots of these lectures seem to be focused on building the front-end part of the application with Thymeleaf, which is an obsolete technology. And also these three sections (Spring MVC, Spring MVC CRUD and Spring MVC Security) seem to just repeat what he said in the previous sections (REST API Security, REST CRUD APIs and Hibernate/JPA CRUD)  


So I'm wondering, should I skip these three sections? What's the relationship between Springboot and Spring MVC? Why did Chad redo those sections?

  
Could someone kindly help me please? Thanks!!

Help me Improve my learning process,"I've been studying Next.js now but there is really something wrong with me when I am starting to learn new languages. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. 

  
Here are the things that I've done to learn new languages: 

&#x200B;

1. Watching YouTube videos - but really I am not a person who will watch a 9 hours long video from YouTube especially if its a tutorial for a new programming languages. Why? Because since I can see the hours that I have to spend watching it. It feels like its a waste of time
2. After getting bored I will just read the documentation, I get it when I am reading a documentation. But there are times that I don't simply understand it because some of the documentation is not really complete or easy to read some do not even have context.
3. I rely on Chat GPT when there is something from the documentation that I don't undetstand
4. I code, and when I encounter errors instead of asking the Stackoverflow I rely on Chat GPT. But can you blame me? When I was starting programming 4 years ago, I started asking questions in there but all I get is a sarcastic response from the oh-so-called ""Senior"" on the field. Sometimes their replies are mostly rude and arrogant, so I stopped posting there and I somehow became a kind of spectator on the platform whenever I had questions (I will find the same problem that I have there and read some solutions)

If you can help me to improve my learning patterns or if you have any advice when learning new languages, I appreciate it. I have had this problem from the beginning so any advice on how to improve learning programming languages will be nice. Also, I learn how to program at school and because of that I have this behaviour of asking my teacher when I have a problem with my code that I became dependent on them, but really I wanted to become dependent on myself and the internet and its resources.

        ""self"": {
          ""href"": ""http://localhost/api/v3/responses?with[0]=users&with[1]=vacancies""

Now I want the response to have this structure:

    {
      ""_total_items"": 20,
      ""_links"": {
        ""self"": {
          ""href"": ""http://localhost/api/v3/responses?with[0]=users&with[1]=vacancies""

          },
          {
            ""id"": 2,
            ""vacancy_id"": 6,

        ],
        ""vacancies"": [
          {
            ""id"": 5,
            ""name"": ""Vacancy 5"",
            ""status"": ""opened""
          },
          {
            ""id"": 6,
            ""name"": ""Vacancy 6"",
            ""status"": ""closed""
          }
        ],
        ""users"": [
          {
            ""id"": 11,
            ""username"": ""joe""
          },
          {

            ""username"": ""frank""
          }
        ]
      }
    }

So I can have two extra keys in \_embedded, keeping pagination of initial collection. How do I do this with Eloquent Collection?

Also, \`concat\` collection method gives me another mezzio-hal error, saying it's structure is not correct, and also it doesn't groups my collections, just pushing them right after responses.",0

How much front-end work is involved in the workflow of a full-stack developer?,"I have started my self learning journey last year like in mid-November 2022. So almost a year doing regular practice during my weekends and holidays. I started learning with C, C++ and basic concepts of C#. I am currently learning HTML and CSS wishing to learn the full-stack with react and node and some js frameworks. But to my surprise I find myself adept in back-end stacks more than front-end. Haven't started JavaScript yet. Looking start with ES6 and then find my way from there. Why I said I am not good in front is because I find it very confusing as to why somethings should be how they are and why do we need so many things happening in the screen. Also I find myself trouble with placing certain layout or positioning and sizes and color options. Whereas I can find myself coding for hours in one sitting and forget everything around me and just listen to music. What should I do to get better at front-end and also like the work. Why am I trying or forcing myself  to full-stack? I don't know. Maybe because I already know that full-stack exists and I want to learn ins and outs of the web development.

I believe that with each passing day it will become more difficult to make money with the internet, if you are sitting there, if you want to make money with the internet today, all you have to do is do a project and start and dedicate yourself and it will probably work, today 2023. But I believe that in the near future this will no longer work, I believe that internal policies, as well as EXTERNAL ones, have influenced the earning of money on the internet, I believe that in the next 20 years all the income that people earn on the internet will be extinguished by around 80%. or more.  
And this has nothing to do with the current policy of most governments, this has to do with a much bigger macro than that.

ChatGPT as a programming assistant/teacher,"I have been learning C++ for a while mostly with a book, reference sites and google searches (in this order) and ChatGPT has also been handy at times.

But recently i have questioned myself why the hell vectors and strings need an header but arrays don't, cause according to my book they don't and code compiles fine without it.

So i was asking ChatGPT first to give me an overview of arrays in C++, then i asked ""do i need to include a specific header?"" and the first sentence of the reply was ""In C++, you don't necessarily need to include a specific header for basic array usage, as the array syntax itself is part of the core language features. ""

Not really convinced with both the lack of reference to an header for arrays in my book and the explanation of ChatGPT i asked in a new chat: ""in c++ , why strings need a header and arrays don't?"" and the reply was: ""In C++, both strings and arrays have their respective headers that you need to include if you want to use them in your code. Arrays are a fundamental part of the C++ language, and their functionality is included in the <array>, <vector>, and <algorithm> headers, among others, depending on the type of array you are using.

Seeking Advice: Bootcamp or Self-Teaching?,"
I find myself at a crossroads, and I could really use your expertise and guidance. I have an associates degree in graphic design and have obtained a few certificates in free programs to broaden my skill set. However, I'm now contemplating whether I should pursue a bootcamp or continue self-teaching to further advance my career. I’m also a business owner and working full-time. So time is a consideration.

Those of you who have experience with bootcamps or self-teaching, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Here are a few specific questions I have:

1. Are bootcamps worth the investment? I’ve read so many differing opinions on here!
2. What advantages does self-teaching offer over a bootcamp, and vice versa?
3. Have any of you made the transition from a graphic design background to a bootcamp or self-teaching?
4. Are there any particular bootcamps or self-teaching resources you would recommend?

Wanted to see if ya all thought this is a good plan that is being executed to be an Experienced Senior Management Software Engineer in 10-15 years?,"The Plan I've Been Doing:

1st. Pursuing Medical Coder Certification in AAPC and/or AHIMA (Different online schoolings to be a Certified Medical Coder, Biller, and Health Records Technician since it'll take time to become a Junior/ Senior/ Manager/ Supervisor Cloud Software Engineer and because it'll be one of many unique things to set me apart once I'm job hunting)

2nd. Doing all of these for Software Engineer:

* The Odin Project
* freecodecamp.org
* A Pre-Apprenticeship I'm doing to hopefully get a Paid Apprenticeship
* Practicing as many hours as I can each day
* Looking into Open Source Projects to contribute to (Linux/ Godot/ Open Source Games)
* Reverse engineering job postings to add on to and improve my current plan with what to learn overtime

3rd. Any online communities ya all would recommend for me to join to review my code with? Also, tips to find in-person communities too?

4th. When I'm able to financially will do a Bachelor's from Western Governors University Online & Masters for Business Management (To give extra distinction from other Junior Engineers)

Ideally I would like to have a main job as a Principal Software Engineer Manager in future (Cloud) and a Side Job/ Passion project of contributing to Linux, Godot, and making my own Indie Game on Godot. Then overtime with seniority making my own Open Source Community to add onto what's currently already there and expanding what Open Source can be (Have a few things in mind already)

Is this a solid plan, and anything ya all would recommend? Please and thank you!",0

"Learning Java in college, assignments tell me I haven't done correctly when I've fully completed them, can anyone help?","As the title states, I've been trying to do some of my programming assignments for college. We use a site called Cengage, as it has all of our books online with assignments attached. For Programming assignments they'll give you instructions and specific tasks you must complete in order for that assignment to be turned in. For several of these assignments, I've been unable to submit them, it marks the tasks as incomplete despite the fact that I have completed them all. My professor has also attached tutorial videos to each of the assignments, using the same site. I have followed along with them in full several times and still get the same results.

For example, the exercise that I am currently working on, Unit 2: 2-4, tasks me with writing a program named ""QuartsToGallons"" that declares a named constant (QUARTS\_IN\_GALLON) to hold the number of quarts in a gallon (4).  The work I have in this section is as follows:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Code learning doubts,"Hello everyone, first time here.
I’m currently studying swift and I’m starting to have some doubts on the choice of learning this language. Premised that is my first language (I know little of Java script and gen~)  and im currently 20% in the course and so far I like it,  I’m starting to think is not what I wanted to do or better I love learning something new but I’m trying to learn it also in a professional point of view (so maybe find a job on the field in the future)

Now I have 2 friends both with academic degrees in computer science that suggested me to anyway keep doing this eventually end the course and move to learn properly Java Script, css, html, and eventually c++ later on. Should I keep finishing the course I’m doing (is a career path on code academy) or should I start maybe already with react native and dive into Java script, I’m afraid would be too much informations and notions at once.",0
Is it just me or are developers bad at usability/UX design in their own tools?,"I guess this isn't strictly a programming question, but it's something I've noticed for years before I started actually learning programming and has really struck me the more I've learned.

Some examples:

1) IDE/compiler setup: I remember seeing a post on here recently on this, where someone who taking a class was struggling even to properly install Java. I had similar struggles myself trying to get everything set up properly to use C++ with Visual Studio Code. I grew up on MS-DOS so terminal stuff isn't totally alien to me, but I can imagine it feels pretty overwhelming to anyone coming to it the first time. It just kinda surprised me that you can just run an .exe to install like Photoshop or some cutting edge 3D game, but there's not really a ""simple"" solution where someone can run a file and then start writing code. I assume some of this has to do with setting up a Linux-based thing on Windows, but still.

2) Github and modder readmes: This is a similar problem across multiple areas. I first noticed it years ago when trying to install Minecraft mods for my kid. I've noticed it with mods for other games too (at least those not from Steam Workshop). The documentation is fucking awful, disorganized and obtuse half the time, and I don't know how people who don't have a background in general ""computer stuff"" can parse it. I'm not expecting it to be like professional level.

I've especially noticed this when looking into AI stuff on github. Most of the projects I've found just read like gibberish if you don't already know all the AI jargon and buzzwords. I get that a lot of these things are directed at other developers, but sometimes someone on Reddit will say: ""Oh, go install this thing from this repo"" and nothing really clearly even explains what the things \*does\* or what it's use cases are.

3) SQL Workbench: Minor point, but I'm taking a database class at the same time and like... SQL is pretty straightforward but how is Workbench so ugly and unintuitive? Like it's just feels unpleasant to work with. What feels like obvious context-sensitive prompts aren't used intuitively and key operations are buried 3 tabs deep in some side panel.

It's just weird to me, even when I'm doing labs for a CS class I usually try and build some kind of simple menu or something so the professor doesn't have to figure out how to use my program before using it to grade the assignment. I feel like we get usability drilled into our heads early on in CS classes but it gets completely abandoned.",0

"How do I completely uninstall Visual Studio Code, Mingw64 and Dev-C++?

Should I worry about this?","I’m starting learning programming completely from scratch (that is to say, I know nothing about programming and computers). I’m worried that some subtle fault in the installation of these things might cause problems down the line that leave me scratching my head.  
  
As somebody who’s helped some people out who didn’t have the best Mathematics teachers, I feel that one of the worst things that can happen is when somebody is correct but are told they are incorrect. I fear that this might happen to me in programming years from now in some case where I write correct code that does not work due to a fault in the installation. Then I might wind up “learning” falsehoods.  
  
I thought I’d completely uninstall everything and then do a re-install but I’m afraid of what might happen if I miss some things when uninstalling and that they might affect the follow up installation process.  
  
So far I’ve run “hello world” and a simple code summing up two numbers. Both work but if I run them while my antivirus is on they take a long time as the antivirus gives me a “suspicious file detected” notification and scans the file before declaring it’s OK. When I run them with anti-virus (Avast free version) disabled they run much faster. This increases my concern as it is an example of my anti-virus being annoying. As has probably been the case for most, I have had a few cases of software not running in the past until I turned disabled the anti-virus  
  
On Visual Studio Code I also installed the following extensions:  
C/C++ and Code Runner.  
I’m wondering on how to uninstall those as well.

Recreational app dev,"I have an idea and would like to write a cross platform app for it. This is more of a fun and hobby project for me.

What I learnt is recreational although I do work in the tech field and keep up with reading the latest stuff and playing around to the point where I can intelligently discuss. 

Based on my readings, looks like my options are: 

React Native - steep learning curve. But most bang for the buck.

Flutter: clunky but possibly may be quicker. Possible performance issues although my app is fairly simple. Also Google. Who knows when they’ll have a fit and dump Flutter. 

Low code/no code: Bubble/Noodl etc. possibly quick but tied to vendor. Also may end up paying hefty fees. But good for a first round workable POC. Although, i doubt learning it will be easier. I’ve seen many trends come and go so am skeptical of any tall claims.

Storing data from a JSON response in one variable to be used in a second API call?,"Long story short, my company uses an SAAS platform that's designed for an operation a lot smaller. It doesn't come with a lot of bulk actions that we need to use, which forces me and other team members to use a lot of manual work.

Fortunately, the software has an Open API which leaves a lot of room to manipulate this data via Javascript

I can perform basic calls, but to do what I'm trying to do, which is actually remove data in bulk, I need to actually take the data from one call, store object ID's, and then make a second call with those object keys to delete them. Ideally, I'd be able to do this with multiple object types, so say:

Get object 1 Ids -> Delete object 1 id's -> get object 2 id's -> delete object 2 id's

Here's what I tried building myself:

&#x200B;

    const options = {
    
    method: 'GET',
    
    headers: {
    
    accept: 'application/json',
    
    Authorization: 'bearer '
    
    }
    
    };
    
    async function getResourcesAndDelete(endpoints) {
    
    const baseUrl = ''; // Replace with your API base URL
    
    try {
    
    for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
    
    // Fetch resource data
    
    const response = await fetch(\${baseUrl}/${endpoint}`);`
    
    if (!response.ok) {
    
    throw new Error(\Failed to fetch ${baseUrl}/${endpoint}. Status code: 
    ${response.status}`);`
    
    }
    
    const resourceData = await response.json();
    
    // Delete resource
    
    const deleteResponse = await fetch(\${baseUrl}/${endpoint}`, {`
    
    method: 'DELETE',
    
    headers: {
    
    'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Adjust content type if needed
    
    // Add any other headers required for authentication or other purposes
    
    },
    
    // If you need to send data in the delete request, you can use the body option
    
    // body: JSON.stringify({ /* data to send */ }),
    
    });
    
    if (deleteResponse.ok) {
    
    console.log(\Delete request to ${baseUrl}/${endpoint} successful`);`
    
    } else {
    
    console.error(\Failed to delete ${baseUrl}/${endpoint}. Status code: 
    ${deleteResponse.status}`);`
    
    console.error(await deleteResponse.text());
    
    }
    
    }
    
    } catch (error) {
    
    console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
    
    }
    
    }
    
    // Example usage:
    
    const endpointsToDelete = ['api/'];
    
    getResourcesAndDelete(endpointsToDelete);

I omitted the endpoints just because I want to stay anomymous and I don't want my company to find me here.

The response I get is ""An error occurred: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0""

To be honest, I think I'm completely off the rails with this code and don't even know where to begin to fix it. I would have thought that this was a common use case for API calls, but oddly enough I can't seem to find any tutorials or github repos that really nail exactly how to grab data from the JSON response of an API, and then store it in a variable to be used for another request.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'll honor you forever. In your darkest hour, I will return and save you somehow by making an api call to bulk remove data from an SAAS platform.",0

Can it be said that DAO or data access object is a way to implement ORM?,"ORM and DAO have similar goals, but one is a programming technique and the other is, an object that does essentially the job of an ORM tool.

>ORM’s function is to map the data represented in an object-oriented form to the database. DAO (Data Access Object) and DTO (Data Transfer Object) patterns are used in Object Relational Mapping. DAO acts as a bridge between the database and the application.

I'm just trying to understand what the relationship is exactly between these two concepts as I learned about them recently and they're still abstract in my head. I may update this post with relevant info when I learn more.

I'm curious about where and when were ORM and DAO defined, or rather conceptualized since Wikipedia would cite the sources if there was some concrete definition somewhere. The following are two relevant sources I haven't gotten to yet:

Considering a masters degree in computer science with no prior experience,"I took a UG degree in English and will complete it next year, but I'm noticing I don't have any chances to secure higher paying jobs or the opportunity to even leave the country (Hong Kong), which is something I'd like to do at some point in my life. I have no prior experience with computer science besides extremely basic Python and using Microsoft programs during an internship that I had, but the employability and money aspect of CS is extremely alluring. I have several friends in computer science and they don't seem to have much to worry about besides the complexity of the course, which would be my biggest concern.

There are masters degrees for people with no prior CS experience and I've asked a friend who did CS in undergrad, she suggested I may need to establish a repo that is good enough to override a low GPA, then eat sleep and breathe math in a gap year before being able to apply, as an A level in math would probably be the way to show that my math ability is competent. I haven't done any math in 3 years since high school besides doing a little bit of it for my geography minor (which I found extremely difficult because I lack a solid foundation in basic concepts). She believes I'm capable of catching up to an acceptable level but warns me that it will be extremely stressful because of the concept complexity, especially because I'm not the most adept at math. I don't think I'm naturally horrible at it, mostly that I struggle with significant math anxiety from previous trauma growing up. I'm as good as anyone else with practice however. She also took it upon herself to teach me some python which she said I picked up faster than some of her peers and she's quite blunt to be fair, but I wouldn't know how true that is at the end of the day.

That being said I took math studies in the IB diploma (considered to technically be the lowest level of math you can do, mostly statistics). A 5/7 in math studies does not look very good at all and is what I received, but I have also have an A in IGCSE higher tier math. I was never good at it, I only got it because I prepared for that exam four years in advance. I imagine an A in IGCSE higher tier isn't too bad though?

It's not something I'm totally passionate in, I have a love hate relationship with math. I can see why it would be interesting but I've had a lot of poor experiences with it. Again though, the money is insanely attractive and I'm in a quarter life crisis where I am desperate to secure as many opportunities as possible. So should I try to apply for a CS masters?",0
Compiled code stored in folder after running?,"[https://imgur.com/a/UlxGXHv](https://imgur.com/a/UlxGXHv)

Whenever I run C++ code in VSCode it saves the .cpp file alongside a terminal file which I assume is the compiled code. Whenever I open the terminal file it just runs normally how it would run inside the VSCode terminal.

How can I stop these files from showing in my folders and making them cluttered?

Practicing programming help,"Hi, i'm new to this sub and Reddit in general. My problem is as follows. I’m a college student of CS, aprox third year and I consider myself experimented/medium/advanced programmer(somewhere in between). I am no newbie but recently I had an exam where we had to write code on paper and write a C program of Sparse matrix. The thing is, during the test I noticed how I lacked some logic and it was freakingly hard for me to picture and imagine the code. So I asked a friend to give me tips and he borrowed me a book of competitive programming that has a lot of exercises and tips to improve skills on a competitive level. This book is great and has a lot of support. It uses exercises from UVA online judge and even though i've done some very good, there are some other problems categorized ""easy"" and can't even work around any solution. I want to know if this is normal and if there are any other online judges that you guys would recommend for a guy with my level.

Can someone give me a beginner rundown of what exactly the code is doing here (CS50 week 1),"https://prnt.sc/ZZtUruVJ05EX

The end result of the code is to end up with this shape (with hashtags instead of O's, reddit wont let me use hashtags);

OOO

OOO

OOO

but I'm struggling to grasp some of the code, I know n is set to constantly be 3, i is set to repeat itself until i is equal to n, but I'm confused by j, what exactly is j?

He explained it at some point in the video but I'm struggling to grasp everything being explained, I think my biggest problems are I don't understand what exactly j is and what order the code is being run in since it has 2 loops together

Edit: Am I right in thinking that the code is being run from the inside out? so j is set to type O until it has been typed 3 times, then it cuts to the \n, once that happens that bit of code is marked as having run once so i changes from 0 to 1, then it runs the code again and goes to a new line and i changes from 1 to 2, then again and i changes from 2 to 3?",0
How to get started on my dev journey for my situation,"Hello, I'm not that good at explaining things but I'll give it a try, sorry in advance if it was a bad explanation.I'm 27 turning 28 in couple of months. I have social anxiety and depression; however it's getting better in my opinion. I've been feeling better lately and have been able to talk to others without being too anxious. I was going to university couple of years ago for game design, however I ended up dropped out. I have no degree and still live with my parents.

I have dabbled in programming on and off over the years and have enjoyed it. Looking back, I mostly regret all the time I ended up wasting away. Lately I've been thinking that I need to start to change my life for the better starting now rather than being stuck in the past. I've decided to focus on learning programming properly to try to get a dev job, it's one of the things I've enjoyed from what I've done (Discord bots, code academy, Udemy courses, small projects, etc.).

Over the years I've done a bunch of tutorials/courses for front end web development however I always end up switching between them and never going deep into the subject which I'm trying to not do anymore.

I wanted to ask if it's worth going back to college for a cs degree at this age, should I go with a boot camp or be self-taught. Either way, it would be great if I could get a path of some sort that I could follow and expected time to learn the subject.Preferably for full stack development but I haven't really explored any of the other avenues. Maybe some good resources to brush up on mathematics too.I've started the odin project but haven't gotten that far yet, I also wanted to ask if I should stick with it or switch to freecodecamp or CS50 instead.

Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post, I didn't think it'd be this long 😆

TL;DR: Battling mental health struggles, I want to transform my life, learning programming properly being one of the steps to try to get a dev job. Contemplating a CS degree, bootcamp, or self-taught path for full-stack development. Need advice on learning structure, time commitment, and maybe math resources. Started with The Odin Project, considering switching to freeCodeCamp or CS50. Open to any learning suggestions.

"Spring, JPA & Hibernate: Querying DTO with a list of entities","I am working on a Spring project with hibernate & JPA. For the sake of this question I will rename the entities and change the queries accordingly, but it does not change the context.

We have an entity, let's call it a House. In almost all scenarios we do not need the whole House entity, so we made the queries in the HouseRepository returning HouseDtos instead of Houses in the following way ([as it is a recommended practice](https://twitter.com/vlad_mihalcea/status/1207887006883340288?lang=en)):

        @Query(value = """"""
            SELECT new project.house.HouseResponseDto(
            h.id,
                h.owner,
            h.address,
                h.review
            ) FROM House
            WHERE h.address= :address
            """"""
    )
    List<HouseResponseDto> getAllHouseByAddress(@Param(""address"") String address);

Now we are introducing changes to the House entity, where in the DB, it will no longer hold a Review. Instead, we have a Review table, where each Review has a house\_id foreign key that references house.id. On the House entity, we have the following changes:

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""houseId"") u/ElementCollection(targetClass = Review.class)
     private List<Review> reviews;

The best idea I could come up with for the new queries,that we use JOIN COLUMN to fetch a House entity with all it's Review entities mapped to it's reviews List, it is working fine:

     @Query(value = """"""
            SELECT h FROM House h
                JOIN FETCH h.reviews reviews
            WHERE h.address= :address
            """"""
    )
    List<HouseResponseDto> getAllHouseByAddress(@Param(""address"") String address);

The problem is, that now we have to convert House entities to HouseDTOs in every service layer method that is really cost ineffective. I believe I could make multiple queries: one for fetching Houses and one for fetching related Reviews but that also does not seem so effective when the query returns a list of houses.

Is there any way to keep fetching DTOs without making multiple queries? I am really over my head - and really over time i''ve got to refacor ""House"" on the project. Any ideas? Thanks!",0

I've tried googling and can't find many other threads asking for help, the only couple I found at least had some ideas of how to do it but I just can't figure this out. 

This is the prompt: 

Write a program to play a numbers guessing game. The user thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and your program asks questions to figure out what the number is (e.g., “Is the number you are thinking of less than 50?”). Your program should be able to identify the number after asking no more than seven questions. Hint: Use the < and <= operators and the if-else construct.

I cannot figure how to do this in seven questions whatsoever, or how to do this without an endless amount of nested if statements. I've tried doing it with a loop and just get completely stuck. I've spent hours and hours trying to figure this out and I'm stumped. This is making me seriously question my ability to reason, this probably shouldn't be that hard.

all this async is ass!,"I never have a need for async in the work I do. its riddled throughout our libraries now.

You have to cheat and just add .Result(). to everything. Such a waste of time whoever thought this was a good idea primarily because: **The whole thread should always be a background thread anyway**. The mistake is to assume you are running on a main UI thread which is a stupid thing to do. So this modern pattern solved the problems backwards. And made it complicated to appease shitty javascript which is forced to run on a main UI thread. These async guys should have told javascript to become multithreaded and we would have not had to use async ever again.

basically, syncronous calls inside a background thread (good,clean) > async calls inside a main thread (dumb,messy)

Since we all have almost memorized that time complexity of nested for loop is O(n^2), it might be obvious for many.

But if you look closely, this is what happens here:

For i=1, j goes 1 times

For i=2, j iterates 2 times


So for i=n, j iterates i times.

Complexity of inner loop=1+2+3+...+n=n(n+1)/2

Complexity of outer loop=n


Total TC=O(n^3).

Java final prep,"I have a Java final in 2 and a half weeks, the syllabus? Well all first-year Java concepts. The multiple choice questions are worth 2 marks. There will be 3 sections, the first section is all multiple choice. The multiple choice questions are worth 2 marks. It will cover mostly every topic. The second section is short programming. (I have to write short code). The third section is long. I have to write a full program from start to finish. How do I prepare for this final effectively from start to finish. Also how would I have to prepare for the lengthy programming ones, I know regular practice will help but I don’t know how to prepare for the loaded multiple choice questions and the long programming questions at the same time .

I love to create and see tech as stable for the future,"I'm brand new in coding. I've dabbled a few times and never got far but rn I'm on week 4 learning html. I really love it, and am constantly flipping between doing courses and creating my own little projects for fun. I really enjoy watching my text come alive!

I started this because I'm recently unemployed and my wife has taken the reigns financially. I'm going to find something to pull in money in the meantime, but down the road I want to take these coding skills somewhere. 

My big questions for you are:

Where do you see programming going in the future, and are the areas that I should focus more or less on if I want to be successful in this constantly changing world?

I've read quite a bit that learning the fundamentals is important but that nobody memorizes everything. I have trouble often remembering how to space properly or have a color stretch across a header without having outside space or taking up the whole page. Do you have recommendations or techniques for remembering/easily recalling code? 

My focus is web-dev currently, but I'm an avid learner and aspire to soak up as much info as I can. What are the hot markets in tech that a nobody with no degree can learn?",0

Go REST API design,"I just wrote my first REST API in GO. Its a basic CRUD app with endpoints that accept/serve serialized JSON from a MySQL DB. 

The good news is it works! I deployed it to my VPS and I can fetch the data from a basic frontend client.

But I want to make my API more robust and follow best practices, so I'm considering some refactoring. I will probably rewrite the whole thing again but utilizing a Postgres DB.

In my initial build, I utilized gOrm to abstract out the SQL portion of the API.

So my question is, would you consider it best practice to write out your own SQL Queries for an API endpoint like this? Or is utilizing the ORM package efficient enough? 

I am relatively new to Go but I have worked with ORMS in the past (SQLalchemy, Django, springboot/hibernate) but I dunno the general sentiment around gORM",0
Javascript gives me anxiety.,"I have been learning Javascript in me own and I completed a Javascript tutorial that covers the basics of Javascript. I know about arrays, data types, functions, basic DOM, Event handlers, loops, if statements.

I get anxiety when I realize there is more that I still have to learn and I'm afraid I won't master them due to lack of good learning materials. I learn through tutorials and not reading books. 

Javascript concepts like using APIs, Async, promises, await honestly give me anxiety.

The fact that there is too much that I need to learn still gives me anxiety. How do I go about it.

PROFESSIONAL OR ANYONE WHO REGARDS AS I CAN CODE PERSON. PLEASE ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BELOW TO GUIDE SBD WHO INTO THIS FOR LESS THAN 3 MONTHS.,"**ABOUT ME:** I don't want to spend my next few months or years lying to myself that I'm ok even though I'm not. My approach to studying at uni is just not acceptable. I don't have enough time to look at the materials and **enough time to work through the tasks** before the due days. TBH, I started coding from 8AM to late night. Yet nothing satisfy me. Since I feel like I am not approaching programming at uni the right way and I don't improve. I spent too much time look at the screen in blank, and then worn myself out. At the end, I still can't be able to code on my own. My problem is that I don't have enough time (limited by my school deadline, once I mastered sth, that part already passed and I had got a low score). 

**MY PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS:**  
1. ***How to approach a piece of knowledge?*** For example, how to use read a file into the computer,  or Selection Sort and OOP in general. However, I am later forget how to use that knowledge (which everyone might unless they're a computer). So I wonder, **should I take notes to remember it, or should I looked it up google again and again.** 

  
2. Then I think about whether my approach to ***searching using google*** was good enough. **What is your way of searching for a methods and how to use it most efficiently.** Because apparently, most of them are questions on StackOverFlow if not then from W3Schools, or even reddit. But having spent time looking into the questioners and then read for short solutions is really daunting as many approach was proposed and I wonder which one should I be looking at. 

3.  **What is your tips on approaching a task?** 

>How do you read a task requirements while coding along with it?  
>  
>Do you read the task and then remember the requirements, then started to code?

I really hope to see your approach in solving a problems. <Do u plan out, write out, what would you write down>

4. **After finishing a problems, what is your tips of covering the new pieces of information so that you won't forget it?**

>Do you jot down the piece of knowledge?  
>  
>Do you skip it aside and look it up later?

5. **What is your tips on approaching a task but this time I don't understand and don't remember the methods, or the informations (anything) mention in the task and the provided code?** 

*I usually got stuck when I first read a task, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to think? As I read further I feel lost since I haven't make out the aforementioned requirements yet get into more unknown keywords and methods.* 

6. When I can't solve a question, and have to give up, it leaves me to the last resort that I search for an answer. For a certain, I will see that the task is solvable as soon as I read the answer. So I either skip and simply read it through. **I wonder, what to do after you see an approach/solution to the problems? Would you redo the same, or do it another way.**

does anyone know how to solve this?,"You are given an input string that controls the
movement of a robot, ""F"" means take a step
forward, ""L"" means turn 90 degrees to the left*
and ""R"" means turn 90 degrees to the right. E.g.
""FLF"" moves the robot one step forward, then
turns it left by 90 degrees, then moves the robot
one step forward. Write a function that returns
the minimum number of commands that the
robot needs to return to its starting point
after following all the input commands. You
should ignore any characters that are not
capital F, L, or R. Hint: you may wish to track
the robot's position using (X,Y) coordinates,
assuming it starts at (0,0
For example:
• ""RF"" returns 3 (robot must turn twice and
move forward one step (eg. ""RRF"")
•""LFRFRFR"" returns 1 (robot must step
forward to return)
• ""FxLXLXF×"" returns 0 (robot is already back at starting point)

I don't understand how to organize stuff in an HTML resume.,"Hey guys!  
First of all, English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if I use terms which aren't the good ones.

What to do With a Side Project After Completing It?,"Hi everyone, I graduated college in may with a major in Business Information Technology with a concentration in cybersecurity (it sounds like a technical degree but I don’t actually feel confident with any cyber concepts, and I have a baseline understanding of programming and data analysis - but it definitely wasn’t a computer science degree). I have a job lined up to start in January, but it’s not super technical. I’ll be doing IT audits which I know I won’t want to do for long. I’d much rather be in a more technical role. 

In the meantime I’ve taken advice from here and r/learnpython and have started working on a project to actually improve/solidify my programming skills. It’s a data visualization tool/app built with Plotly Dash with a major custom component in react.js which uses vis.js. The project has become much larger than I expected it to be and it’s something I’d like to actually publish as a website. 

My questions come from two things. First, considering this was just a project to improve my “portfolio,” should I publish this as a website, or just post it on my GitHub? What would recruiters like to see more? I feel like GitHub allows them to see how I built it, but I also want them to use it without having to clone a repo. 

This next question kind of comes from my mom (lol) - she’s very adamant about me “protecting my intellectual property” which I completely understand where she’s coming from. If I were to go ahead and publish this app as a site, how do I go about protecting it/my code? And what else should I keep in mind while publishing it?

Thanks for any input. 

TL:DR - I built and project I’m very proud of. Now what?",0

Counter not working for D-flip flops,"I have to do an assignment where I take a clock divider, then I have to display 11 states at a certain frequency. I made a finite state machine with 4 d-flip flops and I derived the formulas for the next 11 states, with the formulas

D3=q3\*!q2\*!q1+!q3\*q2\*q1\*q0. I have confirmed with  K-map solvers online that these formulas for the 11 states for the finite state machine are correct.   
. I use this as a counter to advance to the 11 states, which then goes into the decoder to take each bit as output. For D0, D1 it cycles through. Whenever I. Get to D2 for some reason it does not advance to D2. Despite all my efforts to do so. I have spent hours on this. Either I used this formula or a K-map correct formula from an internet K-map solver.   
I have an assignment  for class with different numbers and letters that are to be displayed using a seven segment display. In total there are 11 states each should be displayed using a different bit, and it should go at 1 Hz then cycle through. I made a clock divider, then a finite state machine diagram for the next state, where each of the formulas D0, D1 D2 and D3 are used as a counter. Then go into a decoder and then collect all the A, B, C, D , E , F , G ,H an0 an1 an2 an3 where each of these represent the seven segment display the way they are displayed. Where on and off, and An0 , AN1, An2, and An3 is the segment I want to display at each time. The problem I encounter is it never goes to D2,it only goes D0, D1, I am using a D-flip flop without enable and when I do a D-flip flop with enable it never moves from one. How do I change this to work as a counter and go D0, D1, D2 and D3. Why is the counter not working and going 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 (so I can display the seven segment on a segment on Bays-3 Board)

Without getting too into detail, what I'm trying to say is that my expertise is more or less in business, and have next to no experience with coding. I actually tried to start something up a couple years back with some SWE's from the top 4 tech firms, but I ended up being really disappointed in their work product and scrapped the project entirely. I found it was hard to motivate them with pure sweat equity... hah. 

So, my problem is - when I have these lightbulb moments, I often cannot bring them to life without recruiting people. 

My question is - with so many free/low cost resources out there, is it practical to learn to code and bring the initial concepts to life myself? I don't think I'd build the final version by any stretch, but something functional that looks decent that I can put in front of folks to gain traction (whether that's investors or the general public). Have any of you gone down the path of learning to code on your own for similar reasons? 

Any insights are greatly appreciated! ",0

What Frameworks to use as a beginner?,"Hi, currently I am in my third semester of university doing Software Engineering. I have dabbled in a bit of game development in Unity before but nothing to complex. I already know how to code have sufficient experience in dart, C# and C++. However recently, I decided to fully commit myself to learning mobile App development (by app development I strictly mean non-web-based hybrid apps, though I will definitely dive into web development someday as well). In order to learn mobile development, I decided to use the Flutter Framework. I had previously no experience with working with any other framework and this was my first time trying to build an app. Did I make the wrong choice by learning Flutter at the very start because I feel like these frameworks offer a lot of abstractions and starting your learning process from the abstractions can make your fundamentals weak. Recently, while coding in flutter I have often felt that I really lack a very firm grip on what I'm doing and how everything is TRULLY working.   


# Examples:

  
**1)**  When I came across the WidgetsFlutterBinding class I looked up its documentation and learnt that it is **""the glue that binds the framework to the Flutter engine""**.......what???? 

* How is it the glue? 
* Why is there a need to even bind the framework to the flutter engine??
* What exactly does binding even mean??  


**2)**  When I started to read about the BuildContext class from the documentation I ran into similar question. According to the docs:

**""Each widget has its own BuildContext, which becomes the parent of the widget returned by the StatelessWidget.build or State.build function. (And similarly, the parent of any children for RenderObjectWidgets.)""**

&#x200B;

* how does the BuildContext become the parent of the widget?
* More importantly why is there a need for the BuildContext to become the parent of the widget??
* Also what exactly does it mean that the buildContext is the ""PARENT"" of the widget? How does it effect the widget and the buildContext?  


Do you guys see what I'm trying to say. Like I don't think of myself  as dumb I actually love coding. The main reason I decided to take Software Engineering was because I love thinking and solving problems. I would spend most of my time on hackerRank in my High School days solving cool problems and it was super fun. But this isn't anything like that I'm not getting the full picture of what's going on and I think because of that when I do encounter a bug, I'm completely blank on how to fix it. Not to mention almost always the bug has something to do with some fixed ""behavior"" of the framework that I wasn't aware of. I mean at this point it feels like it's become less about solving problems and more about memorizing a predefined sequence of steps. I'm becoming worried if this field is actually suited for me or not :( What would be your guys/girl's advice. Should I pause flutter for now and divert my attention to learning more of the basics of app development. Also, should I start off with native development? would that be a better approach? Finally, if you could provide some good resources on where I should start learning I would really appreciate it.",0

Need help getting started on a web project.,"Hi everyone,

I'm embarking on a web development project and need some advice on how to implement a few specific features. Here's what I'm aiming to create:

Photo Gallery with Multiple Folders & Versioning: I need to set up a photo gallery that can be organized into various folders. Additionally, each photo should have a version view feature, allowing updates and tracking of different versions of the same image.

Login Page & Restricted Folder Access: There should be a login functionality. Once logged in, users should only be able to access the folders they have permissions for. I'm thinking of implementing user roles and permissions but am unsure of the best practices here.

Bird's Eye View Map with Room Navigation: I want to integrate a bird's eye view of a map, where users can navigate to different rooms. Clicking on a room in the map would display pictures associated with that particular room. I'm not sure how to start with this feature - what tools or frameworks would be best?

I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions on technologies, frameworks, libraries, or general advice on how to approach these features. Also, if anyone knows of any tutorials or resources that might help, that would be fantastic!

Thanks in advance for your help!",0

[Transact SQL] Shuffling data around in a table.,"I want to update a table to have the data shuffled around.

Need a fresh start on a round robin processing script,"Hi guys,

Sorry but this isn’t an exciting programming question.

So I’m writing a bash script that takes a data file with 2 other bits of information on each line. So that’s three parameters. 

The first is the data file name, second is the priority level increment of the new queue and third is the priority level increment of the accepted queue. There is an optional 4th which is the quanta value (this is the minimum amount of time a process can be serviced for before it’s removed by a process with higher priority.

The data file will outline the processes like this:

A 2 5
B 4 8
C 3 7

The first parameter is a process name, second is service time required (or I think it’s called a NUT value?), and the last is an arrival time. 

The processes are fed into a loop that has two queues, a new queue and an accepted queue. The time starts at 0 and continues until all the processes are finished. Each time iteration reduces the service time of the process at the front of the accepted queue by 1 and increments all of the processes that have arrived by the priority increment value of their respective queues.

The script essentially displays each time iteration like this, with - meaning not arrived, W meaning waiting, R meaning running, and F meaning finished. The display will look like this as an example.

T A B C
0 R - -
1 R W -
2 W R W

Ok now that I’ve explained the problem. I’ll tell you how terribly I’ve gone wrong. I created my script as initially 4 arrays that could represent lines. A not arrived array, a waiting array (new queue), an accepted array (accepted queue) and a finished queue. Each element in the array had the process name, arrival time, service time remaining, status, and priority level, and would move through queues based on the rules which are probably evident to you already. Anyways, I don’t think I had a good design because the script has become unwieldy and very difficult to debug. Has anyone got a solid design for this or some advice? Mostly I’m thinking I used the wrong data structure for this. Should I have many arrays representing for example status or service time remaining and just keep track of which one belongs to which process with like a universal index or something? Help!",0

Anyone knows how to solve min operation for chocolate bars to be k area?,"You have a bar of chocolate which can be represented as a rectangle. Originally, the chocolate bar has a width of N and a height of M. For this problem, denote (n × m) as a chocolate bar with a width of n and a height of m.
You want to eat the chocolate with a total area of exactly K. However, you always eat a chocolate bar as a whole; that is, if you eat a chocolate bar (n × m), then you will eat all the chocolate with area n• m.
To be able to eat exactly K total area, you are allowed to perform any of the following operations any number of times (possibly zero).
• Pick one bar of chocolate (n × m) then split it into two bars: (n x i and (n × (m - i)) such that i is an integer that satisfies 1 < i < m.
• Pick one bar of chocolate (n × m) then split it into two bars: (i × m) and ((n -i) × m) such that i is an integer that satisfies 1 < i < n.
Determine the minimum number of operations such that it is possible to eat some chocolate bars with a total area of K.
Input
Input consists of three integers N M K (1 < N, M < 108,1 < K < N. M).
Output
Output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations such that it is possible to eat some chocolate bars with a total area of K.

Sample Input #1
4 4 10
Sample Output #1
2

Apparently the solution goes like this


We say a bar is split by row i if an (n X m) chocolate bar is split into (i × m) and (n - ) × m). Split by column is defined similarly.
The solution to this problem always requires three or fewer operations.
If K is exactly N × M, then the answer is 0.
If K is divisible by either N or M, then the answer is 1. More precisely, if K is divisible by N, we can split by column *
Next, we check whether 2 operations is possible. We will try all possibilities of splitting by row and column. Note that two splits by the same axes (either row or column are redundant so we do not have to consider those Cases.
• Try to do the first split on every possible row i. We'll eat the (i × M) bar and further split the other bar. Next, if K - i × M is positive, check if (K - i × M) is divisible by (N - i). If yes, we can split by column and the answer is 2.
• Try to do the first split on every possible column j. We'll eat the (N × j) bar and further split the other bar. Next, if K - N × j is positive, check if (K - N × j) is divisible by (M - j. If yes, we can split by row and the answer is 2.
If none of the above is true, then we show that 3 operations is always possible. We can write
K= x × M + y (for some non-negative integer *
x and y), then we can always split the chocolate bar by row x and x + 1, then the single-row chocolate bar is split by column y.

What i don’t get is where did K-ixM comes from and without knowing that the solution is 3 or less operations? Where did you get that intuition?",0

What to do in my free time?,"Hello,

I am a first year student in university with sophomore standing currently finishing my first semester CS class centered around Object Oriented Programming in java. It has been a very engaging course that has taught me a lot about Java and coding in general.

 The issue is that I don’t know how to apply this yet to anything practical. I am starting to expand to personal projects which will allow me to make a resume and get better at coding, however it seems that many of these projects will require HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python knowledge. 

I have no issue learning these in my free time, however I am confused because they don't seem to be covered at this point in the schools curriculum.

How are students expected to get internships going into Junior year? 

What kind of projects are there that utilize only Java knowledge and look good on resumes?

I guess I just feel kind of lost and overwhelmed with the vastness of the CS sphere. My current plan is to self learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the time being then work on some personal projects which incorporate all 3. Hopefully, Python down the line. This semester is coming to an end and next semester I am enrolled in what is regarded as the hardest CS class in the curriculum, so I would rather not be overwhelmed by a lot of things at once. 

I suppose my biggest goal is to look appealing to employers. Would it be more worth my time to stay on track with the school curriculum and work for $ to pay for school on the side, or should I spend my free time taking on these additional languages as well. 

It just seems like there is a large gap between my current school teachings and what is expected of me to secure an internship.

How does one build a good middleware?,"Hello, kind people!

1. We are implementation consultants of Big Business Software
2. It has a middleware for importing and exporting data into BBS
3. It is crap, so we want to make our own middleware. Our programmer (one guy) knows .NET / Visual Studio so it will be  Windows (he does not know Mono)
4. Not using an existing open source one, we want to sell it as a product, so no GNU GPL. Making our own.
5. we need to embed a programming language that is easily used for mapping import data to the ODATA web service of BBS or the other way around, data from. NOT XSLT but something you can actually change a variable in. It should be VERY beginner friendly and easy for consultants who are not big on programming. Lua? CScript? JavaScript? God forbid some kind of BASIC? It shoul make calling WSDL and ODATA web services easy.
6. Or maybe we do not call those web services directly. We can take a hint from BBS' own middleware. They represent every kind of input or output - SQL query, ODATA web service, CSV file - as XML. And then they map with XSLT but we do not want to use XSLT. Is there an easy embedded programming language for that?
7. Edit: we need to more than mapping. E.g. this import file or this web service we call has value X, we run an SQL query, we find a result, import that value etc.
8. EDIT: our consultants know SQL mostly. HANA SQL mostly but basically SQL. 
9. This is a bit longer. The typical use case is importing a customer order from a webshop into BBS for order processing. I typically do it with XML files through SFTP, because if the middleware is down, I can just copy the last 20 files for example manually over and import it again. This is the advantage of being asynchronous, having an inbound queue of files. But with synchronous web services... suppose we are calling a webshops web service... and last time 20 we did not because it was down... how to re-try?",0

Rust offers the flexibility to use both functional and object-oriented programming styles. After some experimentation, I chose a more OOP approach for rustygram. Encapsulating the API client and bot state into a struct led to a cleaner design, simulating the real Telegram bot behavior. 🤖

I'm a Cyber security student and I feel like a clown and an imposter.,"The first few classes were fun. Making virtue boxes, learning how to take computers apart and put them back together, learning how to run command prompts, learning how to do different styles of hacking. Even learning programing has been fun. And I assumed I would have no issues because I have done a lot of work with hardware and software and fixed a lot of computers.

But my recent class has been hell. The teacher speaks very broken English. I am not a bigot I have no issues with people who do not speak English and am trilingual myself. The issue is no one can understand him. And we are getting into stuff where none of us have any experience, so it is just trying to figure it out all on our own. And the amount of homework is insane. I feel like between trying to teach myself everything and the amount of homework I am so bogged down I am having a hard time even thinking so even simple concepts feel impossible. 

In just 4 weeks almost everyone in my class has stopped replying to discussion questions and turning in the labs. I'm pretty sure at least half have dropped out.  I keep trying and turning in all my work, but it feels so pointless. I do not know if it is just this teacher or what, but everything feels impossible. ",0
Is getting a WGU BSCS worth it if I already have a Non-CS BS STEM Degree?,"**TL;DR: Is it a good use of my time to get a BSCS at WGU as someone who already holds a BS in Biology, or should I self teach? I hear that holding a BS degree AT ALL is most important, and I’m wondering if that’s true in today’s market. Will my job prospects starting out (or in the future for more advanced roles) be limited by not holding a BS in CS specifically?**

Added context below.

Hello!

I’m a 23 year old who graduated with a BS in Biology in 2022. My original plan was to go to medical school, but for a lot of reasons (including the cost and time spent, among other things), I’m not particularly interested in doing that anymore.

After graduating last year, I actually haven’t been doing anything medicine or biology related at all; I’ve been working in the entertainment industry. I love it and I’m paid pretty well (\~$125K per year). However, the last couple months of strikes on top of layoffs have shown me how unstable entertainment is as a career. So, for my future in case things get ever get rough, I’ve decided I may need to pick up another skill that I can pivot to, should I ever need to.

I recently have found that I have a decent interest in coding and programming. I’m still very new to it all, but I’m interested in it enough that I wouldn’t mind making a career out of this either. I don’t necessarily want to go back to school for another 4 years, and I’ve heard that bootcamps are only getting more unfavorable as time goes on, especially in the current market. So, I’m considering getting a BS in Computer Science at WGU, which Ive heard can be done in a much shorter span of time than 4 years. It’s also quite cheap in comparison to other options. However, I’m also pretty good at teaching myself things. I taught myself everything I needed to know for my current job in entertainment, and I was very self motivated in college with my Biology degree and finished with a very competitive GPA.

So basically, my question is this: Would actually going out of my way to get a BS in CS be worth it to me as someone who already holds a BS in Biology? I hear people say all the time that for employment purposes, it’s having the BS degree itself that matters; not necessarily what it’s in. I’m aware that I still need to self teach, make projects, network etc etc, but I just don’t want my career to be limited by not having a CS degree specifically. If I make this career change, I don’t want to hit a glass ceiling for that reason.

I just want to hear what you all think about this. Thanks!!",0

"Seeking Advice: Balancing Work, Study, and Learning to Code","Hello everyone! I'm in my mid-20s, currently working in HR at a big company, but I've always had a deep interest in technology. 
Despite having no formal background in coding, I've found myself naturally adept at understanding and even adjusting codes like VBA.I've recently embarked on a journey to learn Python. 

I purchased a recommended course on Udemy by Angela (you might be familiar with it) and dedicated 1-2 hours daily to it. Initially, everything went smoothly, and I was grasping concepts quickly. However, as the projects grew more complex, I found it challenging to manage my time due to work commitments and my ongoing online bachelor's degree in business. 
Often, I had to revisit and restart projects, which led to a feeling of being overwhelmed and ultimately a halt in my progress.

One area I'm pondering over is the use of search tools and AI in coding. Many say that these tools constitute a significant part of modern coding. While I see the value, I'm hesitant to rely on them too much in the early stages of my learning. 
My aim is to develop a strong foundational understanding first, and then leverage these tools to enhance efficiency. That said, I do find AI explanations extremely helpful when I'm stuck.

So, here's where I need your advice:

Balancing Learning and Commitments: How do you manage learning to code while balancing work and other studies?

Use of AI and Search Tools: Should I incorporate AI and search tools right from the start, or focus on developing a strong base first?

Long-Term Goals: I aspire to learn 2-3 programming languages at a basic level and eventually work on personal projects like apps, video games, or dapps. 

Post my bachelor's, I'm considering a master's in computer science. Any tips or guidance for this journey?",0

Need advice on handing over a VBA project,"I've developed a VBA module to edit & convert Excel and Word documents for my work. The module, naturally, runs off the user's computer (rather than a server).

It notably calls Pandoc (a command line tool built in Haskell I believe) for some document conversion.

The client is looking to purchase the tool off me for wider scale deployment.

The primary issue I am considering is ease of deployment - although the user doesn't need to ""look"" at Pandoc, they need it installed, and that makes rollout much more difficult than simply handing over a workbook.

What are my options here?

So far, I know I could:

1. Just strip Pandoc from the tool and handle the conversion in Word - *I've tried this and it's unbearably slow even with optimisation, plus worse results*

2. Accept that Pandoc will be required and look at ways of easing deployment for users - *I'm worried about this since it might be used in both a controlled IT environment in office, and on laptops at home (the firm has a ton of WFH staff), and that could mean painful development*

3. Somehow turning this VBA module into an online portal, where users upload their files, it runs the VBA & Pandoc on a server somewhere, and then they download the output - *I suspect this is the ideal option for the client but I have zero experience here*

For context, I am a self-taught programmer with little knowledge outside VBA, but a strong desire to optimise my code and follow best practices: so the code is in at least 'acceptable' shape and not totally hacked together. i.e. it's modular where possible, functions are generalised where effecient and possible, etc

I'm absolutely open to learning whatever I need to learn for a good solution here.

Also, the reason it was primarily built in VBA is because some of the client workbooks also use VBA: accordingly, a) my module 'hooks into them' easily as a result, and b) I initially figured that since I know the client has/had devs that chose to write in VBA, maybe writing in VBA myself would make it easier for them to maintain.

I'm working on a programming language in go,"So, I recently started programming in Go (I wanted to know some compiled language besides virtual machine c#, I first tried c/c++ but it didn't suit me and between Rust and Go I chose Go because of its simpler syntax and similarity to c#. Anyway, back to the point). I chose to create a programming language as my first project for learning - I had already done it, horribly, but done it in c# so I knew how to do it.

I sort of have something to work with already - basic flowcontrol, variables, functions and even library support, which I want to focus on along with some GUI support.

Now I would be very grateful if someone would take a look at the project or try it out and write me if I'm doing something wrong or there's a bug.

>u/tenexdev: Also a language specification would be good so we could compare it to something.

    41     return matching

When BFS is called (line 1), for all unpaired vertices from U, it sets its distance to 0 and adds them to the queue. Which means, now, every vertex from U is a ""root"" with distance 0.

`First question:`Then, why does the pseudocode bother to calculate if Dist\[u\] < Dist\[NIL\] in line 11? We already know it is **true** because Dist\[u\] is 0 and Dist\[NIL\] is inf (Dist\[NIL\] was set to inf in line 8)

`Second question:`What does line 21 exactly accomplish?

        costs[0]=0
        #parent = {0:0}

            for k in edges:
                if costs[k[1]]>costs[k[0]] + k[2]:
                    costs[k[1]] = costs[k[0]] + k[2]

    {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 2, 4: 7}

I feel that as per the tutorials and notes, the order of traversal of edges should matter and costs should have different value for each iteration until it converges to final optimal value. Can I kindly get some help on how do we decide the sequence of traversal of edges? thanks",0
Java Matcher object not matching string despite Regex being correct.,"I am currently working on a personal project just to kill some time. It is a Java program that parses and generates a website for Python documentation. I am nearly completed and have had the program working fine on large chunks of python code. However I seem to run into an issue with this specific block:

    Python
    
    """"""d
    Clamps values between 0 and 100.
    :param value :- The value to clamp :- number
    :return The value after the clamping :- number
    """"""
    def clampPercent(value): 
        return max(0, min(value, 100))

&#x200B;

As mentioned I had the Java code working on numerous other documentation instances but this one simply does not work. The Regex should select the quotes, the commented portion, as well as the name and parameters of the function. I produced and tested my Regex on RegExr. A link to my Regex on the site along with the accompanying text can be found [here](https://regexr.com/7np9o).

A simple test in Java shows that the Matcher object does not find any valid matches at all:

    Java
    
    String regex = ""\""\""\""d[\\[\\]\\(\\)\\{\\},\\.\\w\\s;:\\-\\+\\*\\/]+\""\""\""\\n\\s*((class)|(def)) [\\w\\s(),]+:"";
    
    String content = ""\""\""\""d\nClamps values between 0 and 100.\n:param value :- The value to clamp :- number\n:return The value after the clamping :- number\n\""\""\""def clampPercent(value):\n    return max(0, min(value, 100))"";
    
    Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(content)
    System.out.println(matcher.find());

Ideally this should simply output ""true"" to the console. However I am only receiving ""false"".

If anyone has any information on what I am doing incorrectly or why this behavior is occurring, any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

"Is it fair to call PHP a ""dynamically typed C with no pointers""?","If you think about it linguistically, that is what PHP essentially is.

Its syntax is 100% borrowed from C/C++, only the variables are prefixed with a certain symbol to motivate the coding peasants of the resulting remuneration which is about to arrive after a successful delivery.

Being an interpreter, it also doesn't have to declare runtime headers like `stdio.h` or `conio.h`, most needed functions are built-in and self contained within PHP itself.

Even the OOP concepts like classes have parallels in C++ syntax but that's probably where the similarity ends.

But now that I think about it, Java can also well be called ""C without no pointers but a comprehensive runtime library""!",0

Tesseract failing to provide accurate results with extremely clear images,"&#x200B;

[LINK TO ORIGINAL + PREPROCESSED IMAGES + SPECIFIC EXAMPLES](https://imgur.com/a/88K970O)

[LINK TO CODE](https://ideone.com/mapYbt)

So I'm working on a simple API that receives and image of text that contains both regular text and text encoded in hexadecimal, and then performs OCR and decodes the hexadecimal text to ASCII.

I'm using node.js and TypeScript, so I have tesseract installed locally and I'm using node-tesseract-ocr. I've experimented with every possible oem and psm combination possible, I've tried different types of pre-processing, I've even tried a whitelist to prevent errors like ""c"" being recognised as ""¢"", but what ends up happening is it skips the ""c"" entirely. I'm looking at the pre-processed image and I swear that could not be a clearer ""c"", yet it still gets it wrong. In other examples, it confuses ""4F"" with ""47"". These errors completely ruin the hexadecimal decoding, which is the whole purpose of the app.

What am I doing wrong here? I thought tesseract was supposed to be excellent at this stuff. I'd switch to using a cloud service, but I wanted to do it locally and avoid the whole song and dance you have to perform just to authenticate with Google's Vision API.

Merge PR vs Squash and Merge,"So I have been programming for a while now but recently noticed the option of Squash and Merge. I was working in a webdev team where they allowed only squash and merges.

I am pro for ""Squash and Merge"". There may be multiple commits that just rename objects, move files around, etc. When the feature branch matures, it is 1 commit that introduces an atomic change. It does not clutter the history, and instead of having 10 commits changing small stuff, you have a big PR commit that actually makes a value to the project.

However, many people do not like Squash and Merge because you lose the exact commit history of the PR. I want to know more opinions on this matter.",0

JWS signature validation problem using NodeJS,"I got a problem with verifying a JWS signature from a third party that I use for payments. I tried many different things and I still cannot verify the token correctly.

Here's my code in NodeJS that I used trying to implement a function that validates JWS signature:

    Function to validate JWS signature
    async function validateSignature(req) { // Get Request X-JWS-Signature header const jws = req.headers[""x-jws-signature""]; if (!jws) { return false; }
    try { // Decode received headers json string from base64_url_safe const headersJson = JSON.parse( Buffer.from(jws.split(""."")[0], ""base64url"").toString() );
    // Get x5u header from headers json
    const x5u = headersJson.x5u;
    if (!x5u || !x5u.startsWith(""https://secure.tpay.com"")) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Get JWS sign certificate from x5u uri
    const certificate = await axios.get(x5u).then((response) => response.data);
    
    // Verify JWS sign certificate with Tpay CA certificate
    const trusted = await axios
      .get(""https://secure.tpay.com/x509/tpay-jws-root.pem"")
      .then((response) => response.data);
    
    // Verify certificate using jsrsasign library
    const x509 = new X509();
    x509.readCertPEM(certificate);
    const isValid = x509.verifySignature(trusted);
    if (!isValid) {
      console.log(
        ""FALSE - Signing certificate is not signed by Tpay CA certificate""
      );
      process.exit(1);
    }
    console.log(isValid);

    // Encode body to base64_url_safe
    const payload = Buffer.from(body)
      .toString(""base64"")
      .replace(/=/g, """")
      .replace(/\+/g, ""-"")
      .replace(/\//g, ""_"");
    
    const jwsData = jws.split(""."");
    const headers = jwsData[0] || null;
    const payloadEncoded = jwsData[1] || null;
    const signature = jwsData[2] || null;
    console.log(headers+"".""+payload+"".""+signature);
    
    // Decode received signature from base64_url_safe
    const decodedSignature = Buffer.from(signature, ""base64url"");

    console.log(publicKey);
    const verifier = crypto.createVerify(""RSA-SHA256"");
    verifier.update(headers + ""."" + payload);
    
    if (!verifier.verify(publicKey, decodedSignature)) {
      console.log(""False - invalid signature"");
    } else {
      console.log(""verified"");
    }
    return true;
    } catch (error) { console.error(""Error validating JWS signature:"", error.message); return false; } }

This code outputs ""False - invalid signature"".

Here's the part of documentation that I use to implement this:

>POST Notifications are signed with JWS signature. We use the RFC 7515: JSON Web Signature (JWS). The signature is available in the header X-JWS-Signature. The content of the notification should be validated on the basis of a publicly available certificates:

>Signature certificate [https://secure.tpay.com/x509/notifications-jws.pem](https://secure.tpay.com/x509/notifications-jws.pem) Tpay CA root certificate [https://secure.tpay.com/x509/tpay-jws-root.pem](https://secure.tpay.com/x509/tpay-jws-root.pem) For security reasons it is mandatory to verify the JWS signature to ensure that notification comes from the tpay.com notification service.  
>  
>For an example PHP implementation, see the examples section on the right.  
>  
>Keep in mind that this is only a basic example to help you understand the JWS signature verification process and should be adjusted to meet your requirements. There are a lot of external libraries to verify JWS token. You can find list of them in many languages on [https://jwt.io/libraries](https://jwt.io/libraries)

Feel lost with learning need help,"Hi I started my journey with learning js about 2-3 months ago I watched almost whole course of Jonas Schmedtmann and I literally forggot everything I had a few brakes becouse of private situations.
I forggot stuff like classes destructing how to work with maps etc and I feel lost.
I can do some simple stuff but I don't know what to do, I feel like I should start over with different approach I basically didn't done much stuff myself since beginning of the course I didn't implemented stuff what I learned and becouse of that I basically know nothing...
What would you do ? from one side I feel sick to my bones to start learning from the start as I feel  I am standing all the time in one place with my learning from the other side I would want to start again fresh with different approach not coding along and actual start doing stuff myself from the start so it's sticks in my brain.
I been thinking about The Odin project as basically from the start you are forced to do everything yourself.
Or it will be waste of time to start whole odin project from the start  and I should just review lessons again even on youtube or watch schmedtmann 2x speed and straight ahead implement the stuff what he's saying.
Or just leave all the courses and just try and build stuff for the next month ?",0

However all I have ever been taught is the type of programming where It'll just output words and nothing else in the IDE. I want to learn how to create apps and whatnot but I just dont know how to move from getting word outputs to actual working GUI code (apologies idk the lingo).

"Am I understanding the basic concept of Fetch, Decode and Execute?","I'm currently studying fetch decode and execute am I understanding it correctly (When the computer gets data from an input device or if a user opens a file on the hard drive it is stored in the RAM. The Program counter stores an address which is an address for the next instructions that need to be executed.  The address is sent from the program counter to the MAR using an address bus. The MAR then sends the address to the location in the RAM using an address bus. Once the RAM has received the address the data stored is sent to the MDR using the data bus. The MDR then sends it to the CIR using the data bus. The CU then decodes the information using an instruction set. If any calculations are required the ALU will calculate them and storing any interim values on the ACC. The instructions can then be performed by the CPU)

Stuck in this exercism.,"I'm doing the CS50 course and i had this exercism wich i have to print a pyramid with # that looks something like this (replace the \* for blank space) in C language using the height between 1 and 8 (include) choosed by the user:

\*\*\*\*#  
\*\*\*##  
\*\*###  
\*####  
\#####

But my code isn't working and i don't wanna go to the chatgpt.

Please, don't give me the answer! I just wanna some hint!

Here is my code:

`int main(void)`

`{`

`// Recebe uma altura do usuário entre 1 e 8;`

`int h;`

`do`

`{`

`h = get_int(""Altura: "");`

`}`

`while (h < 1 || h > 8);`

`// acrescenta uma quebra de linha até que atinja a altura`

`for (int i = 0; i < h; i++)`

`{`

`// acrescenta uma # de acordo com a quantidade de quebra de linha`

`for (int b = 0; b <= i; b++)`

`{`

`for (int j = h - 1; j > i; j--)`

`{`

`printf("" "");`

`}`

`printf(""#"");`

`}`

`printf(""\n"");`

`}`

`}`

I did the first pyramid that looks like this:

\#  
\##  
\###  
\####  
\#####

And i know how to do the reverse, because to have the right pyramid i need to replace theses # for blank space, then it'll seems like:

\*\*\*\*#  
\*\*\*##  
\*\*###  
\*####  
\#####

So i know i need to make a mix of these two than i can get the right pyramid, but when i mix them, it doesn't works. I'm gettin this output to my code:

I don't know if I'm being contrarian here, but I think, because of reasons previously listed, it is a better idea to not spend my time researching mainstream topics, when its not that relevant to me. And currently I think its good idea to hold off learning AI untill the dust has settled. Peace!",0

What do you think of the snapshot versions?,"Hello everyone. In my company we have our own framework that is used by multiple of our own projects. The framework is currently versioned by having all the features and bugs in a version called snapshot that everyone can use and from time to time the version is closed to a fixed version X.x.x. As all projects use the Snapshot in production, when it is compiled, new bugs that have not been well tested or new changes for the better are sometimes accidentally deployed. Independently, I consider that although the changes are for the better, it should be the protector that prints it that decides to have these new features, being hooked to the x.x.x, not to the development snapshot


What is your opinion? Personally, I think that they should leave snapshot as a kind of beta (it is not well tested) and that projects in production always use fixed x.x.x  And update when they decide.",0

Redux vs. Context API + useReducer,"Currently, I am learning Redux (RTK). On its official documentation website, it is recommended to learn redux's basics first since the RTK core is based on that.

Nested linked lists in C,"Hello, 

I have been trying to teach myself the basics of using C. Recently I have begun to tackle singly linked lists. And I did have success with the most basic linked list.

I came across [this example of nested linked lists](https://gist.github.com/nikAizuddin/c666f9229135e1d8feab) which solved a similar problem, but only allows for one element.

Propositional Logic Dinner Game Advice,"Looking for advice on how to logic out the logic behind this proposal logic game (lol)…

Im trying to create a logic puzzle game that would be laid out in a dinner table sort of way.

Basically, you are given an empty table with 6 chairs and 6 place settings; each pair is labeled with a letter. The player then has to arrange 6 non-repeating guests and 6 non-repeating meals into their correct spots.

In order to do this, they are given a list of instructions mandating where guests & meals can and cannot be. Possible instructions could include things like:

- Vivian is not sitting next to a man
- Charles has either the fish or the pasta
-Lisa is sitting across from the person with the steak
-Amy is sitting to the left of George

I am trying to figure out a way to systematically design these instructions so that I can make sure that there is only one solution. I imagine that this can be done using truth tables or logic gates & lists of some sort, but I am quite lost on how to do this as methodically as possible. 

Any advice or links to similar games with instructions would be very appreciated. Thank you!! 

TL/DR: I’m trying to make a propositional logic game where a given set of rules determines how guests at a table can be arranged.

[Java] How to check if the result of a calculator is a whole number,"Hello,

Junior Software Engineer Struggling To Make Progress on Any Ticket,"Bit of background: Graduated with as a mechanical engineer, worked in mechanical engineering for a year, hated it, started learning programming, got a job after 3 months, left after 7 as they were too results focused, joined another company, the people were awful, left after 3 months and now in my current role as a junior full-stack dev working with PHP/Laravel/Typescript/Angular. Been here for 7 months and the company is amazing and could see myself here for a long time!

build type dependent compilation?,"i want to have certain files get compiled if im in debug mode, that dont get compiled if im in release, like for example, vulkan validation layers, i want those if im in debug, but not in release.

the idea is that ill have a Debug.h that gets included no matter what, but if im in release, only stubs will define the functions, which will get wiped out by the compiler at -O2, but if im in debug theyll actually get implemented.

    - debug
      |- Debug.h
      |- include
        |- vulkan
          |- ValidationLayers.h

          |- ValidationLayers.cpp
      |- impl
        |- vulkan
          |- ValidationLayers.cpp

is this a good structure for this? is there a better way to do this? im also planning on making a script that will automatically create stubs, but the current worry is that to change a function name for example, id have to change it in at least 3 different places.

why my do-while does not work?,"Hey, i'm trying to make a program in which you introduce the scores of differents exams, but i want the input to be limited to values from 0 to 10 (no characters and not negative numbers), for this i have done this do-while in which it must only get the input if the value is between 0-10.

&#x200B;

the code works with positive values, but the thing is when it gets a character.

So it works in the case 1°, but in 2°:

1. if i write first a negative number the code asks me for a real value (0-10) and keeps asking until it gets the value. (no problems here)
2. here's the thing, if i write first a character/special character the code tells that i have to input a valid value but it also saves the value (in ASCII), then proceeds to ask for the next score in the exam 2.

so my question here is, why does my code exits the do-while even if it detects that is a value out of the range from 0-10?

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    float p1=0,p2=0,p3=0;
    
            do{
    	printf(""Ingresa la calificacion del parcial 1: \n"");
    	if (scanf(""%f"", &p1) !=1 || p1<0 || p1>10){
    		printf(""mete un valor válido\n"");
    		while (getchar() != '\n');
    	}
    	
    } while( p1<0 || p1>10);
    
    do{
    	printf(""Ingresa la calificacion del parcial 2: \n"");
    	if (scanf(""%f"", &p2) !=1 || p2<0 || p2>10){
    		
    		printf(""mete un valor válido\n"");
    		while (getchar() != '\n');
    	}
    } while(p2<0 || p2>10);

here the response of my code when i input character first:

&#x200B;

Ingresa la calificacion del parcial 1: (asking for the score of the first examn) help please (my input) mete un valor válido (message to introduce a valid value) Ingresa la calificacion del parcial 2: (asking for the second exam)

why my do-while does not ask again for a value even if i introduce a character in the first try?

How are we supposed to do this if we don’t know what a class or method is?! I mean I kinda think i do... a class is like a C struct except it contains functions, and methods are those functions which we can call to work with those classes. Is that correct?

Programming is pretty fun,"Hi everyone, 

Just a little bit of backstory, I am a young adult, 24 years old just trying to figure out what it is he wants to do in life still. Currently, I’m working in IT and I love it, I was a big computer guy growing up playing games, so I took that passion and turned it into what is now my current career in IT. 

During my short years in this field, and wanting to learn as much as possible I have began working towards my Associates of Science in Cloud Architecting, which introduced me to the wonderful world of python in my intro to computer programming class. 

This single class has now made me interested in pursuing a computer science degree, along with just wanting to learn more about programming in general. I’m a few hours into the CS50 YouTube video, where he is going over C and while the syntax is a lot weirder, my brain is kind of just connecting the dots with what I know about python, and python seems to so far share a pretty similar syntax, it’s just more modernized. 

Suffice to say, would a career shift towards development/programming be a good idea? Perhaps are there roles where both IT and development overlap where I can use both? I’m still in my infancy with programming, and im looking forward to learning how to write applications with things like GUIs, APIs, etc. 

Are there any languages I should really focus on? C# has kind of caught my eye, it seems to be able to do a lot, but I’d imagine that could probably be said about all languages.",0
Problem trying to password protect a certain page using .htaccess and .htpasswd,"I created a .htpasswd file in my home directory, and have an existing .htaccess file for all of my site pages. I am trying to password protect only one of these pages.

I tried grouping a new .htaccess file with the file/page I am trying to protect in a subfolder / subdirectory within the directory for my site, but the pages start to malfunction (maybe because I used a website builder? I am unsure if there is a way around this problem - very new to this).

When I add only the code below into the .htaccess file for the entire website without any more commands, the password protection works / functions properly with the right username/password found in .htpasswd, but the entire site is password guarded. I am unsure how to target only the one file/webpage rather than targeting my entire website! I have tried a couple different commands such as Location, Files, FilesMatch (surrounding the entire thing or just ‘require valid-user’), but the password protection disappears entirely / stops working when I use them. 

AuthType Basic 
AuthName ""Please Log In"" 
AuthUserFile /home/myusrname/.htpasswd Require valid-user

should I set event listeners before or after render the associated form?,"Let's imagine a simple page. You click a button and then a form get rendered above an overlay.

So far, I have been setting an event listener in top of my code for this particular button. Inside the callback function that gets called some code run like the one that sets the overlay. Then, also inside this callback function, I render the form and then I set the eventListener for the submit button for the form.

Now, this works just fine with some small code, but when things get bigger it's kinda a problem, because I have a hell of a tree of callback functions and event listeners. Also I have read here about that and how it's a problem in the everyday.

So, I have reached a solution after some advices and some reading, and I wanna now if what I have decided is correct or it's not: instead of defining my event listeners inside callback functions, I can do from the very beggining. For the example above, I could define listeners like so:

`document.querySelector("".add-button"").addEventListener(""click"", render_form)`

`document.querySelector("".location-form form"").addEventListener(""submit"", submit_form);`

This way event listeners get defined before the submit button can be seen by the user. I don't need to define every listener that will exist, but I can for the most important ones.

Best GUI for Python distributable app,"I’m not even sure if I’m phrasing this correctly, feel free to correct me. This situation is this: we have some medium sized Python code base that we currently run via command line. There’s a desire to add a gui for easier use for users.

However, we do not need this to be a web app since we just want it to be a desktop application. I read into some stuff on Electron + Python + React which seems like a viable option.

Beyond My Basic Skills,"Hi all, 

(my apologies if this has already been discussed)

I'm already familiar with what I (unexperienced) would consider the basics: manipulating variables, arrays, for-loops, etc. I'm comfortable with that sort of thing and confident that with what I know I could find the answer to anything I'm missing along the way. 

My degree was in mechanical engineering, so I have some experience coding with motors and sensors (think arduino-type projects), but I'd love to be able to create my own web/phone apps and interactive websites - a way to incorporate my own art into my experience online (not necessarily for anyone but me to use). 

I'm not sure what I need to know, or even how to start a basic project -- when I try to google it most of what I see are services geared to beginners that seem like they kind of do the coding for you (not what I want - I want to actually learn how to do it myself). Do any of you know of a good starting point for me or some initial resources I can begin with? (thanks!!)",0

Old Advent of Code Practice Problems (C++),"I've been looking for coding challenges to beef up my skills and I came across this site called Advent of Code. I tried the first challenge, and I made pretty good progress, but when I try to paste the text from my ""directions"" into the console, I'm not getting the entirety of the text. Which leaves me with two questions:

1. Is there a limit to the length of text that can be pasted into the console (currently using VS2022).
   1. Side note, if I input the string into the code directly, I get the correct answer, but not when pasting the code into the console while the program is running.
2. I'm still a beginner with C++, so any feedback about improving or optimizing code would be appreciated.

Ideas for adding feature to simple Python card game,"I'm at the very beginning stages here, basically just typing out projects I find online,  fixing the errors/typos, working backwards and using the google machine to figure out what I'm writing. **This code runs a simple card game where p1 and p2 both draw a card and the program announces who wins based on which card has higher value.**

I want to challenge myself to add another feature of the game. I have some ideas, but I would love other thoughts, and am **specifically** **asking for help knowing where to start, ideally a recommendation for a new feature to integrate that scaffolds towards a bigger project.** Any comments on my ideas, ideas of your own, or comments on the code are great!

\- Completing the program into a game of ""War"" where winner of ""round"" takes the deck until one player has whole deck.

\- Full Phase 10 game against computer. Player draws cards, submits sets of cards, and completes ""round"" when specific conditions are met. Then moves onto next round with different conditions

\- Again my main goal here is to integrate a new feature that will scaffold toward a larger project. Sort of a ""checkpoint"" toward a bigger project. 

\- I'd like to be able to add the component(s) within a few hours(?) of focused work. A challenge is great, but like I said trying to follow the dopamine so don't want something that will be horrendously frustrating.

I feel like a failure and maybe I'm just not cut out for this,"I'm sorry, I know it sounds like I'm whining I've just been having a horrible day. We had our first midterm for C++ and I basically failed it. What added extra to the demotivation is that we had a qualifying problem which we had 15 minutes to solve and I literally had the logic right but just fucked up one number which now cut me back and made me have to do it all in an exam.

Currently, the midterms was up to: for, while and do...while loops.

Honestly, if this happened this early on it feels demotivating as hell to continue. I don't really know what to do. I don't want to just ram my head into a brick wall, is there any way I can test out if I'm cut out for this? It's just met with this cold environment where I failed on even a qualifying problem just has me really demotivated. I just wish I could do this one thing.",0
Fun Programming language to learn as a beginner that can make my ideas a reality,"Hi Guys,

I’m new here and need your help to understand what language should I pick to execute some of ideas fast?? I’ve already done a lot of reading on Python, Go, JS, etc. And now i’m confused. 

Just for a bit of context, I was interested in learning programming almost a year back for a project which I wanted to build on my side. After a lot of research and starting with The Odin Project (and completing some modules there), I ended up using WP to complete that project with some custom codes which I found on stackoverflow. It worked well so I stopped pursuing programming. I now have a bunch of other ideas and I’m finding it real hard to build it using WP and all its shitty plugins. I want to make it light and smooth with less maintenance. 

Now my ideas revolve around online dictionary (for a local language here in my country), niche job portal that shows you job basis certain criteria, and some simple web file converters (pdf to excel, etc) The main priority for now is a Job portal but I hope I can learn a language that can help in all other ideas as well. I want to build these over next 6-8 months (idk if this is realistic timeline tbh).

I came up with these ideas so that I can also learn programming while having fun. I’m interested to build these for now and probably down the line, build something much complex like SAAS software or something. I know this is too ambitious but would really appreciate your help if you guys can suggest the best way forward. 

Pls help, thanks in advance.",0

Help with a “guess how many candies are in the jar” landing page,"I’m not sure how to start this project. It needs to be pretty simple and was just looking for suggestions. 

I am hosting a Christmas party in a couple of weeks with around 30-35 people. One of the things is a jar with a ton of candy in it where people will guess the amount in the jar. (Pretty standard game.) I was going to just have a box and have people put a slip of paper in with their guess but I don’t want to spend 15 minutes during the party going through all the paper slips trying to figure out who is closest to the answer. So, I thought I could put a QR code above the jar and have it go to a landing page that asks for name and amount. Then on my phone it would give me the highest guess, the lowest guess, the average guess and the closest to the correct guess.

Is this way overthinking it or not? I could probably do it all with a PostgreSQL database and a landing page. (Likely all within AWS)
But, I thought I’d ask to see if anyone had any suggestions.",0

Is it a good idea to learn Python prior to my cs classes starting if I want to go into backend development or data science for my career?,"I’m going to be starting a computer science degree in a couple of months.

I’m wanting to go into backend development or data science for my career, so I was considering Python to learn on my own as the degree I believe focuses on Java primarily.

Filling the holes in my knowledge of C language,"Hello, I am third year of college of computing and automation. First two years are basic and we had more math then programming.

Now in third year, everything is in C, as I chose to go embedded route. 
I feel like I am missing few things in my knowledge so I could follow properly and I don’t know where to start. Because I really don’t want to do intro in C for complete beginners again or similar stuff.

Can you help me out and recommend me something, course, a book, something? 

And worth of noting, intro in C was held during Corona, everything was online and it was significantly made more easy, a lot was skipped. 
So kinda intro in C for people with some knowledge?

Java or C#: Seeking Guidance for a Future in Software Engineering,"Hello Reddit community!  
  
I'm currently a freshman computer science student and have been fascinated with computers since I was 6. My journey started with lots of video games and then at 12, I began coding with an old language called Pascal. This was my first step into the vast world of programming.  
  
My interest in computers took another turn when I delved into cybersecurity. I picked up C and Assembly language to create and reverse engineer malware. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of how software can be manipulated and protected. Alongside this, I also learned Python, Bash, and PowerShell to write useful scripts. These skills have given me a solid foundation in understanding different aspects of computing.  
  
Despite my background in cybersecurity, I've realized that my true passion lies in software engineering. I want to create and build, rather than focus solely on security. However, I'm facing a big decision that I could use some help with: Should I focus on Java or C# as I move forward in my software engineering journey?  
  
Both Java and C# seem to offer great opportunities and are widely used in the industry. I'm trying to figure out which one would be the best fit for me, considering future job prospects, the types of projects I might work on, and their relevance in the current tech landscape.  
  
I'd really appreciate your input and advice. If you have experience with Java or C#, especially in a software engineering context, your insights would be invaluable. What are the strengths and drawbacks of each language in your experience? Which one would you recommend for someone starting their career in software engineering?

How are applications built in the real world? Is it justified to build with scalability in mind from start?,"I understand that applications are built for small scale initially and then scaled up as an when needed based on the user base (unless, it's not always the case and I understood wrong). But if someone were to start building an application from scratch that has the potential to grow large in size with a large user base quickly (say, as a new startup), what tech stack is used in the real world by a team of developers that want to develop this application in mind with scalability in mind right from day one and it's initial stages? Is it justified or just unnecessary to setup a tech stack that includes Cassandra or scylla db right from the start? Or integrate IaC like terraform in the CI CD pipeline?  
  
I've only seen tutorials that either use MERN stack or Nextjs or react with prisma, planetscale or railway stack or even spring boot. Are applications with real world use cases really built that way outside of these tutorials? Use, react, Mongo, node and that's it?  
  
Now, I know there's a lot more to it than just plain mern stack. We have containers, k8s and other factors to consider like userbase, media, concurrency, latency, performance, etc etc and all that stuff.  
  
Any insights would be really helpful. Thank you! :)",0

Quick PSA: If you are writing if (condition) {return true;} else {return false;} please just stop. Especially in a strongly typed language where condition has to be a boolean anyway.,"Even a beginner in programming should understand that any expression or variable can go in a return statement, not just raw values. And any `condition` is going to be an expression, and thus, can be returned directly. I do not know of any programming language that does not work this way.

I say `if (condition) {return true;} else {return false;}` is not just a 'style preference.' Rather, it is just plain **bad** code that adds extra boilerplate with no benefit. It makes the code slower, both to read, since it is unnecessarily longer with no added readability, and to execute, because it adds one extra if statement to run. Not all compilers even optimize that. And there is no compiler optimization if you are using an interpreted language.

Just write: `return condition;` instead.",0

Coding confusion,"Recently I saw a video of a a movie broken down frame by frame into its dominant colors. At the end it created this amazing color palette. For a while I have been trying to code something to do the same thing, but nothing is working. And I don’t know what to do.

This is the inspiration: [https://youtube.com/shorts/ujPrv9iGXwo?si=s5XsR7VW-qQ6CaE-](https://youtube.com/shorts/ujPrv9iGXwo?si=s5XsR7VW-qQ6CaE-)

It's too much to do just by hand if there's 24 frames a second. Any advice would be much appreciated.

EDIT: This is what I’m working with (opencv, python, ffmpeg, moviepy, pillow). I am testing in junyper labs. I am very new to coding and have only worked in Visual Code Studio in the past.

Code:

def get\_dominant\_color(image):  
pixels = np.array(image)  
pixels = pixels.reshape((-1, 3))  
dominant\_color = np.argmax(np.bincount(pixels\[:, 0\]))

"I have a little bit of experience in programming, but I'm stuck","Help me Redditors!

So I've been programming for about 7 or 8 months using py (more than 2 years doing it a few times per month, but I just took it seriously now) but I'm always wondering if it's good to copy-paste or base my code on someone else work. I feel like I'm not actually programming if I don't make it myself.

I'm also at that point when I'm skilled enough to understand and use the basic commands, but not enough to make a whole project myself.

Am I supposed to learn and memorize all of the information to make a project? Or is it okay to just comprehend it based on someone else work?

I gotta also say that in all this time I haven't used any other programming  language (I heard that it is better to be good at one than to be a beginner in several ones)

In a 2D plane, the distance between two points, the line equation that crosses two points can be found using the formulas below:  
linear distance: distance = sqrt((x1 - x0)\^2 + (y1 - y0)\^2))  
slope intercept form: y = mx + b  
In this case, the coordinates for both points and the distance are doubles.

Program requirements:  
The C program defines a structure to store the city information, and reads a file into an array of such structures; after reading the file the program will display a menu, as described below.  
The file has the following format:  
double double c-string  
For example:  
X-Coordinate Y-Coordinate City Name  
18.30 66.10 San Juan, P.R.  
21.18 157.50 Honolulu, Hawaii  
24.33 81.48 Key West, Fla.

27.57 82.27 Tampa, Fla.  
29.23 98.33 San Antonio, Tex.  
29.45 95.21 Houston, Tex.  
Where  
\- Column 1 is X Coordinate, or longitude  
\- Column 2 is Y Coordinate, or latitude  
\- Column 3 is City Name. It may include state/province and country.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Given two cities, entered using the city name (e.g., Houston, Tex. and Tampa, Fla.), the program will:  
i) Compute the linear distance between the two cities.  
ii) Find the closest city to the first city entered.  
iii) Display the list of cities in the same state/province of the first city entered.  
The program should display a menu with the following options:  
Select one of the following options:  
a) Display the table.  
b) Enter the cities (C0 and C1).  
c) Compute the distance.  
d) Find the closest city to C0.  
e) Display the cities in the same sate/province of C0.  
f) Exit.  
The valid options are only lower case letters from a to f.  
Any other input should display a message (Invalid Option!) and display the menu again.  
When the user selects option:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
a: a function is called to display a table similar to the table shown above using a width of 20 for the city name, and a width of 14 with precision 2 for the x and y coordinates. First and second columns are right aligned, and third column is left aligned.  
Use the function prototype:  
void display(struct city \[\], int);  
The first argument is an array of structures, and the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size).  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
b: a function is called to ask the user to enter two ""city names"". If the user selects the same city name twice, the program will display a message (C0 and C1 cannot be the same) and display the menu again. If the user enters, for any of the cities, a name that does not exist, nor match the city name of any of the structures, the program displays a message (Invalid city name!) and displays the menu again. If successful, this option will define the indices for C0 and C1.  
Use the function prototype:  
int getCityNames(struct city \[\], int, int \*, int \*);  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third and fourth arguments are references to C0 and C1.  
The function returns 1 on success (the two indices were set), and 0 o.w.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
c: if the two city names have been selected, a function is called to compute the linear distance between the two cities and displays it on the screen, using a width of 7, and precision of 3. If the points have not been entered, the program prints a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue), and displays the menu again.  
Use either function prototype:  
double getDistance(struct city \[\], int, int, int);  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third and fourth arguments are the indices of C0 and C1.  
The function returns linear distance between city at index C0 and the city at index C1.  
\*\*OR\*\*  
double getDistance(struct city \*PC0, struct city \*PC1);  
The first argument is pointer to the first city (the index C0) and the second argument is a pointer to the second city (the index C1).  
The function returns linear distance between city at index C0 and the city at index C1.  
\*\*OR\*\*  
double getDistance(struct city PC0, struct city PC1);  
The first argument is the structure at index C0 and the second argument is the structure at index C1.  
The function returns linear distance between city at index C0 and the city at index C1.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
d: if the two city names have been selected, a function is called to find the closest city to C0 (the first of the two cities entered in part b). The closets city must not be either of the cities selected with option b. The program displays the closest city and its coordinates as (city name,x\_coord,y\_coord).  
For example, assume the closest point to CO was Honolulu, Hawaii, then the city is printed on the screen as (Honolulu, Hawaii, 21.18, 157.50). Use precision of 2 for the x and y coordinates. If the cities have not been entered, the program prints a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue), and displays the menu again.  
Use the function prototype:  
struct city \* getClosestCity(struct city \[\], int, int, int);  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third and fourth arguments are the indices of C0 and C1.  
The function returns a pointer to the closest city (if found), or NULL (not found).  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
e: if the two city names have been selected, a function is called to display the cities in the same sate/province of C0 (the first of the two cities entered in part b). Both C0 and C1 can be included. You can assume that state/province/country is the text after the first comma.  
For example;  
For Austin, Tex. the state/province/country is Tex.  
For Toronto, Ont., Can. the state/provicen/country is Ont., Can.  
If the cities have not been entered, the program prints a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue), and displays the menu again.  
Use the function prototype:  
void citiesIntheSameState(struct city \[\], int, int);  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is tis the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third argument is the index of C0.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
f: will exit the program. No function call is needed.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Notice  
Options a to e must call a function to perform their respective action.  
The program will finalize ONLY when option f is chosen.  
Options a and f can be selected any time, no check/test is needed.  
Options c, d, and e, must test if the city names were entered (i.e., option ""b"" was previously selected). Otherwise the program must print a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue) and display the menu again.  
You can assume city name is always <=50 characters and there are no more than 1000 cities in the input file.  
You can use stdio.h, and math.h for sqrt() and pow().

Wanting to create a web scraper/search website - not sure which language to use?,"Hi there. For my CS class, I have a project assignment.

Then, I want my website to search this scraped data and return results based on key word searches.  
  
I've been playing around with Python and JS but I really don't know what coding language would be best as I'm worried it would run slow.

Seriously. Fuck everyone who tells you that you're not the problem. You are.  


If you've been trying to learn to code for hundreds and hundreds of hours, but can't remember the basics or can't get to the point that you can pursue your own projects? You need to find different work. Seriously, what the hell do you think is going to happen if you ever actually get hired? You need to have an internal drive to propel yourself up the competency hierarchy. Bitching and complaining or expecting hand holding that lasts through more than just the basics is self-defeating. People trying to win social feel-good points telling you not to give up? They're evil af. If you suck at something, it's best to figure that out before wasting years of your life.  


I have yet to find someone who went on to be a success professionally, who didn't have the internal drive and self-discipline to push through to a stage where they could do projects on their own within a couple hundred hours of self-study. If you find after several hundreds of hours that you're falling behind your peers? Give up. For your own sake. Find something you can do. Life is too short to waste it on things you're not meant for.",0
What are some popular database options for building a web app?,"Hi there,

I'm currently under way building a fitness based web app, and I would like to create a login system as the very first feature I develop before moving on to more complicated database tasks within my app. 

To do this, I believe I should start by creating a database for my login data.  As an absolute beginner when it comes to databases and SQL, I'm not sure what technology to use for this.   After researching some of the options, I am thinking either MongoDB or PostgreSQL.  

I'm also juggling the fact that I'm on the market for a junior developer job, and that if I am to learn a database technology, I'd like it to be a valuable skill to add to a resume.   

What do you all think?

Form Issues,"Hello, I have been working on this code for an assignment for a while and can't seem to find what is wrong with it.

Udemy Courses for New Grad,"As its closing in on black friday, what are some of the most worthwhile courses on Udemy for a recent graduate looking for their first job?

&#x200B;

I want to focus on ASP.NET for my backend skills, and React for my frontend skills. 

&#x200B;

I am open to either, or a combination of the two in one course as I do not have a job yet and open to front end or backend development. Going off job listings in my area, .NET for backend and React for frontend seem to be the most sought after, so I believe becoming decent at these two will help with the employment search.

&#x200B;

If there are any courses you feel are helpful for prospect full stack developers, feel free to drop them in the comments even if they are not related to React / .NET. Possibly something on general Interview Prep / DSA for leetcode  / Technical interviews would be another area I'd like to work on.

One system consisted of a django frontend, communicating through websockets with a web.py backend. 

The backend then distributes tasks to microservices with rabbitmq. The microservices perform their tasks, usually with selenium and then return their answers to the backend. The backend then sends each answer to the frontend for the user to read.  


The whole system was dockerized and placed on an ec2 container.  


This allowed one user to quickly check a variety of data from a variety of sources at the click of a button.

Did I correctly convert functional style code into OOP style code,"I had a python script to execute SQL scripts against trino-python client and I parameterized everything via a YAML template. The script was entirely functions and sequence of calls was done in _ _main_ _ and code was basically

    def fetch_yaml(some_location):
        yaml.load(some_location)
        return dict_parameters

    def connect_to_trino(dict_parameters):
        params = {
            'server_address :dict_parameters.get('server_address')
        }
        cursor = trino.connect(**params)
        return cursor

    def fetch_sql_from_yaml(dict_parameters):
        sql_statement = dict_parameters.get('sql_script')
        return sql_statement

    def execute_sql(cursor, sql_statement):
         cursor.execute(sql_statement):
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        dict_parameters = fetch_yaml(environment_variable_location)
        sql_statement = fetch_sql_from_yaml(dict_parameters)
        cursor = connect_to_trino(dict_parameters)
        execute_sql(sql_statement)

So I wanted to modify the behavior because sometimes I just need to execute one specific statement from the YAML template and sometimes I need to execute every single one. So okay that's a good case for classes because that's managing a state right? Before I got to that I just wanted to create a class version of the current code and it looked something like this 

    class trino_executor
        def __init__(self, some_location):
            self.some_location = some_location
            self.dict_parameters = self.fetch_yaml()
            self.sql_statement = self.fetch_sql_from_yaml()
            self.cursor = self.connect_to_trino()
            self.execute_sql()
    
        def fetch_yaml(self):
            yaml.load(self.some_location)
            return dict_parameters
    
        def connect_to_trino(self):
            params = {
                'server_address': self.dict_parameters.get('server_address')
            }
            cursor = trino.connect(**params)
            return cursor

And here is where I started questioning myself, it seems like I pretty just shifted _ _main_ _ to _ _init_ _ and in some respect it feels the abstraction is less clear because every method is now (self): instead of (param1, param2). I work in data engineering so alot of my code is functional in the sense there is pretty much always an order of operation. I am stuggling with the mindshift of when to use OOP. In this example, should I have even tried OOP? and was this the way to do it in OOP? Thank you",0

Java's 13th order polynomial has somehow beat my third-order polynomial in computational efficiency. How did they do it?,"I constructed a java program designed to measure the time it takes (in nanoseconds) for java to take a user input ""t"" and pass it through a home-made cubic interpolation of sin(2 \* pi \* t) over \[0,1\], and then separately, compares it to Java's math package's native ""sin"" function that ""t"" passes through too using a 13th order polynomial according to this [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26146190/how-is-sine-implemented-in-java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26146190/how-is-sine-implemented-in-java)

Java's math package's sin function **takes as much or less time** to process than my simple cubic approximation.

One component of ""why"" this is is because I have a int n = (int) t line of code. Why do I have that? Because this is the most minimal extra information I need to ""repeat"" my cubic spline over future intervals. When I add that most minimal, extra piece of information, it drags down the processing by several orders of magnitude. Without that (int) t, my cubic approximation is only SLIGHTLY faster.

So, how did the geniuses manage to get sin(t) to approximate any value with better numerical efficiency than simply a cubic?

Also, should I expect this feat of engineering to be true for any and all combinations of elementary functions? Or, simply just sine and cosine because of some extra handy conveniences of decimal simplification and such? What I'm really trying to ask is: is it worth it to construct simplified models of more complex functions in the future, or should I just let java's math package dictate the processing of everything?",0

Quick help with recursive conceptualization,"I am taking a discrete math course with limited programming knowledge, and I am having a very tough time understanding recursion. Conceptually I have eventually understood other recursive algorithms but I have stared at this for HOURS and I still can't figure out what the algorithm is doing or why it works. This is a simple example from my course.

This is pseudocode so I apologize if I should be posting somewhere else.

Prompt:

*Give a recursive algorithm whose input is a real number r and a non-negative integer n, and whose output is r\^(2\^n) . Note that the exponent of r is 2\^n.*

`SuperPower(r, n)`  
  
`Input: A real number r and a non-negative integer n.`  
`Output: r^2^n.`  
  
`If (n = 0), Return( r )`  
`p := SuperPower(r, n - 1) // The recursive call`  
  
`Return( p^2 )`

I have no earthly idea how this can come up with an answer. As far as I can tell, there is literally nothing being done to R.

If n = 2 and r = 3,  somehow the function knows that p = 9 *(9\^2 = 81 which is the correct calculation)* but I don't know how...

As p changes when calling itself, where is the previous p stored?? I want to dig out my eyes with this pencil.

This one is really getting me despite being so simple and I feel super stupid at the moment, and I would REALLY appreciate your guys' input if possible.

Thank you so much.",0
Self Taught Curricululm,"Hello All, 

  
In this post, I would like to present you the current self-taught and mostly free full-stack development I am currently following. 

  
Note:   
•	This path is specifically designed to get you prepare to the fullest for a conversion master’s in information and communications Technology.   
•	Assumes that no previous education in any form of computing exists.  
•	Has beginner and advanced topics.   


Courses:   
1.	**Harvard CS50x** (approx  10 weeks to finish). This is a must even for people who will not in a sense touch computer in their life. The professor, successfully put he students to an alogirthmic and problem-solving state of mind by presenting in a very approachable manner he concepts of Computer Science.  The program can be either watched free (with out a certificate) or by paying around 200$ on edX to provide certificate. This is the best introductory course out there to enter the computing world.

   
2.	Here I present 3 options. You can either choose **The Odin Project** or **Freecodecamp** if you want a more full stack approach or **Scrimba** for Frontend and then proceed to number 3 onwards. 

  
a)	**Scrimba** (around 3 months to finish). For me is one of the best, most approachable and friendly Frontend courses outhere. The guys have done a tremendous work on the courses explaining all the concepts in a very simple way that almost everyone can understand. Costs around 90$ for 6 months. 

  
b)	**The Odin Project**. Another respectable courses that will get you from zero to hero. IT really emphasizes on all aspects of development and teaches command-line. There are two paths to follow after the Foundations course. Javascript or Ruby on Rails. The drawback is that the course is based on Linux and Unix and as such requires some time to set up a Virtual Machine in case you use windows. 

  
c)	**Freecodecamp**. I think this one is the pioneer of the free programming bootcamps. Provides self-paced curriculums on various subjects which lead to the knowledge of full-stack.

  
3.	**Freecodecamp – Relational Databases Certification**. Great course to understand the world of databases, how they work and the whole concept behind. 

  
4.	**Full-stack open**.  This is the next level after the above, which emphasizes in various technologies used on the web. It is free of charge and provides also credits for those that can complete it. 

  
5.	**BLOC-511DL: Digital Currency**. Free MOOC on Blockchain and digital currencies by University of Nicosia. With these course, you will be able to understand the world of blockchain and how digital assets work. 

  
6.	**Applied Data Science Lab by World Quant University**: A great course to understand the concepts behind Data Science, learn advanced Python and showcase some real world projects.

it is a big pain in a..s. A lot of magic everywhere, multiple inheritance and mixins. It is very hard to write testable code using Python.   
BTW, I used Python few years ago as a scripting and I very liked it. But now, it is very hard to use it.  
I am choosing between golang and java now. Any ideas?  
Thank you.",0
Does typescript actually enforce the type declarations?,"I know in Swift you can make a variable an `Int` or an `Any` making Swift, well, kind of dynamically typed in a sense. But you will not be able to assign anything other than an `Int` to your `Int` in Swift, because it only allocated enough memory for one `Int`. But is TypeScript like that, or are TypeScript type declarations just annotations that have no affect on the runtime?",0

""Can we check in early?""  
The answer is always: no (of course we are more kind than that)  
we have an FAQ on our page that says this, and its also in the check- in information. No one reads, listens, or cares and will still ask.

Help with my coding assignment,"In this homework assignment you will write a small C program, using structures and files (as the data input/output).  
You may notice that this homework assignment is pretty similar the one for HW4, but now, the structure represents a city, and instead of hard-coding the values for the array of structures you will get the information from an input file. Remember, you MUST use functions.

In a 2D plane, the distance between two points, the line equation that crosses two points can be found using the formulas below:

linear distance: distance = sqrt((x1 - x0)\^2 + (y1 - y0)\^2))

slope intercept form: y = mx + b

In this case, the coordinates for both points and the distance are doubles.

Given two cities, entered using the city name (e.g., Houston, Tex. and Tampa, Fla.), the program will:  
i) Compute the linear distance between the two cities.  
ii) Find the closest city to the first city entered.  
iii) Display the list of cities in the same state/province of the first city entered.

  
The program should display a menu with the following options:  
Select one of the following options:  
a)  Display the table.  
b)  Enter the cities (C0 and C1).  
c)  Compute the distance.  
d)  Find the closest city to C0.  
e)  Display the cities in the same sate/province of C0.   
f)  Exit.

  
The valid options are only lower case letters from a to f.  
Any other input should display a message (Invalid Option!) and display the menu again.  
When the user selects option:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**a:** a function is called to display a table similar to the table shown above using a width of 20 for the city name, and a width of 14 with precision 2 for the x and y coordinates. First and second columns are right aligned, and third column is left aligned.

  
Use the function prototype:  
void display(struct city \[\], int);

  
The first argument is an array of structures, and the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**b:** a function is called to ask the user to enter two ""city names"". If the user selects the same city name twice, the program will display a message (C0 and C1 cannot be the same) and display the menu again. If the user enters, for any of the cities, a name that does not exist, nor match the city name of any of the structures, the program displays a message (Invalid city name!) and displays the menu again. If successful, this option will define the indices for C0 and C1.

  
Use the function prototype:  
int getCityNames(struct city \[\], int, int \*, int \*);

  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third and fourth arguments are  references to C0 and C1.  
The function returns 1 on success (the two indices were set), and 0 o.w.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**c:** if the two city names have been selected, a function is called to compute the linear distance between the two cities and displays it on the screen, using a width of 7, and precision of 3. If the points have not been entered, the program prints a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue), and displays the menu again.

  
Use either function prototype:

  
double getDistance(struct city \[\], int, int, int);

  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third and fourth arguments are the indices of C0 and C1.  
The function returns linear distance between city at index C0 and the city at index C1.  
\*\*OR\*\*

  
double getDistance(struct city \*PC0, struct city \*PC1);

  
The first argument is  pointer to the first city (the index C0) and the second argument is a pointer to the second city (the index C1).  
The function returns linear distance between city at index C0 and the city at index C1.  
\*\*OR\*\*

  
double getDistance(struct city PC0, struct city PC1);

  
The first argument is  the structure at index C0 and the second argument is the structure at index C1.  
The function returns linear distance between city at index C0 and the city at index C1.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**d:** if the two city names have been selected, a function is called to find the closest city to C0 (the first of the two cities entered in part b). The closets city must not be either of the cities selected with option b. The program displays the closest city and its coordinates as (city name,x\_coord,y\_coord). 

For example, assume the closest point to CO was Honolulu, Hawaii, then the city is printed on the screen as (Honolulu, Hawaii, 21.18, 157.50). Use precision of 2 for the x and y coordinates. If the cities have not been entered, the program prints a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue), and displays the menu again.

  
Use the function prototype:  
struct city \* getClosestCity(struct city \[\], int, int, int);

  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third and fourth arguments are the indices of C0 and C1.  
The function returns a pointer to the closest city (if found), or NULL (not found).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**e:** if the two city names have been selected, a function is called to display the cities in the same sate/province of C0 (the first of the two cities entered in part b). Both C0 and C1 can be included. You can assume that state/province/country is the text after the first comma.  
For example;  
  For Austin, Tex. the state/province/country is Tex.  
  For Toronto, Ont., Can. the state/provicen/country is Ont., Can.

  
If the cities have not been entered, the program prints a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue), and displays the menu again.

  
Use the function prototype:  
void citiesIntheSameState(struct city \[\], int, int);

  
The first argument is an array of structures, the second argument is tis the number of cities in the array (it may be different of the array size), third argument is the index of C0.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
**f:** will exit the program. No function call is needed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
Notice  
Options a to e must call a function to perform their respective action.  
The program will finalize ONLY when option f is chosen.  
Options a and f can be selected any time, no check/test is needed.  
Options c, d, and e, must test if the city names were entered (i.e., option ""b"" was previously selected). Otherwise the program must print a warning message (You need to enter the city names to continue) and display the menu again.  
You can assume city name is always <=50 characters and there are no more than 1000 cities in the input file.  
You can use stdio.h, and math.h for sqrt() and pow().

Data Structures,"To spare you the boring details I'm going to school for software engineering and I cannot for the life of me understand data structures. I have already taken the class and got an A but I don't really remember it due to medical complications. I am going over my text and hopefully one of you can help me understand where I am going wrong.

1) Can someone please explain the difference in pointers -> *. Is one a reference to where that memory is going to happen and the other a reference to where the memory is?

2) I'll give you a direct example from my school textbook and please help me decipher it.

ListAppend(list, newNode) {
   if (list->head == 0) { // List empty
      list->head = newNode
      list->tail = newNode
   }
   else{
      list->tail->next = newNode
      list->tail = newNode
   }
}

Certainly, the pointer thing becomes an issue here but on top of that the book doesn't really give any other context that's it. I didn't skip the first section; I didn't play with the code; that's literally it. I understand that to append a list is to add something to the end. That's fine but if I put that into my code then try to call ListAppend I just get an error. Surely list has to be an integer or something because the variables list and newNode came out of absolutely nowhere. I can kind of follow the below example, but I don't understand why it works. Again, this may be due to pointers so that first question is kind of critical.

struct Node{
    int num;
    Node *next;
};
 
//Starting (Head) node
struct Node *head=NULL;
 
//Insert node at start
void insert_Node(int n){
    struct Node *new_node=new Node;
    new_node->num=n;
    new_node->next=head;
    head=new_node;
}

3) Where does this all go? For simplicity's sake let's say I build a singly linked list how do I get the stored values to stay stored if that makes any sense?

Vocabulary,"Hi, all!! I've recently started learning Java (with a tiny bit of html/css/javascript), and I find that I struggle to gasp concepts when they involve words that I don't know.
It's easy enough to learn the words that come up, but there are just SO MANY NEW words.

Learning the vocabulary of a subject is, to me, one of the most important parts. So with that in mind, I want to ask: does anyone have a resource/list of vocab words to learn for beginners? And intermediate etc? Thanks to all, in advanced :)",0

"MPI, WSL2, and Intel's E- and P-cores","I'm using a Debian WSL under Win11, running on a system with an i5-13600k (8 E and 6 P-cores). The code I'm running is MPI parallel but I have not written the code myself (see the code on bhac.science). 

When running with mpiexec, I can at max put in 8 cores to run on - equal to the number of E-cores. It appears to be impossible to add the P cores to this mix. Is there a reason for this? I can't seem to find conclusive information on this matter.

Any help is much appreciated!",0
Is java not so popular now? Java for beginner (bootcamp/ career switching/ graduate),"I'm a graduate who is switching career into tech, currently in a bootcamp for basic programming knowledge and python and JavaScript. I also have a tutor from tech company that I'm currently learning Java from...
I was searching the entry role/ graduate program in tech, apparently they ask for JavaScript/ python/ C... but not so much in Java, in many roles that I had a look. Is Java not in use as much for graduate/ entry role or outdated now? I am so confused, please someone can help, much appreciated",0
Beginner to coding and need a little help with a task!,"I'm doing an elective creative coding course at my university, our language is JavaScript and we are mainly using p5.js.

One of the tasks we got was: ""Create a program which draws a rectangle on the screen. If the user moves the mouse while the mouse is pressed, then the rectangle should be moved with the mouse. If the user moves the mouse but it is not pressed the rectangle shouldn't move. The mouse does not need to be inside the rectangle.

Hint: p5.js provides variables pmouseX and pmouseY which contain the previous co- ordinates of the mouse. By subtracting the previous co-ordinates from the current co- ordinates you can work out how far the mouse has moved between frames. Adding this difference to the position of the rectangle will cause the rectangle to move the same distance.""

I feel like I'm going back and forth and going over the lecture notes so much times I'm just confusing myself so any help would be great! Since this is a beginner course and we are still quite early in the course, the code can't be too complex.",0
Is it just me? Shouldn't there be one go-to community for developers?,"Hello all,

I have been programming as a hobby for around a year or two, and I've never been able to find a single developer community with all the tools I would need in one place.

People find Stack Overflow great, especially for the Q&A type aspect, but I've never just got the hang of it. I don't enjoy the UI, it's a lot more complex than just asking and recieving an answer, and it just doesn't feel amazing. This may be because I haven't used it very much, but it also seems far from begineer-friendly. Plus, there isn't a very good mobile application for Stack Overflow.

Reddit is great, I come here whenever I need advise. The only problem I find is that since subreddits are not designed for developers, it becomes annoying to share code with each other without third-party applications.

I've found some good Discord communities, and I love the live-chat aspect of asking and getting an answer, but there isn't good navigation in Discord in regards to finding already asked questions. It's more like a group chat.

There are also a bunch of smaller applications, but everything is just so spread out.

Surely, if I feel this way, there has to be other in the same situation?

Is there an opportunity here for a new social-media platform built specifically to accomodate the needs of developers? ",0

Stack vs Heap Allocation,"Can you verify a few things for me?

`std::vector<std::string> words;`

At first glance this is a stack object. Is it still a stack object even though it (probably) has members that are dynamically allocated? And are the pointers to those dynamically allocated members stored on the stack? I understand that it has a constructor/destructor so that it frees all of its data when it goes out of scope. Is that what is meant by “automatic allocation”?",0
How to have a method B that only makes sense to be called after method A is applied? Example: If (!Validator.validate()) { errors = Validator.getErrors()),"I was following a tutorial that does just that.  
It has a Validator class, which is responsible for form validation. If the input is not valid, then the user should be shown the error message as feedback.  


    errors = []
    if (!Validator.validate(uname, pw)) {
        errors.add (Validator.getErrors());
    }
    
    class Validator {
        private errors;
    
        public validate(string uname, string pw) {
            // logic
            // if conditions fail, add specific error message to errors
        } 
        public getErrors() {
            return this.errors;
        }
    
    }

So here getErrors should only be called after some validation is done, otherwise it doesn't make any sense. This is one example of many such cases. I'm more interested in a general approach to this 'cascading use of methods'. It doesn't feel right that a client should know this class so well. Or is this just fine?

Code example is language agnostic, but based on php (as in tutorial).",0

Unified Private Load Balanced IP for machine services without,"Hello,  


I find myself in analysis paralysis. 

I'm seeking guidance on achieving a unified Load Balanced IP or domain that connects all machine services, with a focus on simplicity and fundamental concepts, without diving into the complexities of various technologies like Kubernetes, routers, and diverse load balancers, along with service discovery. My goal is to understand the basics using Docker, basic local load balancers, and reverse proxies.

Here's my proposed approach, working from the cloud to the server:

**Cloud:**

* Implement an internal load balancer across all servers (see link).
   * Address the challenge of having a single point of entry across servers.
   * Consider using an elastic load balancer to handle instances starting and stopping.

**Note: How can I resolve the issue of not knowing which services are on each machine? Does routing based on specific ports solve this?**

**Server:**

* Deploy a router/reverse proxy on each server.
   * If multiple instances exist, explore the use of local load balancers to connect them.
   * How can I automate the connection of new instances?
   * &#x200B;

After implementing these steps, I would theoretically have a unified IP. However, It does not solve connections between specific services. it's like a one-way tree that scales. 

After implementing these steps, I would theoretically have a unified IP for HTTP. However, It does not solve connections between specific services. it's like a one-way tree that scales. 

**Background:**

I'm currently managing the cloud infrastructure and software stack at a small company, dealing with the challenge of routing between servers. With approximately 5 Docker services per server and plans to expand into Asia with additional servers, I'm navigating the complexities of manual routing without an internal auto-routing mechanism.

My current stack includes Cloudflare (public IP), Caddy (basic reverse proxy), and Docker Compose.

This challenge is a subset of horizontal scaling systems, where auto-routing of all traffic to the desired instance is crucial. I've heard that tools like Kubernetes (K8) and HTTP routers handle these complexities, addressing issues at both the server and cloud layers. Can K8 simplify this process for me?

  
I'm seeking guidance on navigating the complexity of integrating various technologies to work cohesively. I've explored Consul, Traefik, Docker Swarm, Skipper, Envoy, Caddy, NATS/Redis Clustering, and general concepts of microservices.

**Could you please provide direction on aligning these technologies effectively? Your insights would be greatly appreciated.**  


Your insights and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

[Recommendations] Graphical debugger for teaching (like PythonTutor)?,"I teach an intro CS class and I am looking for an IDE which visualizes program state. A tool I've been using a lot is [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com). It has two specific features I really like:

1. Show data structures graphically -> (click on the link for example)
2. Step through the program, including stepping backwards

The visualization is quite rare since most IDEs are design for expert programmers who don't need visualization (and visualization also doesn't scale for production code/data). For newbies, however, it is helps them visualize what is going on. You can easily see lists containing other lists forming a tree, or a dictionary used for memoization.

Stepping backwards is also really useful for teaching, and is generally not a feature of production IDEs (since again it doesn't scale well).

My only problem with pythontutor is the UI is clunky and covered with ads, and there is no paid version to remove them.

"Very bad at logic, but also very good at logic. What is wrong with me?","Long story short, when i attend a Mathematical Logic Test's. With Symbols, Numbers, and everything else, i can barely get 5/20 answers right. When i do the linguistically logic part where theres no math, i get absolutely solid 18-20 / 20 all the time right. I have zero trouble thinking three dimensionally, and i can also imagine how the wildest things would look like, and come up with the craziest and most uncommon problem solving methods.

My question is, since i'm currently learning to Code in C++ and im going towards Worldspace programming in smaller game engines. Why is that? Most of the time it feels i can grasp everything with ease, but as soon as numbers are included or anything that has me to count something, i fell completely stressed out and i can't find the easiest correlation between things, but when you take out the math part, i can constantly be perfoming very very well. My grades always were like : Grade A in consistently everything, but a C-D in Math until the 13th Class (im from Germany, so our grade and school system is different). I speak 4 Languages fluent including writing.

Im so bottlenecked by math, its crazy. I watched 16 hours of Gamedeveloper Math Courses, and 6 hours of a basic algebra course because i did not understand anything back in school. Result : I know how things work (since it got explained to me), but i can't use it in the real world.

Help me prepare for my next job starting in January,"Hey guys! 

I'm starting a job as a DevOps Engineer in a completely new country. I'm essentially starting a new life. 

I would like to get some tips on what exactly should I learn and how. 

I know that I'll be working with Python and Bash scripts as well as Team City as a CI/CD tool and there will be a lot of Docker.

I worked 10 months as a Software Developer for Huawei using Python and I also worked 10 months at my current workplace including December when I will be departing, as an Automation Engineer. Here I used Python mostly and read a few bash scripts occasionally. We were using the Atlassian tech stack (Bitbucket, Confluence, Bamboo, Jira), also Sonatype Nexus for artifact server, SonarQube and Openshift/Rancher with helm. I also used Docker a lot so I know the basics. 

I'm still very much a junior and my career took a turn towards devops from software dev, which I don't mind at all. 

I would say my strongest suite is Python. I have full access to a Udemy business account so I can access most of the top quality courses out there. 

My question is, should I just take a very popular course on all the techs that will be used there, and try to understand stuff by doing that or what's my best approach here? 

I will be starting on 8th of January, currently I'm doing a Python course for quite some time now. I'm really serious about this opportunity and won't let it go to waste.

C++ Classes question,"I have to make class Buffer with 3 private members: kapacitet - capcity of buffer, brojElemenata - number of elements in buffer, and bafer - buffer array in which elements are stored; public function push which stores element in bafer.

Learning Path,"I'm 23 and decided this year I wantes to do something with coding. I looked into getting my cs degree and enrolled but with my first child and Fasfa issues I decided against it for time and financial reasons. I considered a bootcamp but again my lack a babysitter means my schedule outside of work is whim of my son lol. So I decided around June that I would just do the self taught path. I found The Odin Project, did the Foundations path, then after doing those projects I used my culmative yet tiny spool of knowledge to make a simple website for my employer. After I decided to move on to the Full Stack Javascript course of The Odin Project, my plan was to do all the lessons and projects and then use my curative knowledge  to do a live project again. This time it would be alot more complicated as it would be for an amateur esports team. It would include tournament management, calenders, team logins, player API stats, video library, ect. I planned to only start once I did the Fullstack Javascript and felt comfortable. However before I had barely started a buddy of mine who is almost finished with his cs degree and has an internship asked if he could join the future project. He also told me that it would be better to not do the fullstack Javascript and rather do python or c#. He said his internship was about to switch over to .Net and having a project in .Net would look good on my portfolio. So instead we started on the more advanced project right away. 
However not even a week after we mapped out everything,  assigned tasks, and got the framework installed, my buddy said he would have to drop the project for personal reasons. Instead of switching back to Javascript and wasting more time I have stuck with the c#. It has not been easy as this my first framework and razor pages were a weird leap. So far via tutorials and documentation I have gotten comfortable with asp.Net Core, got a local database up for user logins, and even got a simple video library with azure blob storage to work. Though every task was difficult. However about a few weeks ago I realized that I don't know c# and tutorials can't build my project for me. So I tried learning with microsoft learn and  few other resources. However I still want picking up on it. Until last Monday I found a book called ""The C# Player's Guide"" and by wedsday I was confidently solving simple problems via the console app. I know this isn't much but the book has made me feel more confident in my abilities and even more in c# than Javascript. Over the weekend, after completing the first two parts of the book (with alot more to go)I decided to try my knowledge and started to make a text adventure game. Last night i got dnd simulated combat to work with mutiple combat options, a tracker for enemy distance and it works with three simple classes. Granted its mostly a bunch of id statements and my code is ugly, im still proud of it.
My question, after all this text, is regarding what I should do moving forward. Obviously I plan to finish the book and I've broken down the .Net project into phases so I can more easily take it on in steps. 
What other languages or frameworks in the future should I learn or should I focus on c# and do other projects.
If so what kind of projects would stick out a little on a portfolio.",0

This sounds like a good approach, but I feel like there should be some visual design step in the middle somewhere, where I can create a prototype of the app using Figma or something similar before jumping straight into development.  
  
So, I'm still a little unsure of how to start this. I've got an understanding of what I want the app to do, I have a tech stack in mind (I'm thinking MERN, just because I'm most familiar with React), and I've started working on the frontend code.  
  
For those of you who have successfully developed web apps, what is the best course of action? Did Chat get the process reasonably correct? Where should visual design come in?

Not knowing data structures/algos limits your ceiling,"I think this sub heavily downplays the importance of data structures/algorithms and using sites like leetcode.

JavaScript Exam on february 2. - is it enough time?,"Hey guys,  
in about 10 weeks, I have my exam at university in JavaScript. I'll have to code a some SVG Animations and a simple website. Something like tic-tac-toe.  
Currently, I almost know next to nothing about coding.  
Are 10 weeks daily studying (2-4 h) enough to make the exams?",0
Are there people who just can't do it?,"I must admit, I am not spending 8h a day coding, because I do not have the time. I work full time, and I'm also in college (I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Business Information Systems, but we don't have any programming subjects in the first semester of the first year, so I haven't started to do programming for college). So my time spent coding is pretty limited because of that (about 1-2h a day) and there's no way for me to quit my job or even transition to part time because then I couldn't afford the costs of living. So, as limiting as it is, I try to learn little by little every day, with more time invested during the weekends. 

I don't know whether this is the cause or it's something else, but I feel like I am not progressing at all. I feel like my knowledge has pretty much stagnated for the past 6 months, and even the things that I used to know seem like a blur now. I started learning 2 years ago but haven't gotten into it very seriously until one year ago. Along with the individual coding, I am also volunteering as a frontend developer for a startup, so I feel like I should be getting somewhere, but instead I feel like I know less and less every day. My problem solving skills are getting worse, and nowadays I don't even know how to implement a solution from chatGPT anymore so I have to ask other people for help on Discord or Reddit. 

Without rambling too much, do you think there are people who just cannot do this, even with the right tools and even if they learn and try to improve? I know CS isn't for everyone but I'd consider myself more tech-savvy than the average person and I thought I wouldn't be struggling so much but here I am. When do you know it's time to give up?",0

I need help to decide on whether to quit my bachelors or not.,"Hello guys. I need your perspectives as to what to do. A bit of context:

I'm 3 months in my local scientific-technologic bachelors. It lasts two years, and our subjects are very sparse (maths, physics, english/spanish/\[local langauge\], coding, industrial technology, philosophy, psichology, P.E, and 1 extra subject to discuss class-related stuff, once a week).

I want to do software dev, and the only relevant thing I'm learning is Python. The thing is, my coding teacher doesn't really know how to program. She is ""learning alongside us"", in her words, and the pace of the class is really, *really* slow. I could learn much faster by myself.

Aside from coding, everything I do is unrelated, and I feel like I don't do anything in half of my subjects, and in the other half where I do something, I feel unfulfilled, thinking that it's pointless.

This has been to a point where I'm considering 3 different options:

1. Cope, seethe and persist for this and the next year.
2. Leave bachelors and pursue another bachelors. I've caught my eye on a couple online ones, where the curriculum is much much closer to what I want to do. [Here](https://www.onlinestudies.com/institutions/amsterdam-tech/bachelor-of-science-in-software-engineering) and [here](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-computing-it-q62). (They're 3 or 4 years long)
3. Leave bachelors entirely, spend a year or two learning everything I can self-taught, maybe even do a bootcamp, and then search for jobs to build experience while I build a portfolio of my own.

I'm very indecisive, and I want to take the best decision. I don't want to regret more than I do by doing my current bachelors, but now that I'm in, quitting it would mean that I lose a year of progress.

Learning Mobile Dev with Dart and Flutter,"Hey guys and gal,

I'm a developer of (let's just say) senior years.  

My core skill are C/C++/C#, predominantly on Windows, \*nix and even some OS/390 (years ago!!).

Around a year ago I bought an M1 Mac and started learning Flutter.  For those who are not aware Flutter is Google's relatively new framework for rapid development of mobile apps.  In fact, it can be used to write apps for pretty much every platform; iOS/Android/Linux/MacOS/Windows, even Fuschia!

I'm a big fan of Flutter.  It's quick to develop and uses a pretty easy to learn, statically typed, language called Dart.  I would not say I'm an expert on it but, I'm proficient, with my first mobile app going live next week.

Anyway, I thought I might try my hand at teaching and giving something back to the community.  I was considering starting up a Twitch stream whereby I can hopefully assist and teach core skills.

If you are interested in this, please let me know.  I can set something up.",0

Question about LLVM and importing modules,"Hello,
I would like to know how can I easily import an entire llvm module into my current one.I'd like my import system to just import a file (for now it's an absolute path, it doesn't matter) which would result in invoking an instance of the compiler (class/function/etc) and give me an `llvm::Module`. The question is, how can I copy the contents of the resulting module into some other one?

I've tried to look into `llvm::CloneFunctionInto` and `llvm::CloneModule` (found it just now https://llvm.org/doxygen/CloneModule_8cpp_source.html), but that's not what I'm looking for, or at least I don't know how to use it and if it will suit my needs.

When do you burn down what you've built and start from scratch?,"I'm pursuing a CS degree and in my 3rd semester I'm doing Data Structures and Algorithms with C++. Where I pretty much sailed through my first two semesters with Python and Java, this semester has been tough because I find myself sinking way more time into labs. Like 10-15 hours on each compared to maybe 3-5 in previous semesters.

This is largely because I'll get like 90% of the way through the lab and then spend like 6+ hours trying to squash one annoying bug or issue. A lot of times I think to myself, ""I should just rewrite some of this from scratch"" but I always get paranoid that I'll just dig myself into a deeper hole. Meanwhile, especially with C++, it's often some seg fault issue so I think to myself: ""It's dumb to rebuild everything, you just need to fix some pointer somewhere, it shouldn't be that hard.""

Of course on the third hand, trying to squash a bug sometimes you end up making changes elsewhere that weren't actually the problem, but then become a new problem. (That's pretty much what happened to me today, one of my earlier ""fixes"" became a new problem source that \*looked exactly the same as the old problem\*. Argh.)

Anyway: question is, how do you seasoned programmers approach this issue? Or do I just really need to work on my debugging skills? (Side question: any tips for debugging C++? I find it's error messages either vague and not always helpful, or too verbose.)",0
My lopsided education has me feeling less than confident,"I graduated college 14 years ago (good lord, has it really been that long?) with a degree in computer science. But I learned next to nothing in my course. Between bad teachers, bad learning skills, laziness and procrastination I simply did not gain the skills and knowledge I need. But I had been learning programming for a few years before college from online resources and books. So despite my bad education I managed to secure a job as a programmer for a big company and have since moved on to another job where I'm handling their qa automation framework. I have also spent a lot of time doing hobby games development.

But I can't help but feel out of my league when I hear REAL developers talking. My debugging skills are trash and I feel my understanding of anything below surface level must be lacking.

The problem is I don't know what I don't know and I have no idea how to fill the gaps in my knowledge. I feel like the ideal scenario would be taking a test on everything I SHOULD know so I can work on my skills from there.. I imagine such a test exists right?

"Library, language, and host choice for poll web app with multiple users?","I'm a data guy dipping my toes into some web dev stuff, so forgive me if I am using any incorrect terminology.

I want to build a web app that allows 3-10 users to vote on a poll, and then display the results once all users have voted.

My understanding is that I would need a client-server system where each client sends their vote to the server, and the server sends the result back to each client once it has received all the votes. Is this a sensible approach?

I am somewhat familiar with Python Flask, but I have only used it to create simple web apps that have no interaction between users. Is it possible to use Python and Flask for this, or would something else be better suited, such as Django or JavaScript + Node.js?

Help! I feel lost,"Okay so, I suck at learning. I'm 23, and been trying to code since i was 14 but each time i gave up after learning the syntax because going through frameworks, documentations all that just went through my head.

Couple months ago i learnt sql but I forgot it and have to go through al over again, i dont know why. Is it because my memory sucks or the lack of doing anything after learning it

Since a month, I have been diving deep into python. I learned the syntax again, there's still couple things in oop i cant wrap my head around. I tried to learn django but it made me so depressed cause its so difficult to comprehend for me

Now im trying to learn flask but theres jinja that i have to learn, theres some things in oop as well as how to use sqlite to create products. 

I must mention that I dont get to practise much because I have no idea of what projects i can make with just plain python, i dont even know how to work with sockets properly.

The tutorials I find on youtube half the time they suck, and documentation includes things I don't even know what they are.

Can somebody please help me out in any way you could, i feel like a kid who cant walk without someone holding his hand.

It just makes me so depressed and feel like a loser",0

Is this rest controller thread safe in spring boot?,"So I have a rest controller annotated with RestController. Inside the controller there is an endpoint that checks if a record exists in a mongodb collection. If it exists we make an update, if not it creates a new record with a new ID. So this controller calls a service which then calls a helper method that looks like this:

    @Overridepublic boolean getAcknowledgementStatus(String product, String guid, Integer noOfDaysRemaining) {
        ReminderAcknowledgment acknowledgement;
        Optional<ReminderAcknowledgment> ack = acknowledgementRepo.findByProductAndGuid(product, guid);
    
        if (ack.isPresent()) {
    
            acknowledgement = ack.get();
            acknowledgement.getAlerts().stream().filter(a -> a.getDays() > noOfDaysRemaining).forEach(a -> a.setToggle(false));
    
        } else {
    
            acknowledgement = ReminderAcknowledgment.builder().vin(vin).guid(guid).alerts(getDefaultAlerts(noOfDaysRemaining)).build();
    
        }
        // Find current day's record
        Optional<TrialAlert> alert = acknowledgement.getAlerts().stream().filter(a -> a.getDays().equals(noOfDaysRemaining)).findFirst();
    
        acknowledgementRepo.save(acknowledgement);
    
        return alert.orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException(""Unable to find acknowledgement with the given day"")).isToggle();
    }

&#x200B;

If two requests are simultaneously made to this endpoint and both requests sends the same product/guid pair that does not have a corresponding record in the mongo collection wouldn't it be possible that two duplicate records could be inserted in the collection? I say this because lets say these two requests are being processed concurrently and thread 1 executes this statement:

`Optional<ReminderAcknowledgment> ack = acknowledgementRepo.findByProductAndGuid(product, guid);`

And before thread 1 can execute the statement that saves the acknowledgement thread 2 also executes the statement above. So by the time thread 1 and 2 execute:

`acknowledgementRepo.save(acknowledgement);`

It will save two records because when both threads looked for an existing record neither would have found one so the ID property would be null for the acknowledgement created in the else block, and when this is the case the save method creates a new entry and does not update the existing one. Anyways I have situation where I am finding duplicate records with the same product/guid pair. There are probably a couple million records at least but there are maybe around a 100 duplicates. So I was thinking the scenario I am describing above might be the issue. Anyone have other thoughts or know more about how requests are handled concurrently? If I made this method synchronized or used a lock would it help solve this issue?",0

Trying to integrate ChatGPT with iMessage and Calendar,"Hi everyone, looking for action steps on my personal project.

Create a software that allows me to interact with ChatGPT via iMessage. iMessage important so that chatGPT can ‘text’ me and it feels like a friend is texting me right before I sink into a YouTube spiral.

How do I made an Kaprekar constant in Java? [Imcomplete code below],"Hello, everyone. 

Today I want to ask how I can made an Kaprekar constant in Java. 

As you can see below, it's not like I've made much progress either 😅

And I'm blocked lol

Here the thing is, I know how to println the last answer and order the numbers at the end. But the thing that I don't now is order the numbers in descendant and ascendant to subtract it. I know I should use another loop in another function. But idk exactly what should I put in that for. 
Also, I need to do a function that determine that if the iterations continue until you reach the number 6174 (which is the end of Kaprekar), the program stops. This is easy tho. It's just doing an while (x != 6174) and that's it.
Also, the maximum number of steps allowed to reach Kaprekar should be a maximum of 7. Cannot pass this iteration. 

Idk, hope that some programming Java chad here knows how tf this can do it.

Also, Please explain to me the simplest way to do this. I'm ""new"" programming. Specially in Java. The most I have seen is even the arrays and that's it. Nothing more complex. Just a beginner.

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            x = sc.nextInt();
        }

Web Dev First Timer: How do Backends work with Web Hosts,"# How do I prep a website, pre-launch, to work with my web host?

There was a helpful archived question related to this already but it didn't help my particular situation. I've got several questions, and I'm surprised that I have not been able to find clear answers to them because they seem like pretty fundamental stuff.

# What I'm Up Against

My dad is a farmer. His business is growing, and I want to help by making him a website. So I am trying to get something functional off the ground as quickly as possible (3-6 months?) without it being too janky.  I'm a professional data engineer, so I'm very familiar with SQL and Python. I know a bit of C# and I'm working through a Pluralsight course on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which is all very easy and straightforward so far.

Now let's suppose the front end was completely ready (it's not but it will get there soon). To launch, I know I need a domain from a registrar and a host. At the moment I'm looking at GoDaddy for both of those things. The free alternatives are great for learning, but I want my dad to have a fully functioning, professional website with (hopefully) lots of traffic and orders.  


As an aside, I'm doing this myself, rather than using something like Wix or WordPress because I'm hoping to expand my career beyond data and into web and software development, and this would be something that I could put on a resume/portfolio that will help me get my foot in the door.

# Specific Questions

I get that these are big questions. I'm not looking for full answers here, I just need to be pointed to the resources that will give me the answers. When you are new to something, you often don't even have the vocabulary to ask a good question. So even if you just say ""Google \_\_\_\_\_\_\_"", that will be helpful if I've never heard of that thing before. Links are nice too, and as I stated above, I've got Pluralsight, so If you know a good Pluralsight course, let me know. Surprisingly, when you search ""website back end Javascript"" in Pluralsight you get a million results, some of which I know to be useless for me, and others I've never heard of before, and therefore can't judge if it will be useful or not.

# How Do I Handle User Accounts?

I mean, I know I have to set up a backend, no problem, I'm a data engineer. But I don't know how that works with a web host. Do I have also to set up a cloud database like on Azure or something? Or does the hosting service allow that kind of thing?

For instance, let's suppose I go with GoDaddy for hosting. They say I have so many GBs with my plan,  but is that space limited to just the front-end pages, or can I set up a Database there? And how do I go about doing that? What do I need to do right now - before buying the hosting account - to prep the website so that when it eventually launches, all of this stuff is ready to go? How do I test this stuff in development in a way that is secure, and doesn't expose the website, or the company, to malphesence?

# Now That I Have a Backend, How Do I Handle Security?

I assume this involves setting up a service to interact with the database without allowing the webpage to see what's going on, but I'm still pretty new to this, so I'm not sure how it all works. I keep reading about MVC MVVM and the like. I get the concept, but I need specifics on implementation.

# Do I Need a Web Commerce Service?

At the moment, we aren't even going to be selling online. Just displaying products and information for people to come purchase in person. But we will certainly want to include e-commerce at some point. Do I <i>have</i> to use some third-party service to handle transactions, or can I set it up myself using APIs and such? Again, just letting me know what keywords to look for would be helpful.

# Am I Dumb?

Are you reading this and thinking, ""This guy has no clue what he is doing and is going to crash and burn!"" Please let me know if I would be better off abandoning this project and just using a Website builder. As I said, I have reasons for wanting to do it myself, but If it is clear to you that I'm in over my head, I might need to cut my losses and start on a less ambitious first-time project.",0
Doing a BS in CS/SWE after a BS in EE.,"Hello Everyone.

I'm based in Australia and graduated with a BS of EE in 2020. I have been working at a very small company for the past few years, but I feel like I haven't been taking my career seriously. I realised that I didn't really enjoy EE when I was studying it at uni, but I pushed on because I was already a year or two into it. You could say that I was just studying to get the grades. The job that I have now is very niche and I don't feel confident that I'll be able to transfer my skills to anything else in the industry without starting at an entry-level/junior role.

I have been doing a lot of reflection on myself and my future goals, and have realised that a CS/SWE career might be for me. I did an introductory course in C++ and MATLAB back in uni, as well as a bit of basic Arduino and Raspberry Pi coding at my current job. I have found these small experiences with programming very enjoyable and I could see myself pursuing it further. I have started my journey to do the self-taught method. But I am feeling overwhelmed and think that I would prefer to follow a more structured and rudimentary degree.

I know a lot of people will probably argue that going down the self-taught or bootcamp method would be better, but I'm curious as to whether anyone else has gone down the CS degree option (especially if you already have a degree in engineering).

The reason I'm considering the CS degree route is because for me personally it feels like a clean slate. There is something exciting about starting from the bottom again. I feel that I'll be much better equipped going back to uni now than I was back then, as I've matured with age and I'm more focused. I also believe that I could make some friends, and network while I'm at uni. This is all at the cost of 3 years and an additional ~$30k AUD of student debt, but it seems like a small price to pay relative to the lifelong (35+ years) career ahead of me.

Some questions on Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"Hi everyone, total coding newbie here,

I am working on a Twitter sentiment analysis project on long COVID for my school using Python and I had some questions on how to get started:

1. My first goal is to retrieve Tweets relevant to long COVID. I understand that the Free tier of Twitter API will not allow me to do this, but which tier would I have to purchase instead? I would like to search for Tweets posted anytime in the past, not just 7 days prior. 
2. Is there a way to obtain access to API for free through my affiliation with a university? I have read some things online about applying for academic research access, but I cannot find any information on how to apply. 
3. Does anyone have any up to date tutorials on Twitter sentiment analysis? It seems like most of the papers I've read online are outdated due to recent Twitter changes, code is outdated, etc.

Many thanks in advance ",0
How do I push through coding and apply what I've learned,"I'm going to be honest with myself. I see coding as a means to an end rather than an intrinsically rewarding experience in and of itself; I can push through the endless programming tutorials, constant error messages, and frustrating formatting issues as long as I'm working on clear and easily defined projects that interest me enough to bring them to fruition, like the various front-end components of a website. There are probably programmers who love opening VS Code every morning and typing out thousands of abstract lines of code for the heck of it, and I sincerely envy them for their drive and passion, but I'm simply not one of them. I eventually want to work for a web development company, where I won't be given any choice regarding the projects that I must undertake, but as a complete novice, I'm currently trying to apply what I've learned in ways that aren't mind-numbingly boring. I've created a static blog website with HTML and CSS, dedicated to summarizing and critiquing my favorite games, but I'm losing steam after finishing a single page of it. I know the basics of coding in JavaScript, but I don't know how to meaningfully incorporate into my pages; I can create buttons, forms, and alerts that execute various functions, but I don't see how they can add much value to my site. I'm thinking of adding a comment section, but that might require an in-depth look at PHP and a third-party application of some kind.

TLDR: How do I teach myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other languages without boring myself to death? What engaging projects and features could I work on in order to apply what I have learned?

"Is Git superior for managing VBA projects, and if not, what is best practice?","I have a \~10,000 line of code VBA module which works across Excel, Word, and Outlook.

I have looked into learning Git to better handle version control, but it seems to be considered a bit of a pain for VBA, both for running the code on an on-going basis and for pulling/pushing - seems to require using add-ons etc.

My issue is that I dont want to build out an entire notification service, as the amount of infra and 
time it will take to integrate with every provider would take precious time away from the core value add of the app. 

There are numerous complexity with third party notification channels:

- auth 
- api compatibility 
- idempotency and message delivery
- message formatting
- scaling

All I want to do is add an API call to the app where the user can configure their notification channel, when they want to receive the notification and then the third party takes care of the rest. 

I know of Svix, but they only support one type of notification service.

Question About What To Learn After C,"Hello All, 

I'm self-taught, have been programming on and off for years and started taking it seriously just over a year ago and have been studying every day since. I started by bouncing around from technology and domain for a few months before finally settling on C and have been using it for maybe six months. Learning another programming language is no replacement for continuing to build a solid foundation, which is what I intend to do, but I've lately been mulling over learning another language. I really enjoy using C but I'd like to not have to roll my own everything every time, and I think it's time to expand a little bit - My question is as follows: 

I am looking for a performant language with a moderately large standard library which will have the largest set of use cases in the most domains. I'm currently thinking of C++ (Completely different language, I understand) given it checks all of those boxes, but have read that learning C++ as a C dev or vice-versa can be troublesome. My interests are application development, embedded, back-end, Gnu/Linux, and OS development. I'm also considering Rust or Go which are both exciting technologies, but it appears I would be able to pick up C++ more quickly than rust and it would open more doors. The alternative is to learn a scripting language like Ruby, which I've been using rspec for testing. 

What does everyone here suggest? Any thoughts or ideas are welcome. Right now I'm just studying DSA and writing as much C as possible.

Note: I am not a student - I'm self taught, 30yo, with plans to go back to school for CS this spring (dropped out due to health reasons before declaring a major last time). I don't know how that might change consideration of the question.",0

The best cost-effective solution for reading files from the database(firebase) to the App,"Hi all, trying to make an app and eventually release it to Appstore, but have a question: My app is a similar style to an e-commerce app, but instead products can be displayed with a 3d model to the users. What is the most cost-efficient way to store these files for the app to read it?

Here are some assumptions:

\- A file representing one 3d model is a few mbs (<10 MBS), **the model file representing a particular product is static.**

\- Usually, there are around 10 products (10 3d models) in the app at any given time, Release of ONE new product and removal of ONE old product is expected every month

\- There are two operations regarding these 3d models. 1) A GET all models function which will display all 10 models to the user when they load the home page 2) GET one model function when the user clicks into the details page of the product.

\- Users who downloaded the app can view these models without logging in.

My Goal is to minimize the read requests numbers and egress (file downloads) in my db (Firestore and cloud storage). What are some possible things I can do to accomplish this? I don't want to wake up and find out my bill is 100k... I have read some articles:

1. Store these 3d model files locally on the app, no costs but everytime I want to add a new product I need to change the codebase and re-release the app.
2. use local caches. Cache the file locally, fetch when  relogin or new updates from db or fetch every 8 hours or so.
3. Do something with the UID of the user everytime it makes a request to firebase, like rate limit the number of requests based on the uid per hour. But this won't work because user can see the models without logging in?
4. (In Firebase) - set some security rules [https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/basics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/basics) on the table, check the request interval from the user each time each call is made to firebase
5. Appcheck: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check), but this only prevents malicious attempts.

Am I missing something? Please let me know the most efficient way to do this. THanks in advance.",0

Need help with printing SQL query in Java with ant (Java application),"I'm not at my computer right now and typing this on my phone. If this is to difficult to understand I'll delete and retype once I'm at my computer.

For one of my last assignments I need to read data from two different tables in SQLite and print them to console. The tables are artist and albums. There are three different forms I need to print. One is all the artist in descending order. All the albums in descending order. Then artist and their albums in descending order. I already have the first two complete. I have a class for the artist to create the object and save it to an array list. I have the same thing for album.

I have the SQL statement that creates the correct output I need. However, the example shows artist and their albums are indented over. 

When looking at the SQL the artist and album share the same artistID number. I feel as if I'm supposed to save the data using the ID number for placement in a new array list. I believe I'm supposed to use a while loop and a if statement in order to match the artist and album by artistID number. The thing is I can't figure it out in my head how it's supposed to be wrote out. 

Any advise would be welcomed.",0

"Seeking suggestion to improve my first ""serious"" basic program","Hello, I made a calculator with c++ (pretty basic stuff), and I edited the code so many times to add new functionalities that it's unrecognizable, anyways, I'm seeking to:

1. Find a way to implement square roots (all it does for now is taking in input only 2 numbers, and doing sum, subtractions, moltiplications, divisions and exponentiations). It also checks if all the inputs are of the right type, if they are not it shows an error message and keeps asking for correct input.
2. To start thinking about how to solve point 1, I need to remove the lack of choice of how many numbers you can input in the calculator, so that it can take more than two addends, without having to declare many variables. I thought that maybe it could be done with arrays, but I am still not sure.
3. Remove the limitation of having to select only one operator, thus unlocking the possibility to ask the calculator, for example: 3+2\*(5\^2)-20/4\*
4. Allow the user to choose if he wants to close or keep doing operations after the result, especially because it doesn't ask any further input if the user wants to divide by 0, it just shows an error message.

"Udemy, datacamp, codeacademy, dataquest... where do I put my money to learn data science?","I know people ask a lot about code learning platforms but I haven't found a good answer yet.

I'm a biologist and I want to learn coding mainly for data science and data analysis (ideally from basic stuff like graph making and statistics, all the way up to transcriptomics); I would like to learn both R and Python.

So far by checking several posts and reviews, I have made a shortlist of platforms that seem to be good according to the community but I can't decide on which one to spend my money on (ofc ideally I don't want to pay more than one!). So if you were to choose among these platforms, which one would pick?

* Datacamp
* Codeacademy
* Dataquest
* Udemy
* Or should I just go free with Freecodecamp?

How do I prevent recursion in a Stat class?,"I have a C# `Stat` class, that has the following floats: `BaseValue`, `PercentageBonus` and `FlatBonus`. The final value of a stat is determined by the following equation: `BaseValue*(1+PercentageBonus)+FlatBonus`. A stat also has a vector of `StatusEffect` objects. A `StatusEffect` object gives a bonus to any of the three values mentioned before using a `StatModifier` class which is basically identical to the `Stat` class except its only those three values, and is a struct. So the final value of a stat class is as follows:  
`(BaseValue+sumBaseValues)*(1+PercentageBonus+sumPercentageBonus) + (FlatBonus+sumFlatBonus)`

The `StatusEffect` class is an abstract class with an abstract `StatModifier` method `GetModifiedValues`, which has two inherited classes: `ConstantStatusEffect` and `ConditionalStatusEffect`. 

`ConstantStatusEffect` returns a constant `StatModifier` property of the class, whereas `ConditionalStatusEffect` uses a lambda function property to return a `StatModifier`.

This stat system is similar to games like Genshin Impact or Honkai Star Rail. However I'm facing an issue and that's recursive calls for conditional status effects. For example if a character gets an attack buff that is dependent on the attack stat itself you would add a ConditionalStatusEffect like so:

    character.Atk.AddStatusEffect(new ConditionalStatusEffect(StatusEffectId.Permanent, ()=>character.Atk.GetFinalValue()*.25));

While adding the lambda is fine as the lambda isn't called yet. On calculating `character.Atk.GetFinalValue.GetFinalValue()` (which is how you calculate the final value of the stat), there is an infinite recursion. The easy solution is to avoid anything like this where a stat effect for a stat relies on the same stat's final value, but I feel as though this isn't great, and can be fixed. Any idea on how to reliably fix this issue?

Reconciliation code 2,"Hello I am wirting a code in pyhton where i have a dataframe with a column name ""Balance"" with float data. So some Rows are the cancellation of another row (One rowe has a value an another -value) so I worte a code to do this validation an delete the ones caccellled with their cancellation and just let the ones ""Alive"" but when are more than one with the same amounts it deletes more than one and damages my validation. So i did this:

I add another boolean column named ""Eliminar"" to mark, the row im checking is Balance\_value. and the part that would but is not working is this:

(I take the indexes of all the opposite values)

indices = df.index\[i+1:\]\[df\['Balance'\].values\[i+1:\] == -balance\_value\] 

(And then to avoid error because it is not alive and to avoid a validation of a value it is deleted)

if not indices.empty and not df.at\[i, 'Eliminar'\]:  
df.at\[i, 'Eliminar'\] = True  
df.at\[indices\[0\], 'Eliminar'\] = True

But seems like it is not working anyway it deletes more than one. Thank you in advance.

When i run the code, it prints out '4969'. Shouldn't it  print out '4A6A'?  


Here is my train of thought.  
1. array\[3\] points to the fourth element { {0x47, 0x67, 0x4767}, {0x48, 0x68, 0x4868} }  
2. array\[3\] + 1 points to the 5th element  { {0x49, 0x69, 0x4969}, {0x4A, 0x6A, 0x4A6A} }  
3. (array\[3\] + 1)\[1\] would then point to the 2nd element within that array {0x4A, 0x6A, 0x4A6A}.  
4. ((array\[3\] + 1)\[1\]).value accesses the value member in {0x4A, 0x6A, 0x4A6A} which is ' 0x4A6A'.

Language agnostic books/articles that discuss concurrency concepts ?,"So I had a tiny epiphany the other day - I realised the only reason I really know about async/await in C# is because I came across it while using C#.

"UPDATE: ""About a month in and I only just now understand nested for-loops?""","Edit: Once again I am blown away by the amazing support of this community.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/17pnyx2/about_a_month_in_and_i_only_just_now_understand/).

I posted the above post almost 2 weeks ago and wanted to give a little update for anyone who cares.

I took *everyone's* suggestions, advice, encouragement to heart; I've been keeping at it daily for at least two hours a day, usually more though.

Earlier I finished Lab 2 for week 2 (aka, week 3) of cs50x. This is my first time ever learning *anything* about coding; I'm 28.

I can't tell you guys how proud I am of myself, because tonight I read over Lab 2 and finished it all in one sitting, and in one day, without googling a single thing, for the first time. Usually psets and labs give me *days* worth of trouble. This one I did in just under 2 hours. This is huge, to me.

So far, learning to program has not just taught me syntax or how to ""think like a computer""; it's given me a taste of newfound patience,  improved my problem-solving skills, a fresh attitude about pushing through frustration, and overcoming massive self-doubt. I know it's kinda corny, but I'm staring at my code even now with such pride.

Hopefully I will keep going with it; that's the plan right now, anyway.

To any other code newbies out there wondering if they should keep going, it's never too late to be better or take that next step ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Find your bug and squash it. (Okay, I know some of you are cringing hard at that one).

I have one more..

Learn programming through projects,"Hi,

Implement Multithreaded DFS and BFS in c,"For my OS assignment, we have to implement multithreaded DFS and BFS on undirected acyclic graphs. The input is in the form of an adjacency matrix.  


For DFS, The parent thread has to create a new thread for each unvisited path, and in the end, print the leaf nodes of the graph; the order doesn't matter.  


For BFS, a new thread is created for each node in a level, and the complete bfs traversal has to be printed. The order within the level doesnt matter.

What's the right thing to do when you're stuck while learning something?,"I'm a self taught backend engineer on the process of learning computer science. Most of the times, I get stuck while learning something new (which is obvious).

NextJS 14 SSG doesn't work with top level provider that uses cookies,"Next App Router introduced a new and simpler way to define static, dynamic and ISR pages, which are all described in length [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#full-route-cache), but it introduced some caveats. The one I'm most worried about is top level providers, it is quite common to have a provider for an http client on the top level of your app like react query, and you might need authentication tokens passed in to them.  


The new Server Components paradigm allows us to get cookies in a server component and pass it down to the client provider, allowing us to access http-only cookies, but at the same time, by doing so you just made your whole app dynamic. Why? Cookies are a dynamic function, and by getting them in the top level layout you are effectively using cookies in every page now, even when you don't need them.   


Now, the solutions i could come up with are:  


Top level provider doesn't use cookies, and you pass them only at the request themselves, which doesn't seem possible with TRPC but I might be wrong.  


Multiple providers only where I need them, which sounds pretty terrible, and will cause the context to be bounded only to that part of the component tree.  


I'm really tempted to leave TRPC altogether and just use fetch and route handlers, but the type safety is so nice that I want to know if there are any better solutions. It's crazy that I haven't seen anyone talk abou this at length, I might be missing something because this is really inconvenient. ",0

"Courses are boring, can I just build projects?","I'm a beginner and Kotlin is my first language so I'm doing a beginners course on Kotlin and programming basics/fundamentals.

Is anyone able to figure this problem out? I was told that no one can say they've advanced beyond the beginner stage if they can't solve this.,"Given a single process that consumes from a message queue, processes the message, and asynchronously publishes the message somewhere else come up with a workflow to ensure that At Least Once message guarantee is granted.  In other words, the consumer will consume and process the message normally, but when it publishes, it doesn't wait for an acknowledgement before consuming the next message.  The message queue is persistent, consuming the message doesn't remove it, and uses an offset to order the messages, and we can manually control which offset to begin reading from.  The process should guarantee that each message that is consumed is successfully published at least once - duplicates are allowed.  The problem is to determine how to update the current offset so the process can find a safe place to restart in the event that it crashes, and simply starting the offset at the beginning each time is not an acceptable solution.

Things I have tried: I've thought about consuming messages in batches and waiting for all messages in a batch to be acknowledged before updating the offset and consuming the next batch.  I've also thought about using a heap to sort the offsets and have a callback on the acknowledgement to periodically poll the heap until their offset is at the top of the heap so they can update it.

Need advice as returning programmer,"I studied programming languages in school, but I didn't like it very much because I couldn't understand it well, and basically gave up after school, but I decided to give it a new try. I started with C++ two days ago and I need some advice on how to grasp the basics of syntax and the meaning behind every command/function, decision-making of what to use based on what I need to create. So far I've been doing only basic stuff without a GUI:

* Calculator that lets the user input two numbers and the desired operator, checks for any wrong input (in case of division, it doesn't allow a 0 in neither variables of the two numbers, nor a letter in any operation)
* Temperature converter from Farenheit to Celsius (checks if the input is <32 or >212 and if it is shows an error message and asks to input a correct number)
* Calculation of the area of a circle by taking the radius in input from the user and checks if the input number is negative, if it is it shows an error message asking to input a correct number.

The rest of the exercises I did is not worth mentioning since they're only few lines of code, anyway I want to improve, it will take time of course, but how can I do it efficiently? Sometimes for example I forget the correct syntax for arrays, use the do-while and if-else statements improperly before realizing the correct approach, and lastly I struggle to find the correct order of studying everything, at the moment I am only capable of creating stuff inside a single function (it's always:int main(){return 0;} )

Do you guys also have any suggestion for a manual or something?

"How do you ""extract"" data and information from files like this?","I've was looking around GitHub for repos to contribute to or to see some interesting packages, I've come across this one:

I wanna know (or learn) how people can extract data from files like this package above does. I'm stuck making small scripts that doesn't take my skills to the next level.

Referring back to old code to do the same thing in new code?,"I recently started programming again after a handful of months not programming.  I'm finding I'm looking up a lot of things online and referring to my old code when something doesn't work properly.

For example, I had an infinite Do While loop as part of a menu option.  I reviewed my old code and found that I left out asking for input in the right place in the code.

Does this mean I've lost all or most of my programming knowledge after the break? Or is it normal to refer online and to old code to figure out something you've done in the past?",0

Any ideas how to use a very old C# lib in Python?,"I got trapped in my bachelor thesis:
I finished my research and nearly everything is done.
I wrote a software which basically includes machine vision into an automated storage cell.

But the robotic arm and its control unit is from 1991 and uses a SDK which can be used with VB and C# only.

It's literally the last thing to implement the functions of the old software which worked fine under windows 7. 
Now on windows 10 it doesn't work. It consists of two programs which must run both. I can start the app from Visual Studio but in that case i cannot start the other App. I also cannot recompile the program so that it start on its own (i could not fi d out why). 

I lokked into the .dll and could not find any symbols. But there is an .xml file which describes the classes and methods. 

What shall i do? 

Write a C# program and expose it to python wirh ctypes? (How?)

Write a VB program abd expose it to python? (How?)

My advisor is not a big help although he tries to use a websocket to avoid the SDK. But in that case i fear i have to reprogram the robot.",0

As you can see in code above there is a variable head of Node type it should have ""null"" as a default initial value, Now in a method named as addFirst there is a ""if"" condition after creation of newNode

which is if linked list have only one node then head=tail=newNode and then return.

But if Linked list have mode than one node then how the variable head is not equal to null because initially it is null and we haven't changed it .

Question about accessing and parsing messages sent by businesses for spam management,"If an third party app had the necessary permissions to access the SMS database of a user, which I think is the ""READ_SMS"" permission, and they wanted to access the promotional or marketing spam messages sent by businesses to help users identify and manage spam, is it possible to uniquely identify and parse the content sent by businesses that don't sent these message from proper phone numbers .

I think these businesses use methods such as Long Codes or Short Codes, Automated Messaging Systems and Bulk SMS Services or even partnerships with carriers to send such messages. Is it still possible for a third party application to access these messages and easily parse them as they parse any normal message from a sender with a phone number, or will there be complications.

And if the third party app wanted to filter and uniquely identify these business senders, will the lack of a phone number be a problem in this task?
I hope my query was clear. Thank you in advance!",0

Looking for an excuse to learn C or C++,"Hey all. I have been coding for around 8 years now and I am looking for an excuse to learn either C or C++ because they seem like neat languages that could help me greatly improve my fundamental understanding of computers and programming. 

Some background on me: Professionally I mostly use R to clean, compile, and analyze large datasets. I also do a bit of web development using React.js with Express.js on the backend. I really love these languages, but have always wanted to learn some low-level stuff. However, **I have a hard time picking up new languages unless it's through a personal or work project that holds some meaning to me, so it would be nice to learn one or both of these languages by applying them in my current projects, as opposed to returning to basic exercises such as programming a calculator.** 

I was toying around with the following ideas and I'd love to get your thoughts on whether these would be good use-cases for either C or C++. 

* I run a lot of very demanding statistical models for work that can take anywhere from hours or days to run. I have implemented parallel processing and multithreading to reduce computing time, but I was wondering if there are ways to implement C  or C++ scripts to speed things up further?
* In my React.js apps would there be any advantage to writing some server-side code in C++? 
* Any other data science- or web development-related applications of C or C++ that would be a good starting point?

Thank you in advance for any insights/ideas!

I am torn between learning the fundamentals of Java or CS50 by Harvard. Which one benefits me the most in the long run?

most importantly, what are your experiences in learning CS50 by Harvard and how did it benefit your progress moving forward as a programmer?

Anyone found it difficult to work on open source projects?,"There are lots of articles online for beginners, saying it is super easy and there are plenty of projects for you to choose from, but I found it very difficult. It is not a practice for beginners at all.

80% of the repos are dead, with last opened issue from at least 6 months ago.

Among the rest 20%, many don't have issues for newcomers.

Even if they have, very likely someone else has already picked it up. The number of devs out there is way larger than that of projects anyway, so the competition is fierce.

Even if I found an unoccupied one, the description is only 2 sentences, and after reading it I totally don't understand what it is talking about. The label may be ""good for newcomers"", but the description assumes you are a veteran.

Just one example: [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/113198](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/113198)

No explanation, no where to look at in the code, no suggested fix, only a bunch of logs for you to figure it out yourself.

By commonsense, when you join a company, there will be an onboarding process, which could last 1 - 2 months. That is the time it takes for a coder to start working on an unfamiliar project.

Then why on open source projects it is easy? It will be more difficult instead, because the docs are limited and incomplete, and you don't have a mentor who guides you patiently.

I think a lot of coders are looking for open source projects because they need a job. I am one of them. But for these ppl who aren't experienced enough to find a job, should we expect them to overcome all the obstacles mentioned above?

The solution is trickier than the problem itself.

Working on open source is a senior thing, we should stop advertising it to non-senior devs.",0

Is it a good idea to ask if your friends can become beta testers for a passion project?,"So I'm working on a personal project that I'm ready to commit and at least see it through, but the thing is I can't really finish it or at least have significant progress without getting insights from others, since it involves feedback and thoughts.  

I'm wondering if it's okay to open this up to my friends that at least have some knowledge on this and likely ask for feedback and tests on it.

Ideally testings wouldn't really take much of an effort here (They'll use it whenever they're up for the mood, maybe around 30mins roughly? then I'll send in some analysis and reports based on their usage, and they'll judge if it's close on their end.) but still it would request some commitment and thoughts on their end.  

I am planning to compensate or at least treat them whenever they're free. But since this is just a passion project I can't pay them like a minimum wage kind of thing.

"** Enhancing Heapsort by proposing an innovative strategy that leverages both a max heap and a min heap, akin to the min-max technique employed in double selection sort **","I am trying to propose an enhanced heapsort that would combine the min and max heapify. I got the concept of this from the Double Selection Sort which works by finding the min and max values in the array and placing the max into the last index and the min in the starting index. How do i apply this to the heapsort?   
For visualization, this is what i want to happen:  
Original Array Form:  
\[9, 1, 15, 2, 10\]  
9  
/  \\  
  1    15  
  / \\  
 2   10  
  
Heapsort with min-max combination:  
15  
/  \\  
  1    9  
  / \\  
 2   10  
  
15  
/  \\  
  2    9  
  / \\  
 1   10  
in this part, the second to the last element within the binary tree assumes the role of the minimum, while the maximum value is preserved. Specifically, in our example, the second-to-last value of the binary tree is 1, representing the minimum, while the max heapify is performed for the value 15.  
  
10  
/  \\  
  2    9  
  / \\  
 **1   15**  
here, the 1 will be place in the starting index and the 15 will be place in the last index.  
\[1,                ,15\]  
  
   10  
/  \\  
  2    9  
  
9  
/  \\  
  **2    10**  
here, the max heapify is performed, and min is stay put since the 2 is the lowest value and is already placed in the second to the last index. and then, they will be deleted from the tree and be sorted in the array.  
\[1, 2,         10, 15\]  
  
  
  
**9**  
since, 9 is the only one left, it will be then deleted and inserted in the array.  
\[1, 2, 9, 10, 15\]   SORTED

BCIT/UBC or KPU/Douglas College - Which Computer Science course is better?,"I know; the question might seem utterly stupid at first. It's obviously BCIT and UBC, right? And that's what I thought, too. But hear me out.  
  
I think I am actually getting convinced that KPU/Douglas might be an equivalent (if not better) to BCIT/UBC. And here's the reason for it:  
  
""BCIT and UBC definitely have a better quality of education; that is undeniable. However, programming is not only about learning algorithms and memorizing textbooks/syntax; it's about getting your hands on and actually doing it.""  
  
""Compared to KPU/DC, BCIT/UBC provide relatively fewer real-world practice opportunities. Why? The reason is that one would have no time for additional part-time jobs while attending BCIT/UBC because the institution gives out way too much homework and lab activities. One would simply not have time nor energy for an extra job.""  
  
""However, on the other hand, it is totally OK to have a part-time job while attending KPU/DC because their program requires much lower effort and time. And because one would have time and energy for an additional task, they can get a part-time job related to computer science. While working at the software company, one would learn much more about the whole subject; not just about programming but how it actually applies to real-world situations, what to expect as a software engineer, etc. That would definitely be a valuable experience for a student.""

Where does C#/.NET shine and has it's disadvantages?,"&#x200B;

My background: I'm working as an apprentice mainly using JavaScript (front-/backend and some html/css) for almost a year now. Before that I did a java course to try out if programming was my thing, got to basic algorithms like sorts, game of life, creating a bingo sheet with user input. I also have a basic understanding of SQL and NoSQL.

&#x200B;

For a while now I have been feeling the desire to pick up another language. It should be type safe and have the potential to pick some deeper concepts and understanding of programming languages in general on the go, so i get to know more behind the scenes stuff (which i don't feel so much in JavaScript than maybe with Java) also in order to make picking up other languages in the future easier, if required.

It should also be a potentially strong backend language.

Although i'm not planning on changing my job anytime soon, it should also be in strong demand on the market. It's just nice to know what you're doing is not just for fun/understanding but also increases my value for potential employers.

&#x200B;

Considering all of this, there seem to be two languages left: Java and C# (C# is surprisingly popular in my area, also the tech stack for C# jobs tends to not involve as many other technologies as java).

I'm feeling pretty ready to dive into C# but theres still this question that's bugging my mind:As it's a hobby for now: Where does C# shine? Where can i gain motivation and fun by thinking ""this will come in so handy when building xy""? (Similar to quick and simple in python, fast in C++, universal/scalable in java, frontend/web in javascript and so on)

Thanks in advance for your replies and input.

"Help With Improving a Formula Compiling Multiple Tables Into One, Separated By Headers","Hi All

I've been working on a Google Sheets Spreadsheet for work that will compile sample requests from different departments., and need help with a specific issue I'm encountering. I'd also like to apologize in advance if I'm not super clear at all times; as I need to be conscience that I am not going against my NDA.

First, a high-level explanation of why I am making this Spreadsheet:

I work in at a Biotech Production facility where we are using fermentation to make our product. In a given week, we could have 1-3 production runs. Each of these runs is identical in terms of materials-in and product-out. I create a Google Form for each run, and each Form asks the same questions. Then, I link all of the Forms to a single Master Spreadsheet for that week of production. As I link each form, a new Sheet is automatically created in the Master Spreadsheet, named 'Form Responses 1', 'Form Responses 2', i.e..

Now, because of how Google Form responses are integrated into Sheets, although the answers for each submission are in a single row, the columns might be spaced far apart because they were from different sections and pages of the Google Form. This is fine for me as I am collecting samples, but I want the responses to be more easily accessible. I want other people from the company to be able to look at the Spreadsheet and see if someone else from their department made a specific request.

To get around this, I have another sheet called 'Parsed Requests'. Using the `QUERY()` formula, I was able to very simply parse out the answers to each question in a given sample request from each 'Form Responses #' sheet.

    =IFERROR(VSTACK(QUERY('Form Responses 1'!$A$1:$AZ$51,""Select F,A,B,C,D,E,G,H,I,J,AI,AJ where D='Sample Type 1'"",0),QUERY('Form Responses 2'!$A$1:$AZ$51,""Select F,A,B,C,D,E,G,H,I,J,AI,AJ where D='Sample Type 1'"",0),QUERY('Form Responses 3'!$A$1:$BP$51,""Select F,A,B,C,D,E,G,H,I,J,AI,AJ where D='Sample Type 1'"",0)))

I have the `IFERROR()` in there because we don't always have 3 runs, but I want my template document to be set up to handle 3 runs. So, if we only have 2 runs, there is no 'Form Responses 3', and I get a `#REF` error. Including the `IFERROR()` helps disregard those errors.

The results of this formula is a table for a single type of sample, but with entries that are compiled from each Run in the week. There are 12 different types of samples that we might collect, so I have 12 variations of this formula, one for each sample type.

Now comes the point that I am struggling with.  I want to concatenate all of the samples of all types and from all runs into a dynamic table. Once again, I am using the `VSTACK(QUERY())` to combine the tables. What's great is that I can change the `0` that is the third parameter of `QUERY()` to a `2`. Now, the headers from each sample type table will appear IN the table at the start of each `QUERY()`.

What I want to be able to accomplish is, in between each `QUERY()`, I want to insert a header that indicates the Sample Type Table that is being QUERIED. I was able to accomplish this very messily with the following formula:

    =IFERROR(VSTACK(HSTACK("""","""","""","""","""","""",""Sample Type 1"","""","""","""","""",),QUERY('Form Responses 1'!$A$1:$AZ$51,""Select F,A,B,C,D,E,G,H,I,J,AI,AJ where D='Sample Type'"",0),HSTACK("""","""","""","""","""","""",""Sample Type 2"","""","""","""","""",),QUERY('Form Responses 2'!$A$1:$AZ$51,""Select F,A,B,C,D,E,G,H,I,J,AI,AJ where D='Sample Type'"",0),HSTACK("""","""","""","""","""","""",""Sample Type 3"","""","""","""","""",),QUERY('Form Responses 3'!$A$1:$BP$51,""Select F,A,B,C,D,E,G,H,I,J,AI,AJ where D='Sample Type'"",0)))

This *basically* accomplishes my goal, and if I can't make any improvements on this formula, then the spreadsheet will still work as intended. However, as you can tell from my `HSTACK()` function, I'm simply entering blank cells until I am basically in the middle column of the table, where I then add a single cell of a header. This doesn't look great. What I want is for this header to actually span all columns of the table. Essentially, I want to merge one entire row of the table, in between each sample type, and enter a bold header to that merged row.

Is this something that will be possible using formulas? Thank you for everyone who has read this convoluted post and especially to anyone who makes suggestions.

Bad for SEO? --> Dynamically loaded blog posts via Javascript / HTML templates,"Currently building a custom website using HTML / CSS / JS via Hostgator. Obviously manually posting + uploading the HTML / CSS / JS files of 100s of posts, any time I need to make a change, would be idiotic -- so I plan to use an approach where I just have some kind of central HTML / CSS / JS files that get used as like the templates for blog posts, then I'll just update the innerHTML of one particular element with the blog post content itself. (Something like that). This will make it very easy to upload new blog posts in a time effective manner -- and if I needed to make a change to the HTML of blog post templates, I would just change the one central HTML file (and not have to go in and manually change this for each individual blog post.)

HOWEVER! I've been reading that dynamically rendering text content like this can be bad for SEO / web page crawlers -- as they might crawl the site and not register this text content, which is actually the meat of the post. Obviously the whole idea of this approach is, create content that drives traffic into the website / business funnels -- so I want to make sure I don't select an approach that's just doomed to failure at the outset.

Has anyone had experience with this approach + can speak to the best ways to go about doing this / the best practices to follow, so as to avoid any SEO penalties or mistakes?

How can I see merged changes in VSCode??,"I'm new to Git, and i just tried merging branches.

Which sub-field to pick for career enhancement as a mid level software engineer?,"I am a software engineer with 3.5 years of work experience. After graduation I have changed quite a few companies and as 99.99% of fresh software engineering/computer science graduates I would label myself as the ""generic software engineer"" meaning that I have developed my skillsets in a T shaped way with a slight leaning towards web full stack development but nothing super specific, I've worked in companies from biotech to advertisement to retail ect. Once I had a chat with a senior software engineer and he said that I should pick a sub-field or at least a domain within the IT ecosystem where I will be a super expert and as matter of fact most big companies even if they are not FAANG they have most of the time like 10 openings for software engineer as role and each with their domain such as data, real time communication, web, operating systems, AI and so on, so it comes to my mind that that senior software engineer I spoke was quite right. I am addressing all the mid to senior level software engineers out there with these questions:

  
1)  
Is it wise to choose a sub domain of action where you wanna be the best of the best or it is better to be a generalist and a T-shaped developer leaning towards a speciality such as full stack web dev but still be able to tackle lets say data visualization in python

  
2)

I am in a bad CS program.,"NCC EDU sells curriculum to colleges in third world countries. Students from those colleges pay exam fees and sit for NCC EDU diploma tests.

I am a student at one of those colleges. I am studying Level 4 Diploma in Computing.

This Diploma did not start with a couse in programming. Practically every CS Year 1 starts with a programming course.

The Computer Systems class seems to be a watered-down version of Comptia A+. There is not even a bit of system programming in that course. And the coursework I have to do has a very far-fetched task. I am supposed to write a report to a CEO about updating IT infrastructure of the entire company. It looks very much like bullshit (sorry if I am impolite) consulting task. Moreover, other tasks don't go deep into computer system theory (the curticulum itself has shallow computer system theory and practice).

Computer Network class also does not have any programming tasks. NCC does not teach typical system programming languages like C. It is as shallow as Computer System class. The class has little to no practical lab tasks.

Skills for Computing class also has far-fetched tasks but its teaching materials and curriculum provided by NCC is too lightweight. It does not explain theories behind the formulae very well. The presentation slides provided by NCC gives formulae and example problems for using those formulae. Other parts of SfC are about so-called problem solving. But instead of teaching about real problem solving useful for future programmers , NCC teaches us how to do consulting (not always about IT) tasks for business owners. Wishy-washy corporate speak is the worst of all. There are several project management acronyms but no deep discussions about project management.

The next class is Database class and I haven't learnt programming. This class also focuses on consultant tasks that are too far-fetched. I am supposed to design an entire database system for a business and the course material doesn't get deep into a database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL or database theory. I must remind you that this class lasted only a month (four days a week). 

The worst thing about the NCC programme is teaching algorithms before teaching programming. I am now taking algorithms class even though I haven't taken a class in programming. It is unbelieveable.

NCC provides presentation slides as course materials. They can't go really deep into theory and practice. The teacher who taught computer system and computer networking class has little programming experience and a former network engineer in industry for only a few years. He doesn't seem to understand the course materials. Maybe it is because of his English. Maybe he doesn't understand the technical content. I don't know.

The entire programme from Level 4 to 6 (level 6 is a top-up degree at affiliated UK university) does not has compiler course, data structure class, system programming, usability and ui/ux, operating systems, data science and machine learning courses.

It seems like I will have to learn everything I need to know about Computer Science and Software Engineering on my own.",0

How do you apply an animation to multiple SVG shapes?,"Ok I know if you have a simple SVG shape (like a circle), you can create an animation for it by embedding an animate tag within it.

    <svg>
        <circle>
            <animate attributeName=""cx"" ....>
        </circle>
    </svg>

Now my question is this, what if you want to group 2 circles and treat it as one shape (which we'll call doubleCircle). How do you apply an animation to doubleCircle so that the animation will treat that entire thing like it's just one shape? 

So far I've tried something like this:

    <svg>
        <g>
        <animate attributeName=""cx"">
            <g>
                <circle></circle>
                <circle></circle>
            </g>
        </g>
    </svg>

But nothing happens. How come? I thought the G tag is used to group shapes and treat it as one element?

Also yes, I know that you could just create 2 copies of the animate tag and assign it to each circle. But I am interested in treating the entire shape as one. Just wondering how to do that.",0
Authenticating requests sent to backend with middleware,"I am trying to build a website which queries a API hosted on [banana.dev](https://banana.dev), but I want the requests to be authenticated so only logged in users who have a subscription stored will be able to use my site.

I want to first check the user's ID and only if the user has an active subscription then the request will be forwarded to my API on [banana.dev](https://banana.dev) else the request will be blocked at the middleware itself. Should I use Express JS for the middleware i.e. authentication and forwarding requests? Is there any other better way to improve my project structure? Currently it looks like:

Frontend --> Middleware (Express JS) --> API (banana.dev)

&#x200B;

It is my understanding that I cannot host the entire backend (middleware + API) on banana.dev because it's a platform designed only for  serverless GPU compute. Hence I need to use a middleware, however please correct me if I am wrong

"In a bit of a stump here, classes or should i just copy paste all of this? Using windows forms","Greetings, diving into oop stuff and I've gotten to the point where I think I should learn classes for this, but should I?

How to find a tutor/teacher to learn server/client networking with C++/C in a professional setting?,"The title is long but I would like to provide some background. Will add a TL;DR at the end. 

I am in my first year in a professional career for software engineering. I like my job a lot as it is a very friendly environment. From my experience through college, I learn best with demonstrations/explanations and am good at memorizing a process shown to me. However, there is a lack of experts in certain areas due to the experts retiring before I came. I have been mainly working with simulations, but my new project involves networking with two or more applications communicating as a server client.

For all my previous projects, an expert has helped established a baseline of knowledge as a starting point. However, there is no expert for this project, but it came as a request from a customer that works with our team in the past when an expert was still around.

 From my research and attempt at understanding, our team maintains an existing working application in C++ that acts as a server on Windows. I have access to the code and it is hardcoded to connect using localhost and port 2345. Another application that we maintain is a sim application on Windows that acts as a client constantly outputing data back to the server. There is a third application that also acts as a client that reads the data from the server and organizes it to display to the user.

Everything I mentioned above is simplified, but it all currently exists and working. However, the customer wants the working, existing application that is acting as a server to be converted to a C application on Linux. We already have an existing server application on Linux, but it needs to be modified to add in this additional functionality of being a server that connects to the two clients mentioned above.

All the tools for me to succeed are there as there is documentation on how the server should work along with a working codebase for me to look at and convert. The main issue is that the server also supports other functionalities not relevant for my current goal, so that means there is a lot of classes or files that I don't need. I have spent time looking through the documentation and files, but I do not understand how to properly read networking or client/server code. 

I am still busy with other projects so I have resorted to workijg overtime outside of nornal work hours to learn about it. This involves reading existing C++ code to pinpoint the necessary networking code and converting it to C which I have no experience in. I feel like I can't progress without a tutor or someone pointing out what I should focus on and it has me lost and feeling incompetent. I gave a lot of background to see if there are any tutors or help I can be pointed towards. If anyone is offering paid service or needs more info, please let me know. 


TL;DR: My workplace has a new networking project with server/client applications that work in C++ on Windows, but the server application now needs to be converted to C on Linux to still work and connect with existing client applications. I am new to this area. I feel stuck with my research at a deadend and need a tutor/expert to look at it and pinpoint key information or guide me.",0

I have done a few examples too like, if hisAge >= this, then execute this, Else this, etc. Now I should move to the next topic?  Is this how it is done? Or am I doing it wrong?  Am I worrying too much about practice? 
Or, after I am done with the whole course, and start doing small projects all these will be used and revised then. No need to waste time now. Learn, understand and move on to the next topic?
I am so worried about forgetting things. I have wasted alot of time learning CSS because I didn't know when to stop watching tutorials and revising things. I don't want to do that in JS.
A detailed and clear answer would be appreciated.
Thank you!",0
Where does C#/.NET shine and has it's disadvantages?,"&#x200B;

My background: I'm working as an apprentice mainly using JavaScript (front-/backend and some html/css) for almost a year now. Before that I did a java course to try out if programming was my thing, got to basic algorithms like sorts, game of life, creating a bingo sheet with user input. I also have a basic understanding of SQL and NoSQL.

&#x200B;

For a while now I have been feeling the desire to pick up another language. It should be type safe and have the potential to pick some deeper concepts and understanding of programming languages in general on the go, so i get to know more behind the scenes stuff (which i don't feel so much in JavaScript than maybe with Java) also in order to make picking up other languages in the future easier, if required.

It should also be a potentially strong backend language.

Although i'm not planning on changing my job anytime soon, it should also be in strong demand on the market. It's just nice to know what you're doing is not just for fun/understanding but also increases my value for potential employers.

&#x200B;

Considering all of this, there seem to be two languages left: Java and C# (C# is surprisingly popular in my area, also the tech stack for C# jobs tends to not involve as many other technologies as java).

I'm feeling pretty ready to dive into C# but theres still this question that's bugging my mind:  
As it's a hobby for now: Where does C# shine? Where can i gain motivation and fun by thinking ""this will come in so handy when building xy""? (Similar to quick and simple in python, fast in C++, universal/scalable in java, frontend/web in javascript and so on)

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for your replies and input.

&#x200B;

P.S. of course i tried googling but i failed finding a common consensus on this as clear as for other languages",0

Is my understanding of Dependency Inversion correct?,"This principle states that a high level module should not depend of on a low level module, both should depend on abstraction.

So instead of having this code were a class called Laptop declare and instantiated a field of SDRam:

    class Laptop{
     SDRam ram = new SDRam;
    }

We could make laptop class have a instance field of abstract and and assign an object of SDRam class at run time. Assuming SDRam class implementing or extending Ram interface/abstract class.

    class Laptop{
     Ram ram;
     Laptop(Ram ram){

WPF headaches,"I am attempting to make an app with WPF that allows the user to create an inventory of items and I am getting hit with a pretty major dose of imposter syndrome. Here's a basic rundown of the idea. 

The user opens the program and is met with a menu screen that contains a list of inventories (if they have already created some). There will be a button that allows the user to create and name a new inventory if they wish. After selecting one, the user is taken to a new screen of their inventory. An inventory screen consists of a home button, the name of the inventory, and the items within the inventory displayed below it in a grid. The inventory items display their name, description, and value. It is essentially a really complicated CRUD application. I thought it would be simple but I was so wrong.

I know that's a lot of info. I roughly know how to acheive some of this. Becuase I want to save the data that the user puts in their inventory, I assume I need to use a database. I also assume I need to write a data model of the ""items"" because they hold multiple bits of information. I know that I need to use data binding to make the UI and code work with eachother. This is the issue though; I know WHAT to do, but I do not have the faintest idea of HOW to do it. I have spent a week and a half watching tutorials, and still feel just as inadequate as I did when I started. Before you ask, no I am not typing this expecting you to write code for me, I am really just asking for advice and general information.

I understand the code sort of but can not produce it on my own,"Hello everyone I was wondering if there is a way for me to learn how to get in the “coding” mindset. I am in a programming class in college learning python and it seems like I have a good grasp on the concepts I just can not produce lines of codes without looking up how to do it first. When I say looking up I’m talking Chegg or stackoverflow where they basically give you the answer. This is really hard for me just because I feel like I’m don’t know anything and the people I work with seem to carry me through every project. I have been trying to look up how to do things step by step instead of the problem itself but I always seems to fall back on getting the answers from Chegg. I believe this is because I don’t really know what I am supposed to be searching up when I hit a problem in my code. 

So my questions:

How can I get better at searching up the answers to my problems without searching the actual answers?

I always get stumped at the very beginning of a  project or lab because I don’t know how to start the assignment or even a particular section of code. So is there any way of getting better at that? 

How do I get in the logical mindset of coding?

No CS degree : I want to transition to a mid-sized company after completing my internship at startups.,"Hello everyone,

I'm looking for advice and guidance as I navigate a pivotal point in my career. I recently graduated with a degree in Business Economics and have nearly one year of internship experience as a full-stack developer. I've always been drawn to the dynamic environment of startups, fueled by my aspiration to launch my own business someday. However, I've come to the realization that in order to grow as a software engineer and establish a stable income, I need to transition to a more structured environment.

In my current role, 70% of my responsibilities involve front-end development, with the remaining 30% focused on back-end tasks. I recently received a full-time position offer, but the salary offered was not competitive for an engineering role, so I decided to delay the offer. I've enjoyed the diverse challenges this position has offered, I believe that to truly evolve as a software engineer, I need exposure to more comprehensive aspects of the field.

To achieve this, I've set my sights on mid-size companies, where I can work alongside senior or peer engineers for code reviews and immerse myself in a more organized setting conducive to learning software engineering. Despite applying to a total of 500 positions and securing 10 interviews, I faced challenges in the two interviews I had with mid-size companies.

I'm seeking your insights and advice on strategies to successfully transition to a mid-size company. How can I enhance my candidacy and demonstrate my readiness for such an environment? Additionally, I've attached my resume for your review, and any constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Here are some options that I have:

1.Work at the current startup and study Leetcode(I had solved 150 easy and 50 medium problems, but I stopped after securing an internship.)

2. Continue working at the current startup and engage in projects with other startups to gain more exposure to development.

3. Pursue graduate school.

4. Obtain additional certifications on Coursera or aws

Help with programming anxiety?,"Theres been multiple times when I've put off working on a project since I feel anxious knowing so much could go wrong, and I'd rather not touch it. Part of me knows that even if I make a large program that ultimately never works, I will have (hopefully) learnt a lot. Yet this doesn't stop me from thinking about the worst case scenarios.

For a current example I'm rebuilding our IREC team's ground station to visualize rocket data, and I'm having a lot of trouble using SocketIO with Flask and React, as well as the scope creep that keeps appearing. So much can and has been going wrong since I don't really know JS or websockets, but slowly I've been working on it and it seems to be on the right track.

What's the best low level framework/language for making interactive websites?,"Imagine a web page with menu buttons and clouds in random areas. If you swipe your mouse through the clouds, they shake and drift around to a different part of the page.

When you click on a menu button, a flash of lightning comes from one of the clouds and strikes it.

What's a good framework or language to build something like this? Preferably from scratch?

I know usually in cases like this, it's recommended to use SVG within the DOM right next to the regular button and div elements right? I find them to be a major pain in the ass because of all the rules and prebuilt methods used to work with them. 

You have to go through several pages of documentation to find out how to get them to do a certain thing or avoid a certain problem. And it's also complicated to make them integrate with other standard DOM elements.

Would you recommend I use the Javascript canvas to create the entire web page on that? Including the buttons? Or is that not a good idea? What about JavaFX? Or DOT Net?
