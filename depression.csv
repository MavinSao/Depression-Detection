I’m 7 months pregnant and I’m about to end it all possibly tonight.,My boyfriend lost his job today and that was our only source of income. We are already struggling so bad and I’m unable to work due to how rough this pregnancy is. I don’t know how we’re going to afford rent in a few days now. And we’re both so hungry. All we have to eat is some canned diced tomatoes we’ve had for awhile now. And i can’t stand tomatoes but I’m so hungry. I might try to walk to the panera bread next door later and see if they have and leftover food or something before they close. I also went to the doctor yesterday for blood work and they called earlier to tell me that I’m significantly anemic and have to start taking medicine that i can’t afford right now and insurance doesn’t cover. Its also about to go into the negatives where i live and all my apartment has is a tiny space heater. Everything is just gone so wrong so quickly. 6 months ago everything was perfect. And now i haven’t ate in days and can’t afford toilet paper. I’ve attempted to take my life before but this time ill get it right. If i don’t then my boyfriend has to deal with the consequences. If i die life could be so much easier for him. He could probably move back in with his dad and get a job. He wouldn’t have to go hungry. I wanted this baby so bad but how could i bring her into a world when i can’t take care of her. I considered adoption but my boyfriend loves this baby so so much already and he would never let that happen. She’s just a baby so she doesn’t know anything yet so i think it would be better now. I absolutely hate that im going to do this to her but we haven’t ate in days and she’s probably so hungry. At least we can go together and wont be alone. Maybe my mom or grandparents will have some kind of sympathy and pay for our funeral expenses. I don’t know how that stuff works but maybe they’ll cut her out of me and put her in the casket with me and maybe hold her. I’ll leave a note about it maybe. If you believe in prayers please pray for us. This is the most selfish thing I’ve ever done.,1
Why do compliments make me sad,"Anybody feel sad when ur complimented?
I was told i am such a great person and i brighten their day with my smile. It just made me insanely sad, what is that, why???",1
I wish I could delete myself from life,"Im 23 years old I haven’t been happy since turning 18. Sure I’ve had happy moments but I’ve never been truly happy in years. Everything I do I do to disassociate from life. I like video games and film because for that brief 2 hours where I’m immersed in whatever I’m playing/watching I feel alive. I smoke weed all the time because it helps quiet my mind and it allows me to not give a shit about anything. 

I don’t have a bad life. I’m fact most people would say I’m privileged. I have no past trauma that causes me to feel unhappy, It’s just how I feel. The only reason I haven’t deleted myself from life is because I live in the UK where we don’t have easy access to firearms. That and my mother doesn’t deserve to have to attend my funeral. A small part of me wishes she weren’t alive so I can finally give myself permission to kill myself.

I actually tried applying for the military in the hopes that I would die in war but apparently in the UK if you’re autistic you can’t join the military. I’ve considered going to a shooting range but I feel that would be unfair to the staff. I just want to be happy but I’m stuck living in a world where no matter where I go I’m alone. I am an outcast even among other outcasts. 

I’ve tried medication but that hasn’t helped. Therapists blame the way I’m feeling on the weed even though I’ve made it clear to them that I’ve felt like this long before I ever started smoking. I’ve even quit all drugs including alcohol at one point but that actually just made things worse cause I became addicted to sugar instead. I pretty much cry every single day and even the thought of others being happy causes me pain. I hate Christmas and every holiday because of that reason. For me Christmas is just a reminder of how lonely I really am despite everything I have.",1
I haven't left bed today,"I'm doing therapy. And IOP groups. And taking medication. But I'm so miserable. 

I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt for several weeks, and my hospital stay was pretty traumatic to say the least. I will never go back. 

I've been trying so hard to be happy, for my husband, for my friends, but it's just not working. I know I'm loved, I just think they're all better off without me. 

I haven't left bed all day, and it's night where I am. I've been trying to convince myself to get up for 12 hours now. I just want to end it.",1
I just want someone to talk to…,"I’m currently sat in bed with my partner next to me, I’ve tried texting friends but they’re all asleep. I tried talking to my partner but I’m coming more to the conclusion he lacks empathy and actually gets annoyed when I’m sad and cry.

I’m diagnosed quite severe depression, I would usually ring Samaritans when I’m like this, but I have no safe space here to do so. I just wish I had someone I could talk too. 

I contemplate suicide almost every day. I wish I could just make this pain stop.",1
My close friend attempted suicide," Sadly he was successful in his 3rd try. I have lived with him for a year in a shared house. One night we sat and drank like crazy, around 4-5 am he told me about his issues and one of his attempts. He made me promise to never tell anyone about his issues. It's been really hard for me becuase everyone is asking about what issues he had but in my belief if i tell someone it's a big betrayal. He was 10 years older than me and he was like a brother to me. He planned all of it and sent a letter to the police. But i feel like i could have done something to prevent the event, because he apperently had the same talk he did with me with a friend and then attempted suicide with drugs as far as we know. I think he was also planning to do that when he talked with me. I feel guilty and it feels unreal. I have exams coming and i can't do shit. I don't know how to deal with it. I recently found about my fathers lies and health issues, why my family is broken and the events that caused it. All this is way too much for me. I don't know how to deal with it. I feel weird inside but I have difficulty showing emotions due to past traumas but I am trying my best to show. In the inside i feel like something is broken in me. It feels like i am burning inside but I am unable to show it. Its really hard to process everything, it's really hard to explain even to myself why everything happened, it's even harder to explain my emotions to my friends. Life is too much rn.",1

Please I need someone,"I keep listening to ""i miss you"" by blink 182. I need to talk to someone but can't reach to anyone I know. I just need a friend it hurts so bad.",1
I [37m] don't know if I'm enlightened or if I have completely lost it,"I feel I can sit still in the same place with only bread and water and that'll be enough, and that if I ran out of both, then slowly passing away wouldn't be that bad.

I just want to sit very still, and do nothing. I don't care about anything in this world, anything and I'm not exaggerating. I know this is the first sign of depression but spare me because this isn't my first rodeo and I'm even medicated.

I don't have a self preservation instinct right now, couldn't care less about my own safety. I don't have goals, responsibilities, or attachments to this place.

I feel so weird. Like I'm an actor in a movie and my part of the script ended, but the cameras are still recording and the director is expecting something from me and I'm just there mute and still not caring.",1
My reason for living,"Come to the realisation that my dogs are my only reason for living, they have no idea how important they are to me.",1
The holidays are dead I just wanna go back to the 2000s - 2010s,"When I was a kid we would have it at my abuelas me and my siblings and cousins would run around playing tag or hide n seek and we would gather around the living room watching christmas story, grinch, charlie brown, home alone etc. any christmas classic. Now we don’t see each other anymore we are all working every holiday and having half assed celebrations back then at least in my town grocery stores were closed for the holidays now they are open but close at 7 which is almost the whole day. Nobody is happy anymore or excited and it’s contagious. I don’t feel excited for Christmas because we have no money the only bright light we have is each other that’s all that matters still it makes me so sad that life has been tainted and corrupted I just want to go back to where we were all happy and cheerful.",1
There is no light at the end.,"I recently hit rock bottom again and now I'm struggling to come up with a reson to climb back up for the 50th time. I realized my life has never been all that great. I've always struggled with self image, depression, lack of fulfillment, and just getting other people to tolerate me. Even my family struggles to tolerate me at this point. I'm too stupid to accomplish anything. I already do therapy, exercise, diet and all that but even if I feel a little better I always end up back at this place. Like I just don't see the point in doing this over and over. I feel like this is going to be my whole life and I don't see a way out of it no matter what I do.",1
is it ok to go on dates if im depressed,"i have a couple dates coming up that im really excited and nervous about, and i feel like im ready to start working on my fear of other people, but im depressed. would i be a bad person/selfish for pursuing a relationship when im like this?",1
Urges to ruin life?,"Anyone else get crazy urges to ruin their life? I regularly do crazy things just cause I feel I don’t deserve for my life to get better.

I choose to hang out with people who I know are unstable cause I don’t want to risk being with a normal person and getting better myself or ruining them.

I’ve taken acid for days straight and continue to do it even when my friends say it’s ruining me.

Abuse stimulants and other random shit all the time.

Not sure why I get these urges to do this stuff",1
I don’t really see the point of all this,"The only reason I’m still living is so that other people don’t have to feel the pain of grief. It just seems so stupid sometimes. 

I’m put on this earth just to grow up with abusive parents, repeat those patterns in adulthood and end up with abusive partners only to eventually give up on that, accept the fact that my potential is gone and do what? I go through homelessness as a teen (my mother was homeless and therefore I was, so not my fault) and get forced to live with psychopaths, drug addicts and sex offenders in crisis housing for two years. I’ll let you imagine how that went for a 16 year old girl. And now I am 30, traumatised, mentally ill, uneducated due to life circumstances that were out of my control at a young age, struggling to catch up due to having ZERO fucking interest in living, and I must stay alive so that other people don’t have to experience grief??

It’s so fucking stupid. I feel like I was put on this earth to suffer and then blamed for my reaction and then guilt tripped into staying. Every single stage of my life has been a fucking nightmare. Of course I’m depressed. Nobody would blame me if it was physical pain but because it’s psychological and they can’t see it, it’s my fault??? Why the fuck should I have to suffer so that other people can avoid grief? I’m sorry if that sounds messed up but what the fuck.

“I understand that you’re suffering but I enjoy your existence and your absence would cause me pain, so please don’t commit suicide”. 

Fuck off. If it was cancer you would understand. I guess I’ll just try to stay positive!!! 🤡",1
Pls help any tips would be great.,"I’m currently at the end rn and rlly wanna end my life. I’m so tired of everything,  my grades are slowly falling and school is absolutely draining me. I have lots of physical health issues which makes me feel different from other ppl around me and I always feel like I’m not good enough, my confidence is super low and I can’t help but overthink that  people are laughing and making fun of me behind my  back.

Cognitive Decline,"Has anyone else experienced severe cognitive decline caused by depression? Loss of short-term memory, constant brain fog, struggling to solve basic tasks. I've been struggling with depression for several years and the symptoms continue to worsen. I don't know what to do, it becomes increasingly harder to do my day-to-day tasks and thus makes it harder to change any of the circumstances of my life that are causing me to be depressed, it feels like a negative feedback loop. Has anyone experienced severe cognitive decline and fully recovered? Is it even possible?",1
I feel so numb,"tw: sh

I just want to feel something. I feel nothing. I'm thinking nothing. I just feel tiredness. why is this happening? the pain is better than this. I want to cry but I can't. it's like all my feeling are just bottling up somewhere. I cut my leg just to feel something,  but I still felt nothing",1
I need help,"It all comes down to me needing help. I need help and I don't want to ask for it. I don't feel like I deserve it. I feel like I should be able to handle this on my own. I've convinced myself that the majority of my problems stems from me being overweight. I'm tired, I have no energy, no passion for life, no friends, I hate shopping for clothes so I just grab clothes from Walmart. I have 1 pair of tennis shoes. I hate myself so badly I feel like I'm trying to fight myself and pull myself off the brink all the time. If I lose the weight maybe I'll like myself, maybe I won't be so tired, maybe I'll have confidence. So I bought a gym membership. I've tried at home workouts, I've tried riding my bike around my neighborhood. I just keep quitting and I can't be consistent. So I'm trying the gym now. And I've maybe gone for two weeks now everyday minus the holiday and a Sunday. The gym is fine I hate driving but I'm making myself do it. I'm trying so fucking hard. I feel like the routine I have isn't right. I feel like the food I eat isn't right. I feel like I do everything wrong. I hate having to shower after I finish with the gym. I hate having to eat. I hate having to drink water. Ik I won't lose weight fast. I know this. I just wish going to the gym made me feel better. I wish I had someone who could help me find the right recipes for good food I could cook. I wish I had someone who could teach me what exercises I need to do for me specifically. I've watched so many videos. I've seen so many recipes. I've tried a few two. I'm just overwhelmed and discouraged and crying and I just know in my soul it will never get easier and I'll die alone and sad. And I'll never be anything. But at least I'm going to the gym right.",1
How do I end this?,"Hey, everyone. I'm a 30-year-old male who has been battling depression, anxiety, severe panic attacks, and OCD since I was around 16. I've got a couple of diplomas under my belt, but haven't been able to hold a job due to my depression. I want to improve my mental health, but keep failing. Here's everything I've tried:

&#x200B;

\- Medication (escitalopram, apriprazole, sertraline, duloxetine, buproprion, fluoxetine, citalopram, gabapentin)

\- Therapy (CBT, DBT, MiCBT)

\- Meditation (30 minutes per day)

\- Lifestyle changes (regular sleep schedule, clean eating, high intensity work outs 3-4 times per week, rarely drink anymore, read before bed, socialize with friends often)

\- Microdosing psilocybin

&#x200B;

Despite all of this, I'm still very depressed. I've lost all the excitement out of my life. My hobbies no longer mean anything to me and I don't even know how to occupy my time anymore. It's hard to feel motivated to get a job even when it's not likely I'll be able to afford a home or family of my own with the way the economy is shaping up. Housing prices everywhere around me, my friends, and my family have become ludicrously expensive, the costs of groceries and necessities have exploded, and honestly I just can't see myself agreeing to spend my entire life working for some billionaire CEO to get richer and for me to just barely scrape by, but I don't have the drive/motivation to do anything about it.

&#x200B;

I feel stuck. I don't know if I can bring myself to end my existence, but I'd be a liar if I said I don't romanticize it most days. Anyone else feel this way? What do you think I should do about it? I feel like I'm running out of ideas.",1

I'm numb. everything feels like such a chore: eating, going to the bathroom, sleeping, moving, etc. I want to make it clear i don't want to die. i kind of do but I desperately want to feel better. I've been anxious 24/7 but these past few days depression has been my #1 problem + idk what happened. idk what's wrong with me. i dont have any coping skills for this. i don't have anyone to talk to not friends or family.

I can barely move or get out of bed. I'm so scared + I'm in so much pain. please someone help.

"Not diagnosed with depression, but I don't have any motivations to keep going","19(M), took a leap year because I didn't know what to study in uni... but even back then I didn't really feel motivation to, and not just a lack of motivation on university, but in life overall

I don't really *want* to die. I just want to not exist for a moment... which feels weird, I feel like I'm exagerating things because I live a decent life- yet I'm so tired of life

Most recent nights I've started to cry myself to sleep. I just don't have a motivation or ambition and the idea of having to live for 50/60~ ish more years is... defenitely exhausting. I feel hopeless

Loneliness has always been in the background ever since I was young how do I fix something that feels so intense? Something that makes me want to tear into my own chest with my bare hands  just to make sure my heart is still there? I sometimes imagine tearing my own skin off and being left with nothing but blood and bone, sometimes I want to use my teeth to tear chunks out of my own flesh. How do I deal with this?

There's nothing left that I truly care about and I can't remember the last time I felt even a sliver of joy. I can't talk to people because my anxiety is crippling and it physically hurts to fake a happy face or force a cringey giggle. I'm sick of feeling nothing but fear, guilt, and a raging disgust for myself. I don't want to do it anymore and I don't have to but honestly I'll probably never grow the balls to do the deed.

Doctor Told Me My Depression Is Fake,"Hello Reddit,

Today I had the awesome experience of a doctor telling me my depression was fake. I have been struggling for a month now with motivation, socializing, and thinking positively. I had admitted to the doctor it was mild, but had been impacting my life and has been getting worse. I asked the doctor if I could start Effexor, and that’s when I was told that this doctor couldn’t write a prescription for depression medicine due to the clinic rules.

I felt embarrassed and apologized for not knowing, and the doctor suggested I visit a primary care doctor or psychologist. I told the doctor that was my plan, but most primary care doctors are booked out for months.

The doctor then told me I go to an urgent care and lie to them, telling them I had just ran out and ask for a refill. I was kind of taken back that she’d suggest that, and told her I didn’t feel comfortable doing so.

Then she told me that my depression was so mild, that I could probably go a couple months without medicine. She told me that I was using valuable resources in the health care industry that people with real depression need.

I was so taken back by the comment. How could someone I just met determine that the things I am going through are not real. I felt humiliated. I hung up on the doctor and immediately reported what she said to the company. To tell someone reaching out for mental health help that they are a burden on the system is unacceptable.",1
Many people in my life seem to agree with my views but still aren't depressed,"From family to friends to professionals, people in my life agree with many of my negative views of the world and that much in the world sucks. But for some reason they all still have a positive outlook on life and think you should focus on the good things. I just don't understand how they can not be depressed about all of this shit in life.",1
I realized that my depression actually started when I was 13.,"I remember that year when my family collapsed
 we've never recovered again since then. 

Ever since I was young child, I've witnessed multiple times that everything falls apart when things seemed to start to get better. But there was always a hope but the last downfall, it was different and worst. 

It was slow progress. Since my father's ex wife breached into my home, things rapidly changed.
(He ran away from his ex-wife and his first family. That's what I know)

My family and I lost everything back then. It was the year when I turned 13. We had to move to much worst place. I hated that my parents making a joke about the condition of our dark future. 

Even electricity and water, internet all disconnected in winter. Because my father couldn't pay the bill

I had to hide from my friends that I was in poverty. I played pathetic idiot because of it. I didn't know how to act. Didn't know anything about being social. Maybe that's the reason why all my friends left me.

I thought my depression started this year but it actually wasn't. I tried to kill myself when I was 14. I lost all interest to everything. I couldn't even think about my education, everything in the house was chaos, I felt no hope in my life but I somehow managed to be in the middle that's all I could do. I felt such an idiot that couldn't even have higher score like people around me. 

I'm still idiot. Powerless, useless, wasted. But I hide the all negative emotions and facts to inside of me and tried to get better future. 

But this year, I couldn't handle myself. I just gave up. I used to learn something but I stopped them all. I just wasted my one year and didn't accumulate income. 

I felt I'm burnt out. I betrayed myself by becoming weak man. I ate some foods I want, but it wasn't enough. The core was empty and I never figured it out how to fill the energy again. I couldn't help myself but search my symptoms. It appears I'm suffering from depression. 
I wanted to denied but I don't know. 

I told my mother that I ""may"" have depression but she made me shame for having mental issues. Funny. I had to listen to her complains everyday when I see her face, but she won't listen to my struggles even a one bit. 

She always likes to make myself look privileged brat anyway.

I feel no hope. The more I live, the more dark truth is only thing I get. I shouldn't have been born.",1
Tired.,How am I so tired 24/7. My body is weak and all I want to do is lay in bed and sleep. I genuinely could sleep all day and getting out of bed is a battle I'm struggling to win. I dread going to work and class and once I'm there I'm immediately counting down the minutes until I can go back home and lay in bed. I only work 3 hours it's not a hard shift at all but omg I just can't do it.,1
My life almost ended by my own mistakes,"I (22m) attempted suicide two weeks ago. I backed out and woke up with my wrist slit with six deep cuts on my arm. Bed soaked in blood. I remember screaming which woke my mother. Dazzed she rushed me to hospital where it all was a blur. Have i arrived ten minutes to late I would have been dead. Idon't know know what happend and where I even got hold of a razor blade. Next thing I know I'm in a mental hospital on suicide watch... 

I came home today still trying to figure out what happened. I'm scared yet relieved that I'm still here. Therapy opened up wounds that I didn't know I had. Yet I still feel like something is missing. I don't want to die. I still have a purpose but I don't know what it is.",1
I’ve always been depressed.,"My earliest memory of being depressed and dissatisfied with life is at nursery age 4-5. At primary school (5-11), I dealt with my depression by isolating and reading books in a cold corner of the playground and fantasising about being someone else.

I made sure I chose a secondary school which nobody from my primary chose, so I had a fresh start. Unfortunately, low and behold, I am still a depressive. Secondary school sucked as I grappled with the reality of life and tried to find meaning. 

Here I am 23. Still depressed. Anti-depressants help me cope with these thoughts/feelings, but nothing will erase them entirely.

I truly do not understand how some people are innately satisfied with life. I have an amazing partner that makes my life worth living as much as it can be, but even with my beautiful partner I still struggle with thoughts of “this fucking sucks” all the time. 

I have tried a million drugs, therapies and even changed my entire identity by transitioning and changing name and gender. 

I can confirm none of these actions will ever resolve that deep core feeling of doom and depression. They just provide temporary bandages to distract you from your own mind. 

Good luck!",1
22 year old nobody,"22 year old male
I'm 22 years old and I'm at a point in my life where i feel kind of lost in the endless expanse of modern life. I've battled with depression, asburgers, ADHD, and anxiety all my life, and for years of my life i became a regressing hermit of society practically attached to my bed and tv. i feel the entrophic effects of this over the last few years that felt like a black cloud. I've got no life skills, I can barely read, dull, fat, ugly, slow and my self hatred has grown to a boiling point. I've also deal with common suicidal ideation that shackles me to my room. I've bullshited my way to an associates degree in sociology and imma have to get another one in architecture because I ended up changing geing majors to earn more money and to work with my dad. How can I get a degree when I can barely read. The thing is I have quasi-passions but don't have the strength to pursue them with the depth that is required. I love music, I'm learning a synth but I'm sporadic with it due to depression. Same with poetry. Another major reasons I don't progress is because I hate everything I make because it reeks of me and my limitations.
I've progressed as a whole but too slowly to accomplish my goals and I'm afraid my limitations will drop my off the mountain farther. I want to make music, I want to write, I want to make educational/ personal YouTube videos, I want a girlfriend, I want kids but most of all I want to finally be content with the person I am. I need some life advise, because I feel like I'm lost at sea

I am really losing it,"I can't...I just can't anymore. I'm done. This disease sucks and I don't have the energy to focus on treatment nor do I have the money to afford it.

But I can't die, no no no, I can't. Cause that would break my mom. I have been crying almost non stop for 3 days. I haven't eaten properly, I haven't slept, I just don't know what to do. It hurts so much. Everything hurts. I want to feel safe and warm and taken care of.

I hate this. I hate being this broken. I don't know what to do. I can't stop crying, I can't sleep, I can't live. I feel like I'm stuck in this horrible state and have nowhere to go.",1
I'm about to drive myself off the road,"Hi guys,

I (16m) like driving a lot. I also like driving fast a lot. I was driving very fast today (80-90 mph), passing cars on the right, things like that. I took turns at 70-80 mph and I could feel the car sliding towards the wall or the edge of the road sometimes. I had to hold the steering wheel with a lot of energy so that it completes the turn. I drive a 3rd gen (2007-2011) honda CRV, which makes this even more dangerous. Something that makes it even more dangerous is the fact that it's on the Merritt parkway, which was originally designed for speeds up to 35 mph. 

I do it to get my mind off things. I get my mind off my household, where everyone's fighting each day. I do it to get my mind off the feeling of being alone even though I have friends that seem to care. I do it to get my mind off the fact that I can't get a girlfriend (rejected three times). I do it to just forget in that moment. I drove 60 miles today with no destination just to forget.

I want to crash but not crash. I feel happy with the thought of not being in this world but I also feel sick at the thought. If I don't get this under control, I'll be gone. Help.",1
I feel out of place everyday,"I feel out of place every moment of the day, I dont think I should be there and I feel like I'm constantly getting my head shoved underwater by someone I can't see. No amount of change does it for me and I feel like I can do nothing about it",1
Tired of feeling this way,"Pretty down today. I was feeling okay the last few days but I had a weird encounter with the maintenance man today. He looked at me with disgust. Like how most people look at me, with hate and disgust. Seems like everywhere I go, everyone hates me that knows me. My neighbors, my family, my ""friends"". I'm almost 40 and life is not getting any better for me. I can't find a job. I'm not that great of a parent. I'm in a sad marriage where I feel alone. I don't have anyone anymore but my kid and I feel I'm messing that up too. I can't even enjoy the day because I'm so down all the time. And I can't afford therapy. I keep going in life but I feel like for what? Every day feels so sad and disappointing. I keep having hope things will get better but they never do or never will.  I just wonder what did I do in life to end up like this. I always tried being kind or nice to people but it always ends bad where the person dislikes me or think i'm being fake.  ",1
"crush, isolation, negative emotions","I confessed to my crush in school, and a few days later, she told everyone in her class and my class. Why did she do that? People started to treat me differently after that. They laugh behind my back, smirk while looking in my eyes. People I called my friends... And no one even said that to me directly. But I realized that they knew from the first day; I knew why they treated me like that. People started to avoid me passively. Even the person I thought I could trust, when I asked what kind of rumors were going around behind my back, he said that there was nothing like that, and he said that while laughing, lied while looking in my eyes. I feel like all my shaky social connections that I've struggled to make for a long time just collapsed. And everyone was silent; nobody told me anything. I knew that they knew from the beginning. A few weeks have passed since, and now they also know that I know that they know. But all my social connections are already lost. I feel terrible.",1
"I'm 19 and I've been dealing with depression the past two and a half years, and I believe I might get expelled from my college. I could use some advice, or anything that can help.","So the thing is, around 2 and a half years ago I fell into depression, this started in my final semester of highschool, and when it started, I got very very bad grades, I had to make a global test for one of my classes because I didn't pass it.  
When I entered college, I thought of giving myself half a year to a year to get my things back together (Or at least try to work on myself), but my dad wouldn't allow me to do it. So I entered college, and practically immediatly started having problems, I got very bad grades, I got very stressed out, and even gave up on one of my classes. And then it continued happening, the second semester was the same thing, I got very bad grades and dropped out of one class. Then after that my girlfriend broke up with me, which made things a lot worse. In that semester I didn't pass any of my classes, so I had one last chance in my third semester.  
And this is where I am now, actually I'm in the last part of it, but I have been trying with all my strength to be able to pass it, but I don't know if I will be able to, if I don't pass at least half of my courses, I think I will get expelled, and I truly don't want that. This path is one that I've waiting to be on for more than a decade now, I'm studying for a degree in physics, and I'm truly in love with it, I love everything that I've learned and what I will learn, but I'm scared I won't be able to make it.  
I have nobody to talk about this, I've been keeping it to myself for 2 years now, and I don't truly want to tell all this to my dad or any of my siblings. So I'm here asking for any advice, literally any, even if it's just motivational words, I just want someone to talk about this.

Too tired to go to school,"Hello, 
so I have this issue. I have too much absence a lot of studying to do, but I just can't. I feel exhausted. Some days it's fine, other days like today I just can't. I overslept I'm barely awake despite getting enough sleep and taking vitamins that I need. I feel so guilty, but I just need the time off.

Depressed 24M,"I always had family friends growing up saying your too young to be interested in girls and relationship. I am over exaggerating memory most likely, but remember my first crush as early as second grade (US). As early as then i was always shy about relationships, but more outgoing. By the the time middle school hit every one seemed to be full fledged in those feelings, tho it was at this age something started feeling wrong to me. This was around the time my friends my age started masturbating, and i was still a little behind a few years. Must of been until high school i had really started doing so, but was aware of it before. Because of being aware of it, i had already developed a lot of insecurity and self hate, having a smaller dick, and i don’t mean below average, I mean like (especially now having tries many a times my age) you would absolutely need a toy or its not worth it. I know there are many things worse people can experience in life, but knowing at a young age it’s likely inevitable to find a meaningful relationship (especially as growing older) and fear of being made fun of peers (this is obviously younger age). I have just basically been drinking my life away, for no reason. I don’t really have much more to add, i know there are worse things that people can go thru, and thats what makes it worse

As a note: this has always kept me down but as I’ve grown older - loved one have always said its the ones you truly love (typically referring to their loved partner) that keep you happy, feeling good. How can I continue, when it seems like i have a permanent blocker to finding a good relationship (again, understand some may even be mental in my head, but there are truly physical limitations in my situation - this is not just “oh you’re below average”)",1
Depression keeps moving the goalposts. I’ll never be happy.,It’s like every time something good happens I find a way to feel like shit about it. For the longest time I’ve felt lonely and ugly. I’ve thought that if a woman was attracted to me I’d feel good about myself. I fingered a really pretty girl yesterday and somehow I still feel like shit. Now I’m combing through every part of the interaction for reasons to come to the same conclusion that I’m ugly and worthless. The goalposts moved. This is fucking exhausting I’m gonna feel like shit forever at this rate.,1
I only ever get horny when i'm depressed,"I don't really know if anyone is gonna see this, so i guess this is just a rant? but any advice or anything would be helpful.

I won't mention what triggered the thought, but i notice that i only ever get horny when im depressed, like, i ENJOY sex when i'm not depressed, i will go out of my way to initiate and will be extremely excited to participate, but im never really FULLY turned on, there's always something in the back of my mind saying ""you're not into this, you're not turned on, you're lying to this person"" even thought i'm NOT, i enjoy sex and i never have it if i don't want it, and if i don't want to midway through i say something and my bf stops but like, im just never fully horny. 

Unless i'm depressed 

i noticed it a few days ago when i was going through a weird depression and suddenly got violently horny and *TMI* i ended up masturbating like 5 times in a row.... kinda gross lol but it doesn't bother me.

but it made me realize that i just can't remember the last time i was FULLY horny while not going through a depression, i'm not really sure what to think about it or what to do about it

Do i fetishize my depression? is it my brain trying to give me a seretonin(spelling ik) boost? Everywhere i look online all i see is how depression lowers sex drive, and i just don't know, i used to get horny without being sad, but i just don't anymore.",1
Closure og 3 month,"Hello their.... 
So i'm a college student and before 3 month i had a shock in classes two time as my doctors shouted at me infront of whole class and i literally freezed and couldn't do a damn thing.
 
i stopped atending to classes since then, which lead to failing in one class, after the semester is over, i have been studing for three months non stop, i studied chemistry, C++, calculus and some other classes. 
Sound nice right, not really when you literally don't communicate with any one for three months!!! 
I'm still at shock and the college is about to begin, think about the amount of fear existing in me right now!
I truly need aomeone to talk to, but my only friend feels like he literally enjoys my agony, what the hell do i mean?? 
Well let's just say that he him self is afraid from being bullied in college two since he had been bullied in school two, not like me but he had his share i prosume, so when he see me suffering, he some how feels safe or something i guess. 
I truly don't know how to get out of this, i had many many hard times, i mean i'm a person which his parent divorced after fighting for years, my mom is a foreigner, got bullied in ways you don't want to imagin.

I just want to reach out to someone who knows me and tell them my whole story from start to finish but I don't know how without making them worried for me.,"I (20F) have been struggling with depression since I've been 13 or 14. Went down a road of SH on and off for 5 years (now clean 2 years). And was SA by my first boyfriend. I was diagnosed with depression and in therapy for a few years but my therapist made things worse. 

For a while, I was doing really good. I could function and had maybe one or two bad days a month. Recently, though, eveythings changed. I suspect I have some form of mild PTSD from the SA but have never been diagnosed because of my poor experience with my ex-therapist. Lately, my flashbacks and sensations from the abuse have been becoming more prevalent. I've gotten virtually no sleep in 4 days and am just constantly on edge.

Today, my depression has been horrible and I can't function. I went to class, got back at 11am and have been laying in my bed since. It's now 730pm and I haven't eaten breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I had a handful of fritos and water earlier. I'm so down and I just want to talk to someone I'm close with but I don't know how to reach out/everyone is busy. I just want a friend to talk to me. My partner is busy playing videogames with his dad 2 hours away and my parents are dealing with stuff at home an hour away. I'm all by myself. Everyone thats been wholeheartedly there for me is dead. I dont know what to do. I dont know where to start. It's been so long since it's been this bad. I'm so scared and alone. I dont want to be like I was back then. 

I want to tell someone EVERYTHING. I dont want to keep saying ""oh I'm just tired,"" ""just a little down today,"" or ""it's the changes of the season and the snow on the ground."" I want to say all of the things ive felt, thought about, done. I want to scream. I want to cry. I want to hit. I dont know how I can get myself out of this. It's just building and building. I dont know how to reach out or if I'll get anything from it. I never have. I just want someone to be soft with me. I dont want to be strong anymore. 

Sorry for errors. I'm crying and can't see.",1

I’ve done journaling, antidepressants, all the bs they can give you to help non of it worked and i tried and tired, and i feel like a dick for it not working. I’ve am just in a constant feeling of nothing i’m not depressed i’m not mad i’m not stressed, and it sound corny but i just don’t really feel any emotions. i smoke and that does it’s thing for a little and im back. Im a high school drop out and work a full time job. i don’t have any interests i just wake up, work and sleep. I don’t socialize outside of work anymore. I don’t want to be alive but I don’t want to be dead. I’m just stuck. Nobody in my life knows nor do i want to share that with them, my family is kind of fucked up with there own shit.",1
The sadness won’t go away,"I’m tired of feeling sad all the time. I don’t know what to do anymore. I go to weekly therapy, take medicine prescribed by a great psychiatrist, i have an amazing family who understands my mental health issues and supports my (I’m not married, I’m referring to my mother and family im general).
I thought i’d feel better/happier once I started working on my field. But I started having my first patients last week and even though their feed back were great… I’m still sad. Nothing has changed for me.
I’m so disappointed.
I have this very self destructive behaviors when I’m stressed… so last night i ate a lot of thing with dairy even though I’m extremely allergic to it… and now I’m in extremely pain.
It’s like I’m punishing myself for not being able to be happy like a normal person 😞.
I had very high expectations for myself/my life achievements before i had depression and been diagnosed with BPD… I’m now 30 and i’m not in the place I thought I would be and I don’t know if I ever will be.
I feel like these mental illnesses took so much from me. Things I’ll never be able to get back… especially time. I live in a inside war: is it really worth living if I’m almost sure I’ll never be happy?

Does anyone ever felt this way?
If so… did it get better? Are you happy now?
I just need some hope…",1
"At some point in a long period of depression, the friends you had will fall off","They will get tired of hearing of my/your same tired story. Their sympathies will be exhausted. They will avoid your calls bc they don’t want to get dragged down. They will call you negative, toxic, unappreciative, lazy behind your back. After years, they will distance themselves bc I/you are too much of a mental drain. It’s understandable, really. Given the choice between the general distractions that of life(dinner, drinks, movies, parties, art galleries, etc—things you no longer find joy in) and hearing about how shitty I/you feel, the choice becomes obvious. Then I will be alone. Truly alone. Then what I choose to do will no longer affect other people bc the separation and distance has already been created. Yes they will act sad, angry, and regret not taking the calls. But deep down they will also be relieved because they won’t have to actually deal with this, even as a peripheral thing.  One generally assumes that even old people near death have friends, so any death, really will affect others to some extent. Now, tomorrow. A month, 10 years, 20 years—the time frame doesn’t matter. Unless you plan to cold turkey cut off everyone from your life 5-10 years before your expected ’natural death’. And who does that?",1

I want to have good grades and it's so hard because I get distracted because of ADHD and my parents think I'm just lazy. I feel like killing myself every so often and the only thing that keeps me from doing it is the thought of being successful with a wife that actually cares about me in the future. I just want to be a normal person with normal friends in a normal family living a normal life. I don't even want to have sex, I just want someone to talk to and someone that cares.",1
Every day is a battle! I'm depressed but have to submerge it.,"If someone walked in the door right now and shot me, I would be relieved. I am in such a bad place financially because of a stupid mistake I made. Now I have to battle back from the abyss because I'm too chicken sh!t to do something drastic to myself. Not because I don't want to but I just don't know for sure if it will work, leaving me a vegetable or in a coma, but even worse, alive. I read some of the other posts and feel ashamed that I have felt this way for so little time compared to others. But then I wonder if this is only the beginning? Do I remain in this place? Fantasizing about death was almost a break from reality and my situation. When hope arrives in my ind it requires effort and possible disappointment. Like I said, every day is a battle. Any suggestions?",1
Derealization,"For quite a while now I have been experiencing extreme derealization. I mostly don't feel anything at all, I have a distortion of vision and perception of things around me, I don't really realise what's happening all the time and life just goes on by itself, without me being conscious. I kind of feel like I waste my life because of that, because I can't really be in the moment and enjoy, I also don't feel connected with myself or others. Has anyone else experienced this and knows how to stop it? I would really appreciate some advice/tips.",1
"I’ve(18F) never been depressed really, but i feel like im slowly getting there.","I've been struggling to complete high school since 16. I'm incredibly behind and every semester I just fake my way through or do nothing at all. I want to do it but I just don't. I don't get it. I can't keep doing this I want to go to university but it's like I just can't be bothered. I can't be bothered to have friends. Or hobbies. And the only reason I have a boyfriend( long distance)  is almost accidental.  
I also fear we will break up since I can't seem to do literally anything. 

I wake most days deeply anxious but with little idea of what to do literally. I don't enjoy anything. And just lie in bed listening to music a lot and take lots of naps. 

Being in this situation where I've been trying to do the same three classes semester after semester, unsuccessful is I think starting to make me feel like I have no way to solve this. 

I try not to give up but It's been getting worse and I sometimes feel like I'm basically dead already. I do nothing and feel little. The only strange thing is my mind is alive and I'm quite positive and introspective despite not having a reason to be. In my head I love life but in reality I avoid as much of it as humanly possible. 

What do I do? I already have a therapist and I try to talk to my boyfriend but I feel like they never really understand what I'm saying and I talk to my dad and he always just tells me to just get it done or he admits he has no idea then tells me to just do it anyways. 

Am I even depressed or am I just acting depressed? What's the difference? Does it matter?",1
How do I reset?,"I come here looking for anyone that has any idea how to reset their life and take back control. I have been feeling terrible lately. My job has destroyed my mental, physical and emotional health for the better part of 15 months now, my relationship with my significant other has completely deteriorated and all we do is fight, my family life with my parents and brother is a dumpster fire, and my friends are all but nonexistent. 

I just need something to reset my life and start a new. Idk, do I move away from everything? Quit my job, relationship and friends and just take the money I saved up and leave town? I’m so lost.

I worked so hard during my time at college and was blindsided by covid. It destroyed any prospects I had of employment in my field of study after college. It seems for the better part of my adult years, I have worked so hard just to have nothing to show for it. I tell myself I just need therapy but I work 6 days a week, 11-12 hours a day which makes it extremely difficult to partake in any actual help from professionals.

Nobody wants to talk to me and I’m the most pathetic, useless person I know. I hate myself so fucking much. Humanity is such a beautiful, awful, and organized chaotic concoction. I don’t know if I was built to handle it. Each day I feel myself losing my emotions. I haven’t felt joy or happiness in months. Maybe even years.

Life has just become so monotone , and i understand that the problem lies in me myself, in my unwillingness to change anything in my life , but find myself in a spot where i don't even think anymore about bettering my life , because all my previous attempts at self improvement have just remained just mere attempts. What i am trying to say is that there's nothing to me in my life, no upcomings that feel significant and meaningful (nothing more than just becoming a little better at my craft) and no traumatic events.

The following day, I was pulled over while driving by the police and I was arrested for drug driving. In 2 days I will lose my license and become a convicted criminal. I will not be allowed to finish nursing school and my dreams of becoming a qualified nurse and working in America or Australia will be shattered. I’m so depressed about it. I have a great lawyer but even he doesn’t see a way out of this as the court will not accept my argument. I have a 4 month old baby, he’s the best thing ever but I can’t cope.

This is just one school (uni) but this is insane to me. All i did in highschool was college courses. GR.10 science done. I was going to do trades so i didn’t have to do anything really. Now this? Theres just no way. I dont believe i can do those type of courses, that is next level. I can barely apply myself as is. I got like 70s in college english man. Sure i did good in math, college math 90s. But with adhd it was god damn hard. Asking the same questions over and over, constant need for re explaining. I cant do that at a ridiculous UNI level. I had a hard enough time juggling just putting effort into math for a semester. Fuck. Im so fucked. Now what? God life just sucks. Whats the damn point, shit takes to much effort.

37 and lost,"Hi all I'm feeling really lost in life, been struggling with depression on and off for many years.  Unhappy with my job, can't seem to find success dating. What do people in their mid-late thirties do to get out of the blues and get on with life?",1
"I (23F) just don't have the energy to keep finding new Band-Aid fixes, and I don't know what else to do","\*\*Everyone has stuff, and every experience is unique - I just wanted to post somewhere online to see how this goes.\*\*

TL;DR (*Yes, at the beginning)*   
Essentially, I've been running on fumes for the last (nearly) 2 years, and I just don't know what to use as ""fuel"" to keep going. Treatments/therapies/meds seem like a dead end, I have no goals, and my support system has deteriorated. I know I'm at full fault, I just don't know how to \*not\* make things worse? What next steps or things have you guys tried that have put fire back into your lives? Any genuine advice or support is appreciated. 

&#x200B;

Details and history for context:  
I (23F) have been passed through a few different 'combos' of diagnoses over the years, but to keep things simple I have the dynamic duo of anxiety and depression.  I have other conditions (ADHD, both SAD's \[social and seasonal lol\], as well as SA trauma, severe trust issues from an emotionally abusive environment growing up, and am suspected by counselors to be on the autism spectrum as well. Regardless of the labels, I am just so run down from the continuous mental battles I'm constantly engaged in, and I just need some ""peer"" advice and options. Nobody I'm close with is open enough that I feel like I can share w/o being a burden, and talking to yet another therapist about this feels like I'll just be handed another label or medication to zombify me. 

  
I've been married for two years and he is the best person in the world. I have a common office job that I consider neutral, no kin and no long-term goals for myself (husband is the aspiring one). I've been dappling in religion for the past year (as my husband is Christian) but I still consider myself agnostic. I have hyperfixated hobbies that ""pop and drop"" every couple months (music/craft focused), and am not in a great area to do cool outdoor activities or travel often (the corn part of the Midwest USA that's 9 hours from anything geographically remarkable).

  
Here's my main issue: I feel like I push through the same mental cycle every few months of feeling 'put together' and then plummeting into self-despair and burn out. It's been ongoing since I was 15 (some times are better than others) but I honestly just don't have the energy left to deal with it anymore. The only things that previously kept me grounded were family, friends, my cat and my (now) husband. As of right now, I only have my husband (NC with family, cat just passed, friends grew apart) and even that feels like it's on thin ice. All of my issues have killed any self-motivation, my libido and any sense of intimacy, and I've been failing to meet any and all of my husbands needs emotionally and physically for essentially the entire two years we've been married. 

  
We've been doing couples therapy sessions, individual therapies, I've gone through various types and brands of medications, done mindfulness practices, and am on the list to start brain mapping in January. All medical labs have come back normal. He's expressed his feelings at the lack of a 'cure' but I just don't know what else to do? He's been super supportive but also had a few shows of frustration, sadness, and obvious disappointment (which are all valid). He doesn't believe in divorce (and I don't plan on ever separating) but I keep feeling that he resents marrying me--he feels stuck with me, and that if he had known that this was how things would be, he wouldn't have kept pursuing our relationship. He expressed that ""being stuck in a dead-bed marriage at only 24 is just great"". Since this was shared I've felt my emotional capacity for anything other than ""one day at a time"" is just impossible - hence further complications in my romantic and platonic relationships. It was a hard restart to the beginning of the cycle, and I've been stuck at square one for months :/ If anyone has anything they could share, I'm open to advice.

News I was dreading,So I've got the news I've been dreading for long time now. Dad will likely be gone by the end of the week. I genuinely can't go through this,1
Need to vent.,"I've shared previously that I've been on a meds adjustment of late - I was on 30mg Cymbalta and doing well, very well, then went to 60mg because it's the recommended adult dose, ended up feeling quite bad (headaches all day every day, nausea daily quite badly, foggy and exhausted and couldn't focus on my job), so, I went back to 30mg and because of that, I had withdrawal effects from the 60 to the 30 and well.. it's been a clusterfuck.  I ended up completely and utterly depressed again and last week was like mud.

It's been a couple days, since this past Sunday to now, where I feel like the OG Cymbalta dose I'm leveling at and starting to feel good at, but, I'm just fucking exhausted.  I'm on meds to help myself, I grin and bear it, but fuck me is hard.  I know adjusting is part of it, but the emotional seesawing/mood issues and mostly just feeling soooo depressed and fatigued and now this week starting to feel ok again.. motivated, focused, happy, not feeling anxious or as insanely tired.  Like today I feel great, last night even I was really tired and feeling whack.

I feel uncomfortable talking about this to people I know so .. thanks for letting me put this here.  The constant extremes are just really bloody hard to live with.  I am hoping that 30 mg and my adjusting back to it helps.  The bad weeks really take it out of me (even a neighbour who saw me this week told me I looked so much better, that last week I didn't look alright) and while well meaning, stuff like that hurts.  Because I know how much anguish I was in, and how tired and just over it all I was, and that anyone could tell.. I just hate that.  You know?

To everyone going through it.. I see you.. and I send you the best of vibes.  It aint fuckin' easy!",1
Depression is ruining my life.,"I'm only 16 and I feel as though I should've just killed myself. I reached out for help via counselor and she failed. My mom had been so upset and angry at me. She even claimed if I wanted to kill myself I should've. I don't hate her, she's trying to be sympathetic. I'm afraid of my own cousin. She talks to me any type of way and I'm too fucking scared to comment on it. There's already tension in the family. I'm afraid of my step-dad. I remember the few times him and my mother fought—I was around 14 at the time and I just didn't think and hit him. This has caused even more tension and my mother tried to get me to apologize to him. I remember being up at night because my step-sister cried to her mother on what I done but it was in a very hushed tone. I heard it all and acted as if I didn't. I'm so sensitive so anything could set me off. I'm a junior but I'm ready for graduation. I feel so erratic with these mental break downs, I feel crazy. I can't do anything without my family criticizing me, I'm afraid of them.",1

I have no friends; how do I stop caring about making friends and learn to live without friends so it isn't such a burden to me?,"So I'm a 17 year old boy and I have no friends, it's been like this for 7 years and it sucks and I, more often than not, feel lonely and I want to know how to stop caring about making friends, how to stop being jealous of people with their friends and then living without friends. It's seriously becoming sort of like some shackle that's holding me back and preventing me from doing what I want to do. 

Because I have no friends I either play video games all day or lay in bed and either watch YouTube or videos(p) and eventuality fall asleep to them, to make me forget about how shitty things are, and when I'm not doing those things I can't help but feel sad and daydream about having friends, as I did in the past. I don't want to give up video games because I love video games, they are a huge part of my childhood and to this day I still have a great time playing them. I do want to get rid of my p addiction though, it's not as bad as it was when this whole thing started ((I used to watch p for upwards of 7 hours a day (not all at once but in total) now it's at most 4 on a bad day)) but it's still a hindrance to me.

Since school started again it makes me feel more lonely seeing everyone with their friends (especially my old friend group) having a happy ol' time with each other, giving each other hugs, doing that handshake bump thing, talking to eachother, and doing their secret handshakes, while there's me, sitting by myself at lunch or in class, alone, on my 3ds while listening to music because video games and music reduce the feelings. I don't pay attention in class because I can't go a day in school without playing video games in class because it makes me jealous seeing everyone with their group of friends in class, and most likely later down the line my grades will start suffering like last year (they already are, I'm falling 2 classes); because nothing has changed, I'm still lonely and get no social interaction from anyone, people only talk to me briefly, nothing ever comes out of it, I just don't know what to do with people anymore, I don't know how to form relationships. 

I don't even get invited to do group projects, I always do it alone and then fail it because I play video games or lay in bed all day, then I just smile and pretend that I'm doing just fine when I'm not actually fine. Only my teachers at least say hi to me and acknowledge that I'm there instead of just looking at me or just ignoring me. People just look at me but they never talk to me, I see how many people whether they're a girl or boy (although it's mostly girls) just constantly keep looking at me, that's all they do they just stare at me for some reason, idk why.

I've tried making friends but I'm not that confident, I can never approach people and even if I do I don't know what to say to people and can't keep a conversation going for long. Whenever I would see someone who I tried to form something with and nothing came out of it again, it would make me feel like shit, just a constant reminder about how shit I am at making friends, and how lonely I am, and how I can't talk to people anymore. 

I mean earlier today (and even last week) I think a girl waved at me and you know what I did? Nothing. I told myself that I shouldn't let the opportunity go to waste but I did, I didn't go up to her and say hi, I did nothing. Even this month, in my class, a needed a tissue for my nose and a girl gave me one, we then sat by eachother and proceeded to talk, things went ok at first but shortly after I didn't know what to say and things just ended, I asked if we could talk later and she didn't give a response. Throughout the month we would run into eachother and say hi but eventually she stopped and she started to ignore me.

I'm just tired of trying so hard and getting so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter because I always fuck it up. People say that ""I'm young, I'll figure things out"", or ""I just need time"", but my question is how do you know that? What if things don't work out? As time passes it's not like people will just come to my door and be begging, dying to be friends with me, that's not how things work. Like, sometimes I don't even care where I'm heading anymore, sometimes I just want to lay in my bed all day or play video games all day while watching videos and eventually just rot and die.

I want to go somewhere in life, at least be able to live in a nice 1 bedroom or studio apartment and be able to pay bills without having to worry about it, and then do whatever fun activity I want whenever I want. But because of how things are I can never find the motivation to do anything worthwhile that will get me to where I want to be.

I thank you guys for reading this, sorry if I got emotional, and sorry this is so long and a mess but I just have a lot on my mind. I'm just going through a rough time and just don't know how to deal with anything, I posted this because I just wanted to speak my mind since I've been avoiding that. Also, if this gains traction please keep things civil.",1
Fake life,"My fucking life sucks. Why is everything so damn hard? Why can’t I see my accomplishments? Why is it all fake? My college career is fake, my high school time was fake.

I’m ghosting my bestest friend in the world and it is killing me,"I’m ghosting my guy best friend and it’s killing me

My best friend and I have known each other for nine years now. I initially got to know him as we went to the same school and sorta had a crush on him. However I was far from communicative and became friends with him. We somehow always managed to stay in touch, even when he went off for college and I was still in school! 

However things changed the year I got done with high school. He was in our hometown for a month and I was in the weird space between high school and uni so had all the time in the world. This is when we really got to know each other. We really got close, and ended up crossing some physical boundaries. During this time, I also got to know he had a girlfriend which just broke my heart! As soon as I got to know, I knew it had to stop. However, I didn’t know better then, so I still chose to keep in touch with him. I also didn’t really have as much as a sense of worth (as I do now) and also had zero friends so in my mind, I felt I had to stop this so we could still remain friends.

It really broke my heart though, I was 19! And never had someone like me like that, especially someone who wanted me. I remember it hurting so much. But I went off to university and just went on with my life. I still kept in minimal touch with him, even met him once in my hometown a year after. I was okay then.

In covid, I was alone in my uni dorms and had all the time in the world, so got in touch with him again. This time, we got to be friends differently. I was involved in a situationship and he sort of helped me through it. Mind you the situationship is what actually broke me and left with severe depression, suicidal thoughts and what not. Once I got over my situationship and was single is when he got into a serious relationship for 3 years! 

Last year (2022) he decided to visit me in the country, and was going to stay with me. I thought he was still in a relationship so didn’t have an issue and was going to be okay. However when he came, we got close (again) however this time, he said he wasn’t in one. I guess that was enough for me to hear, and I allowed myself to get closer to him (again). When he left I was heartbroken for a good two to three months. He even went back with his girlfriend as casual friends apparently! I know what you are thinking, wtf am I doing? Ah it gets worse. 

We kept in touch as always, and he again helped me through a lot of my depressive episodes and financial hard times, like I wouldn’t be where I am today, if he wasn’t there for me. He helped and has helped me so much to become a better human and I genuinely do have the best time with him: talking about all things art, music, love.

Earlier this year, I was at my lowest: financially, physically and emotionally. Him and I started talking a lot more (he ended things with the casual/girlfriend). We would talk daily, watch movies together on call, talk for 10 hours straight! I think throughout this whole year, I fell for him again. Or maybe I was reminded that I never stopped loving him? One thing to keep in mind: even though we had been physical before we never really went all the way. We never did it.

Two months ago, we decided to go abroad and meet each other for a last minute trip. I mean, we both were available, single and really excited to see each other, so we definitely wanted to go all the way, however I asked him if this would give anywhere, to which he said he can’t be in a long distance relationship. See I don’t think my self worth is that high, even after trying my best to heal it. So we went for it and went physically all the way, however I could see him starting to get distant after the first day of the trip. He kept remaining distant even though we were very much doing it every day but when we were not, he just felt far off. And not close enough?

See in the moment, because ive always felt so deprived of love, it felt amazing to have him with me. It made me feel so loved something I never really feel. 

Now it’s been two months and I’m having the hardest time. He became distant after the trip and told me he is just very busy, I kept asking him to communicate with me however I think Ive reached the limits of pushing it and I don’t know what to do. I’m ghosting him as we speak, it’s been 20 days and it is physically killing me. I am anxious almost every day, can’t function properly and always on a verge of a panic attack. I can feel myself getting into a depressive episode and i don’t know what to do, can anyone please help?

I’m sorry if the story is long.",1
"What's the point in trying to ""get better"" if I know my future is bleak?","I don't want anything out of life. I have no skills or goals or prospects. I'm a burden to my loved ones. It's only going to continue to get worse as I get older. That's been the pattern so far.

I am going to kill myself before I turn 20.,"This is not an impulsive decision. I have been struggling on and off with depression and extremely severe anxiety since I was 12. That’s almost 8 years. I tried therapy back when I had insurance but it wasn’t a good fit. I don’t have insurance anymore so therapy and medication are off the table. When I was 12, I told myself that things would be better by 16. When I was 16, I told myself that things would be better by 18. When I was 18, I told myself that things would get better by 20. Nothing ever got better. In fact, I’d say that things got comparatively worse because life got harder and I don’t have the tools to deal with it. College is impossible for me for some reason and everyone in my family thinks I’m crazy, lazy, and irresponsible because of my inability to do well. I am tired of always been behind and never understanding how other people are able to do things so well. I feel so behind maturity and career development wise that I can’t even see a world where I could ever get caught up. Maybe I am or maybe it’s whatever undiagnosed chronic health condition I have but it doesn’t matter because I can’t do this anymore. I can’t keep failing. I can’t keep living till the next happy moment only for it to fade away so quickly. I can’t keep doing things wrong and making mistakes. I haven’t made any meaningful contribution to this world and I never will be able to because the world wasn’t build for slow thinkers like me. Sure my mom will be devastated but that doesn’t out weigh the great use that will come from my organs when I die and donate them. This is the only way I can have a positive impact and make some sort of good in the world. When they ask why I did it, the answer will be easy. I was tired of not knowing what was wrong with me, and not knowing how to fix me.",1
I got denied today...,"I have been in the process of being recruited by a full-time fire department for a couple of months now.

I’m still here because I’m stubborn and I want to believe that things will get better and I don’t want my brother to be left alone, but they won’t. They only get worse and every single person I’ve ever known leaves because I’m a terrible person, and my depression is genetic so I can look to my dad to see my future and it doesn’t get better. At least he’s strong enough to stay working so he was always able to provide for his family but I will never have my own family to motivate me and the world is dying anyways so really what’s the point.",1
A new way of looking at things,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past several years, and it's had a profound impact on my outlook on life. My depression usually manifests itself in me feeling like life is completely pointless, worthless, and meaningless, and I am too. How can any of it possibly matter in the big scheme of things? 

A couple of days ago I had a seemingly ordinary experience that shifted my perspective a bit, and I found it exceptionally comforting. I was taking the trash out, nothing special about that to be sure. But there was a beautiful full moon, the air temperature was very nice in the mid-60°s F, and there was a slight breeze blowing. Everything was quiet and it was perfect. In that fleeting moment everything just felt right, and it occurred to me that in all the 13.8 billion year history of the universe, and in all the time that is yet to come, this exact moment in time was happening only where I was and only for me, and I felt the need to take a minute to stop and appreciate it. It will be mine and mine alone always. It felt special. And now, I'm finding myself frequently looking at things through that lens, and maybe things aren't quite so bad after all. Yes, there's is plenty of shit that still sucks. Yes, it still feels like humanity is hell bent on destroying ourselves. Yes, I still have a lot of negative self talk. But I feel like I've gained, or regained, an appreciation of ""the moment"" that I haven't had in a very long time. 

I know not everyone will relate to this, but I wanted to share my experience in the sincere hope that maybe just one person will find this helpful enough to improve their depression, even if only a little.",1

Not sure what to do,"I’m in a bad place right now. 

Earlier this year, I bought a house. Seems great. Life was on track. I had the normal stress of life and the things going on but it all felt ok. I’m single with 3 kids that I have joint physical custody of. 

Then a month later my car died and needed an engine replacement. It was gonna take up to 2 months to fix. I tried to appeal to my work to allow me to work from home and told them it would become a financial hardship if I had to find alternate transportation during that time. They didn’t care and I was forced to put myself in a bad budget spot just to keep my job. 

A month after that the company gets reorganized and I’m in a completely different department. I’m not a social person so after two years at this place I feel like I’m having to relearn the social structure. A couple weeks after this, I have to have a meeting with my moms nursing home about what steps will be coming soon including comfort care. 

A couple weeks after that I get put on a PIP at work. I’m being told I’ve missed deadlines that I was never aware existed for work I didn’t know was my responsibility. 

2 days later, my mom dies. 

During the next month, I go through what savings I have left trying to pay for funeral services. Im struggling to stay focused at work but I’m getting stuff done. I meet with my boss to go over work and get told I’m doing good. Then I have my PIP review with my boss and HR. I get told im being terminated and I’ve only completed 2 out of 15 items on the pip, which is somehow much less than the previous meeting. I was never getting off this pip with my job intact. My now former boss has thrown me under the bus. 

It’s been two weeks. I haven’t paid this months mortgage. I have zero job prospects. I’ve put in tons of applications and not heard a thing. My kids won’t get a Christmas from me this year. And if something doesn’t change soon, they’ll be greeted with us getting kicked out of this house by my birthday next year.

Im still unhappy, still depressed, just even more alone because my friends are all far away now. Still getting jerked around, just by PoS roommates. 

I tried buying myself candy today to feel better and chipped my teeth on the first piece.

It feels like im just drifting from one crisis to solve to another without pause. I just want it to stop. Im so tired, living just doesn't feel worth it. Even if i fix my teeth its just a holdover until something else happens. Im just done.

I keep thinking about it and I really want to do well and graduate but every time I think about the future I get stressed and the pattern repeats.

I’m stuck & there’s nothing I can really do.,"I’ve struggled with my mental health my entire life just about, and I finally feel like I got a grasp on it…now what?

I have BPD. I was a very volatile child and young adult emotionally. I was in two very toxic relationships & struggled heavily to find a sense of self worth for years, usually taking this out on others. I did try for a long time, 5 different doctors, 9 medications, so much therapy, and self admitting.

The day after my birthday last year, my ex and I broke up, which started a long journey of healing for me. I moved away from our farm animals, essentially lost my friend group, and lived alone in a camper in the woods. I experienced a pretty severe sexual assault, had a miscarriage, got into a car accident, was accused of lying about the miscarriage at work. Then a month and a half ago my brother’s remains were found—he was murdered two years ago. The news was released to the press before we had a chance to notify family.

I’m on an antidepressant. I have 3 jobs, which I love. I work out, I eat well. I have a kind boyfriend, we’ve never argued and he’s so supportive. My friends are wonderful. I journal. I read. I bake. I keep healthy boundaries. I keep a good routine. I pay for a really nice apartment. And I’m just fucking dying.

I’ve scheduled a therapy appointment but it’s a ways away. I upped my meds, then downed them, then upped them. My out of pocket costs for the doctor are insane.

Advice to support my(18f) long distance boyfriend (18m) who is feeling deoressed,"Advice to support my (18f) long distance boyfriend (18m) who is feelings depressed


My boyfriend and i have known each other for 11 months months now and dating for 3. Recently he was acting very distant and came up to me and said that he might be a little depressed. He used to be very energetic but now he barely has the energy to do stuff with me. I've talked to him about it cause I feel upset that we don't talk the same way we used to and that we've been barely spending any time together. (he doesn't respond as much. Sometimes he just doesn't respond to some of my texts. I've told him that we weren't talking much anymore and he said he just doesn't want to talk and don't know what to talk about) He realises that he's been distant and kept apologising about it. He also said that hes just been very independent and keeping to himself recently. I have also brought up the idea of asking him if he wants to just remain as friends if it's affecting him. He replied saying that he's fine with that as he doesn't want me to worry at school. I said I still love him and he said he still loves me very much too it's just that the distance was also quite hurting him on top of that.(we were planning to meet somewhere next year during the holidays) I told him that he's been very different nowadays and he said his close friends irl have said the same thing and he hates being like that but he's just so out of it but sometimes when I see him online with his online friends he acts very normal around them. (ik it's bad but I have felt jealous about it cause he casually acts normally around them but when I'm there he avoids me abit and I feel hurt) One time I joined him in game and he was acting very different when I'm around. I'm not sure if it's cause he doesn't want me to be there or if he's just losing interest. He has also said that he hates being selfish and independent and the last thing he ever wants to do is hurt me. He has also told me that he doesn't want other people to be involved with his stupid problems and that I'm not responsible for holding his weight. After the confrontation I told him that I am there for him and assured him that he is never a burden to me. I have also told him that I want us to pull through together this difficult period that he's in. He responded saying that he can't promise anything will change and I said it's okay I will wait and i can wait. Unless he wants to break it off with me I can respect that and I understand. We are still in a relationship but Im not really sure how else can i give him support. Today I asked him if we could just call and talk as I also wanted to check up on him and see how he's doing. The call went just fine and it was very normal but when he had to go I just told him again that regardless of what happens I will be always be there for him and told him how much I love him because I care for him. I asked if he has considered seeking professional help and he responded saying if it gets to that point he'll think about it. I also told him to tell me if he ever needed space I'll give him space. My heart aches to see him like this. He beats himself up alot I'm worry about him. I've told him if I could just call him sometimes just to check on how he is and he said he's fine with it. I want to understand how he's feeling and give him all the support I can give him. I miss him very much I just want him to be happy.

Tldr: bf has been distant. When asked, he said he's been a little depressed and Im not sure on how else can i support him. I love him very much and told him I'm not giving up on him.",1

Fuck it right,"
Do you know what it's like to find, your one and only your bestfriend your life partner, your soulmate. Only to be a fucking idiot loser and fuck it all up in every way possible? I do and I can only come to one solution. I've tried everything 4 times. Not just tried gave it my all. Got counselinng for both of us help we both agreed we both needed. We have almost two decades invested in each other she knows me better than anyone and I thought I knew her too.. we both grew up with our own battles and demons we both knew this for years and tried to help each other use to help each other then we got financially to the point we could get real help like we always talked about. I got help different kinds many occasions I'm not perfect but I'm better and always striving to do and be better and more positive and I can only do it for us for her for our future. I've gotten us help many times and her help but she refuses, acts like I never scheduled it or told her or she had no idea until months later when I let it blow over and she asks for help again finally comes to her husband who has been worshipping her trying to do as little stressful things as possible trying to touch her kiss her compliment the hell of of her beautiful ass do anything and everything and be a step ahead because I recognize she's declining it's a cycle and I try so fucking hard to be there for her to help her through put my own shit aside and focus on my queen.. comes to her husband and says I'm declining I'm really not in a good place I need help I say I know gorgeous I can tell and I love you it's gonna be okay and I hold her and do the things but then I go to setting about getting help she turns on me and calls me all sorts of nasty things and tells me therapy and psychologist are a waste of time blah blah blah tells me all our stressed and her problems stem from me and it goes on and on and i get frustrated and we both get irrational and she leaves kicks me out of our home and while I'm gone for a week living in my car she moves out. No big deal give her some space and time. Then I'm verbally wrecked over the phone for not communicating!? She needed space and time. She won't go file any paperwork I absolutely don't want to divorce even months later I can't look at anyone else I can't talk to anyone else I don't want anyone else my soul is crushed everyday I cry and get deeper in depression living in my car missing work.. this isn't the first time either it's the 2nd big cycle.. last time I lived in my vehicle for 8 months and recouped my life financially physically mentally and was better than ever and I did it all for her thinking I was crazy it was me etc getting so torn and confused between blaming myself and maybe it wasn't me.... any way I'm just done it's hard to even breathe anymore without her and I found her on the internet freely sharing herself and her deepest fantasies and desires and making plans etc. I don't even care about that. I love my soulmate I miss my soulmate I just want her back I just want to help her see herself for a goddess and to heal her mental pains and anguish. I hope she finds a real man and husband the kind she really deserves someone not such a angry pos like me. 
I don't want to hurt anyone I really don't I have a lot of love left but my soul and my heart physically I can't take it and I don't vwen understand if it's my fault or not where I went so wrong but I know people like me can't continue to exist so fuck it I'm doing it",1
I’m beyond my threshold to continue,"5 years ago I hit my lowest point. My mental health reached a low I didn’t know existed until then. I was put in therapy, on medication, the whole nine. 

Since then I’ve tried to find normalcy. I was told by people who were trying to help “Hold on, it gets better”. Now that it’s been years, what i expected is true. It’s a cliche. Shit does not get better. It’s told to you, in order to buy more time for fuck knows what.

Oddly though i hate the thought of suicide. I cannot bring myself to it. What I seek is rest. I don’t want to live but I don’t want to die. So what am I looking for? I wish I knew. Maybe un-unhappiness. I’m not asking to be ecstatic all the time but if I could have periods of the day we’re I’m not constantly thinking about the sleep of death. That would be great.

I’m in college, but I lost my drive. Economy is fucked so I don’t know what to do. How do people live through life. Do they not see what I see? Or feel what I feel? Am I abnormal for wanting to get the fuck out of here?

Well that’s me.

Sometimes fighting can look like doing nothing, allowing the blah feeling to just be there without falling into it, not caring about work but still be somewhat/barely present, scrolling on your phone to stay engaged but not caring about anything you look at.

That’s where my head is. Holding on by a thread - not wanting to get into a sunken place that would be very hard to dig out of.

I also think it’s because I’m feeling a lot of pressure right now. Not sure why but I just do - pressure to be perfect or eventually have my life make sense bc right now my life feels like it’s in a state of subtle chaos ",1
Keep sinking back into this dark pit,"In 2017, I was filled with hope and made all the wrong choices. I enrolled in university for a masters degree, not knowing shit about what the real world was like, what career options I would be facing. I went abroad and did my masters from one of the top universities, barely graduating. I ended up returning to my home country and its been two years since. Never got a job in my field because I didn't have the right  skills. I write for a living and make decent money but I have no friends, all of them settled in their lives. I stay home all day. I've gained weight, now at 150kgs.

I want to work out but even walking hurts my back. I spiral back into a depressive eating binge. I barely look after myself. Just sit in front of a computer and write all day. I don't watch tv anymore because i have to drag myself to finish my work. Just get up, eat and work. My friends have families, travel while I just looking from the outside. I blame myself for it all. 

Even now, I can make changes. I just have no motivation. It's like I've convinced myself that no matter what I do, nothing will change.

I'm trying to do certifications. I'm trying to write out daily goals. I got myself an eliptical so that its easy for my knees. But I never do anything.

I had goals in life in 2017. I would get a job in my field. I would lose weight. I would have my own apartment. I would travel, find a partner. Maybe have kids. But none of that happened. On days I feel bitter. On days, I blame others. Most of the time I blame myself.

Any advice?,"(I can’t edit the title but there is a little bit of rant in this) 
I’m a senior in high school I have no reason to be depressed, I was diagnosed in 5th grade for depression took meds for around a year made me feel worse and even made me turn to self harm like a month in but it was such a financial burden on my family I felt I had to stay on it. I got diagnosed after yelling at my mom I wanted to kms in a heated argument but I didn’t mean it (I hate suicide even though I see why you would do it) I felt this dull feeling that I didn’t realize I would feel forever and was confused and at the time jokes and threats about Kys or kms was popular so I just blurted it out, so it’s not like I wasn’t depressed but I felt as if the meds advanced my connection of the two leading to it being worse. I have no idea because I haven’t talked to a professional in the past 7-8 years but I think it’s linked to my DNA, both my parents have depression and their parents to and the parents before them. My life is so fucking bland it feels like as if someone took a grey paintbrush and spattered it into my brain and eyes leading to a filter on every single fucking emotion, moment or general feelings if I have an emotion like happiness it feels fleeting but anger is easier to reach but when I get angry it than feels hopeless so I drop it, I’ve been able to cope with these feelings by becoming my own therapist of sorts, using deceptive tactics in a vain hope of either tricking my brain or making it feel better or just sitting there brooding for what seems forever as I race through my mind pulling the string of why who what when where. I think I am good at hiding my emotions as people rarely have questions or statements regarding them, until recently multiple times I’ve been pulled aside by friends asking if I was good or a joke on my reaction to emotional feelings for example I was joking with my friends but that particular day I felt nothing if that makes sense like a jug with a tiny whole on the bottom, the happiness would pour in the bottom and sides getting saturated but always draining and just as fast as it was poured in it drained and one of my friends noticed and made a joke about it and it shook me to the core as if my facade has been seen through exposing my inner feelings, and I did not like it. I don’t like talking about my emotions to others including therapists that might be because my first therapist did not really care to help me but prescribe meds right away to cycle me it felt like because after the prescription the therapist became more passive instead of trying to actively unconfuse me ig and because I’m a male, that might sound like a cop out but society at least the area im in will make you feel not needed if you are a guy with problems he can’t push through by themself and whenever someone regardless of gender says it’s okay you can talk it feels fake like if I do they will use it against me there are only a few people I actually talk about this to, however I really enjoy helping others through whatever it may be it makes me feel whole like that sad part is muffled out. The gray filter forced upon my eyes is leading me to feel insane as if I am disconnected to myself but I still feel emotions, I don’t despise happy people at all but I feel ashamed when I see someone who is just preset happy, what the fuck did I do to deserve these fucking feelings that are making me want to end it all before even experience life to its fullest? It feels unfair due to whatever that I may not experience true happiness, who the fuck says that my feelings of happy is what happy is? I’ve seen some people and talked to people who are happy every day and is just clueless to why I’m sad and it leaves me even more confused. The last two years I have seen my mental health spiral from what feels like a third person perspective I’ve had one mental breakdown in my 17 years of life up until 2 years ago where I have had over 10, in one month i had 4 I would find myself just breakdown to the point I feel as if I need to curl up and cry for hours for no fucking reason it feels like. I can’t take compliments well, not externally I won’t flip out or nothing but on the inside an internal dialogue will open it up that ends jn “your right you don’t deserve that” like if someone calls me smart it makes me feel like the stupidest fuck in the world like you are only telling me that out of pity same with compliments about look and personality it makes me feel fake. But I know that is not their intentions so I never hold it against anyone. There are high expectations placed on me that I bet I can reach but the drive is not there, my parents want me to reach college or join the military and reach college but idek if my past medical record disqualifies me from the military and that horrifies me that is the path I want to take, I’ve wanted to join the military since a young age. So I might have to just go to college after high school not right after but it’s expected I do it soon and that extra stress has been breaking me mentally to the point I don’t feel anything but stress it feels like. High school has been really easy to me up to this point that I have not prepared for a rigorous course like college and it stresses me out knowing I’m in a position that a lot of college drop outs find themselves in but if I do go into college I could not face the shame ig of failing it.",1

Yknow? There's just something so casual about how people make friends, enjoy their jobs, or lightheartedly complain about said job and then say things like ""Oh, I'm gonna do *something* to destress"". It's just such a wild concept to me?

I've done things that are suppose to be relaxing, obviously. Yknow, read a book, go for a walk, have a warm bath, but none of it actually seems to have any affect whatsoever?

Like, does everyone else get a little stressed, take some time to relax and decompress, and then just... Bounce back?

I don't think I've ever fully experienced truly feeling refreshed after, well, anything.",1
Why am I paralysed,"I'm feeling very tired all of the time. I'm feeling exhausted, run down and beaten.. but there's still the next day. The next day where you might be too tired to get up or just have enough energy to try then get defeated again by some minor or major inconvenience. 

I'm so depressed recently, it's probably one of the times where Ive really actually thought this is it for me, I can't keep fighting because I'm so exhausted with no rewards. I'm beaten, I'm kicked, I'm down. I've been suicidal before and I've genuinely, really, actually wanted to do it but there's been hope residing within my heart still.

But now, I don't know. I'm not saying I'm gonna do anything, I'm just saying that this point in my life is SO hard right now that I don't know if I have it in my heart or soul to fight anymore. I promise you I feel so done.

I keep trying to tell everyone how exhausted I am but I feel like no one feels how serious I am. I know everyone got their own story going on, it's hard to focus on someone else when you're living the main character in your life, I get it. 

I used to think it would hurt my son; now I think he would literally not remember a single detail about me eventually, he wouldn't. He's 4. I'm insignificant to anyone. 

The guys wanna go, they wanna make things work, but they got conditions and reasons for that which you ain't gonna like but that's fact. 

What purpose do I serve? I'm too tired to do shit, I'm too depressed to get motivated. Everyone will call me selfish for taking my life even though, if I stick around, everyone will say I'm selfish for not contributing to society as much as they do. I can't win, I don't WANT to be here, I never asked for it, I'm not happy, I'm smothered and I'm suffocating.",1
Alone,Alone want to talk... kinda lonely 😞,1
i'm a miserable teen,"I'm so miserable, and I have been since I can't even remember. My whole life has been severely depressing, and I've constantly been angry, miserable, unmotivated, and tired. I'm so tired I can barely function, I'm so behind in school, and I'm failing severely in math, and my report card is very disappointing since I've never really been good at school or anything in my entire life. My father is really unwell right now physically, and I'm really scared he'll end up in the hospital again. Last time, he nearly went into septic shock and passed, which is horrifying, and he's the only one in my life who I really care about aside from my dog and maybe a few friends.  
I get bullied at school and pushed around. Some dude spreads rumours and shit about me, and I don't do anything because I don't want to cause stuff, and I just hope it washes away. All my attempts fail, and I'm always too scared most of the time because I fear being hurt. Everyone thinks I'm a gay (which i am, but closeted due to a very homophobic school), ugly loser who's pathetic and insanely dumb, and I hate it. I want to die so badly, but recently I've felt so tired and restless that I can't even die.",1
So confused help,"I know i get paranoid quickly and shift the blame to myself...but this is too much for me to handle
Recently i stumbled on a video of Andrew tates, he calls depressed people who want a therapist or need to talk as useless using the fact that children in warzones who lost their families still able to wake up and face life and overwork. I gathered many mental illnesses, starting from severe depression, borderline and many more, including suicide attempts. I can't help but think that he's right and i'm just a weak useless piece of shit, i ruined my life by being weak and let the life beat me up without me being able to fight back??? I was useless to both myself and to the healthcare system who has to bear the insane costs of my complex treatment or those i force to waste their time to treat a bad case like me?? I failed myself and whatever i achieved is rn meaninless that i know i failed my life",1
Untitled i,"I have hurt my best friend, the only person I could ever truly trust. I will never forgive myself for this. I have realized today why she ran away from me. I have realized today that you can abuse someone with neglect. I was so shocked when she left, I didn't think we were that bad but I'm proud of her. I thought at first she was running away from her problems and that she was weak for that. Now I see that she was running away from me, someone she loved, and how hard that is. She is strong through everything she has been through and she keeps on going. She will grow to be so strong, and I will take my place in in her path to greatness with humility and honor no matter how how hard and sad it will be. 

It's so hard to be alone right now but I have no one I want to talk to. The only person I trusted needs to be away from me. Having so much to say and no one to say it to is true loneliness. I have lost my light, and I know I have to continue living and start my walk in the darkness but it's hard when  you're to shattered to take a step.",1
Don't know what to do anymore,"Hello, i type this because i really need to take things off my chest, i do not know what to do anymore, i have a hard time being productive, i cant really sleep but that maybe is because i do mostly nothing productive all day.

I just saw a tiktok post about bipolar disorder and i don't know why i have been triggered, i been to therapy and psychiatrist and they both told me i do not have bipolar disorder so i guess right now is just my anxiety playing tricks on me.

Its currently 9:33pm (21:33), i tried to fall asleep for the past hour but it is not really working and its sending me in to an overthinking spiral, i know its because i fell asleep late last night and woke up even more late. 

I feel like like im never going to recover and that im going to fall back to where i was back to square one... so what is really the point in trying anymore... ",1
I am collapsing,"I can't do it anymore, i feel like my whole life just consists of problems. I have so much i want to improve but i don't know where to start. Everything is impacting each other and it's getting worse and worse. It took me years (like, years) to seek professional help. They are now assessing me for autism and/or dysthymia and/or other stuff and i should have the outcome next week. I've been on waiting lists for a few months and somehow dealing with your head is so much worse when you're waiting then when you just accept the misery and deal with it yourself. I can't do this much longer, i am absolutely desperate, i know i've been needing antidepressants for a very long time. I'm doing worse in school, my teachers don't understand that i have serious issues but also i can't tell them anything specific since i haven't been diagnosed yet. I don't know the last time i was truly happy, every day i'm just dragging myself from task to task trying to at least feel a little productive. Not even my hobbies interest me anymore. I hate my life and i hate myself i want to jump off a cliff",1
"Help, i feel like there's no other option anymore","Hello! i've never truly voiced anything but to certain friends. 
i am trying the best i can but it feels like it's all pointless
i have a cat no family at all, maybe 2 friends when we remember we're friends and a boyfriend, i work a shitty bartending job (friday-sat sometimes sundays if available) trying to afford my stuff but it's just not enough
i'm also in school trying to do hair for a living. just as reference.
i want to hang on so badly but everything feels as it's getting worse. the more shifts i pickup somehow i make less money then i did the previous week only working 2 shifts instead of three. i love my boyfriend very much and he works like 70hrs just to compensate for my short comings and the fact we just got a place together and we don't move in till January so in about a month few weeks til then from this post.
i dont do laundry anymore and wait until im completely out of absolutely everything (and sometimes not) 
my cars a total wreck and mess, barely brush my teeth i forget to shower and do skincare or care about myself either because waking up everyday is a challenge in itself and i want to go to the gym because i absolutely hate how i feel and loook rn:
i sit here trying not to feel sorry for myself put in a fake smile everyday never show anyone my true self
i brush my teeth maybe once a day in the mornings (been doing kinda ok lately flossing mouthwash sometimes 2x a day)
at my school i have 4 girls i happen to really like and they really like me too! refreshing bc of how i feel about myself behind closed doors.
but i keep running into financial problems because i don't make enough to afford my rent with my roommates rn, car, insurance, gas, overrrr balance on my credit card all the electric bills and those kinds of bills and my school payment (i can't drop out and work until i am in better money bc i still have to pay for it even if i quit, yay financial aid!!) . i don't have family to just ask if im lacking financially. my moms a drunk in and out of jail and rehab and no one else in my family talks to me bc i stuck my neck out for her for years and they just assumed i would be just like her. i've been in foster care i've been homeless i moved out when i was 11 bouncing on friends couches beds and ultimately the system. no one taught me how to do things. i dropped out of high school (embarrassing to me) but i got my GED. i don't want to be this super negative around the very few people i have close to me but i am quite literally one more thing away from just having a whole mental shutdown. i am not motivated to do anything but i don't want everyone to know how deep and dark of a time it is, yet im the happiest ive ever been. im not homeless not in foster care im surrounded by great people i got my ged i put myself in school. i've been talking with my boyfriend about marriage and kids because we truly are madly and deeply about one another and he's a really good guy. i feel guilty for having him work as much as he does to pick up the slack of what i cannot do. i tried applying everywhere but no one reaches back, i call to check and they're not hiring anymore or whatver the reason they have is, im so reliable and hardworking and it sucks.
i simply don't think i can hang on much longer because i genuinely think all the odds are just not in my favor, like i have bad luck and i've never had a pretty hand but this one feels like one of the worst hands ive gotten in awhile
i really need help. this is truly my cry for help i feel as if im all out of options",1
Knowing others have worse than me doesn't help,"Hi everyone. I was never diagnosed with depression, however I feel that's what I'm struggling with right now since I have most of the symptoms. I'm 23F still living at with at my family house. I don't even feel worthy of taking your time for reading this shit I'm about to write.. Well I've never really shared these things with anyone mainly because I don't have any person to talk to. 

I'm not good at keeping my friendships last and always end up being and feeling alone. 

Most of the time I stay in my room, binge watching IG reels and procrastinating. I'm a college student but my classes are this semester only 1 day a week since I'm finishing my degree. I'm trying to look for a job however I don't feel like it'll fix anything I'll just be depressed with a job.. but getting out of my house potentially could benefit me and feel less shame of wasting my time. I've gained some wight and stopped feeling attractive at all.

I don't have any hobbies when I take up something I always end up leaving it. I try to meditate but fail in being consistent.

I don't believe that it'll ever get better even though I'm relatively young. I've been living on this mode on and off for the past 10 years. I had big dreams when I was younger but now I don't seem to have any. Sometimes it gets better when I find people I can connect with but they eventually leave for one or other reason. I don't talk with anyone on a daily basis beside my mom and sometimes the rest of the family. But I feel judged by the majority of them. I used to be a very good student back at high and secondary school but now I simply can't focus on anything bigger in my life and feel ashamed of that. 

I've never had a boyfriend I've never pursued any relationship because it was never my focus in life. I don't even think i'll ever be in a romantic relationship.

Thank you for reading through my rants. As I said I'm sharing these thoughts with anybody for the first time but even sharing them with internet strangers makes me less heavy on my mind. I know others have much worse than me... Sorry for any writing mistakes I'm not a native speaker :).",1
Over stimulated,There's too much going on. I'm having trouble just living. I crave death this is way too much my brain isn't processing anything I want to go to sleep,1
So I'm kinda over it.,"So about 18 months ago my mother passed. This year near her anniversary I shut down gave up for about 2 weeks. During the first year of her passing I went to work most of the time. Dr got me on some different anti depression meds anti anxiety etc. Went from 150mg Welbutrin and 80 MG prozac and 2 or 3 of abiliify to a different style of welbutrin and some other crap. I feel the same and im.maxed out. During the last year I have a new gm my previous gms both actually did things and took part in maintaining a nicer facility. I do the maintenance of equipment etc. My previous gms would do pool testing janitorial deal with members who were disgruntled etc. 

New gm does nothing works out 3 hours a day when he's supposed to be on the clock he's salary and I've reached out because there's nothing in the policies he allowed to do whatever. Anyways he hired a bunch of new part time employees ran out the good ones by rewarding them with more and more work. 

He had one he suspected of them fraud had documented times via cameras and punches etc. He rewarded him with the hours he wanted and days he wanted. 

The people who need the job necause of schooling etc are biting their toungues and leaving when they can some have 6 months to a year left and are out. 

During the last year I went from.a good employee to watching shit employees get rewarded. I have a coworker who buys browses and orders items to the work location who despite my being told the evals nobody should score 3s as it was you were perfect and nobody's perfect blah blah wel I put down 2s guess who go threes... 

How do I know this I have the key to every damn door in the building and when my office was made into massage chair rooms I would use the gm desk and computer and what's laying on the desk in open view.
All the bs about people getting 3s me getting 2 and the hour fraud. 

I had hopes at one point of leaving the town I reside in for better living less issues and less of California's crap since in the last year I've had to support my younger adult siblings when they wre both unemployed one laid off and one fired for of all things time theft at Walmart. His only job and no diploma and he can't find a job now. 

I feel like I'm just waiting to die. 

Why waiting because I won't leave that thought in my kids head. But damn I. Kinda just over it. My kid when he turns 18 plans to move 30 minutes to an hour away with his half sister. If they want to cool
 But after that which is in less than 4 years I have no responsibility
 

I let my creditt go to shit to take care of my siblings and kid because of the financial situation. And now I'm like really this is what I get to look forward to I'm 41. I've been told I have a dark outlook om things. It wasn't always this way I had hopes dreams and goals . It just all feels dead. I've been told im.not bipolar my mother was. and likely have several depressive disorder.per a psychologist. 

I cooked Thanksgiving this year and literally it felt so dead despite having my siblings and child there. Like literally like nothing really mattered. I ate some and wrent to bed. It was the only thing I ate prior to bed. I've called in the last 3 work days. 

Sorry to pile on. I wasn't sure where else to put this and maybe it's me asking for help. I don't know

I'm looking at jobs but I don't know if that's the awnser when it all kinda feels like I'm just waiting my turn. 

Like even the last Woman I had an intrest in. Like she mentioned on our last talk we went from nightly for hours before I kinda backed away and said this isn't going anywhere then my mom passed and she reached out that morning. Since then we will talk occasionally for a few hours here and there and then not talk and when we do she said I know you are interested in dating me. And 2 years ago I left the company I was at working with her inorder to obtain more money and maybe her. But honestly now I'm like yeah we can talk for hours and she's pretty and my type but I'm definitely less flirty and i dont even try and spend time with her anymore but its.not fair to her to deal with my shit the way I am currently even if I did want to date her or be in a relationship. 

Because I feel like I don't know what I need or want and feel like I'm just waiting on the hands to strike that hour on the clock whenever and be done with it. 

Sorry if this makes you uncomfortable or creates depression in you. Like I said just kinda over it.sorry for the partial narrative and starter to a book",1
Replaying my life thru the lens of Depression,"Instead of beating myself up, I looked for the beginning.

My main symptoms of Depression:  negative self-talk, 'the world is against me', getting lost in my own head, etc

Looking back, I can remember when I started thinking like that.  When Depression started creeping in.  Was it there on my first day of school?  Yes.  Was it there when I had my first girlfriend?  Yes.  Was it there during my first memory?  No.  

I have a terrible memory, so I have to do it with major, memorable moments.  

I'm hoping this might help someone else.  Good luck. 🤗",1
Don’t know what’s wrong with me…but I know I’m not feeling like myself,"I know I have anxiety and I have a therapist. Out of nowhere, I’ve been hit with this rush of sadness and hopelessness. I just have no desire to go to work, no desire to study for a big exam coming up or to even care for my career. (This is very unlike what people would think of me bc I’m normally a ‘high achiever’)

The idea of work makes me feel more & more meaningless because I’m just doing the same thing week after week after week and I don’t really like what I do. I’m starting to despise sales and I’m in a sales job.

I shouldn't have been born but I was brought to this world. It was terrible experiences. I wish I realized that my parents were Immature and narcisstic and abusive in the first place. I should have stood up for myself. Do better but I didn't. 

I always hated that my mother seeing me as golden ticket for her comfortable life eventhough she didn't support me in anything. Always complained me her life and sometimes she blamed me a bit for everything. 

I regret I gave away my college saving to my mother. I hate myself for it.

I have no hope. I think it's too late for me. But I want to live. I want to taste what is like to have normal life like the others instead of consistent poverty and hopelessness",1
Depression,"I don’t like that people keep saying it’s an illness as a blanket statement for everyone. Depression is a consequence of my experiences and life. It’s like someone destroying your life then claiming it’s an “illness” if you refuse to get over it. I don’t have to get over it. I don’t have to do anything I don’t want to. I have several dealbreakers and if those things happen I have no interest in living life anymore. I want certain things by a certain time and if I don’t get them then life isn’t worth living anymore. If other people see life differently and would prefer to live no matter what, open to anything happening at anytime, then that is their choice.

depression and motherhood,"i’m usually all about the anxiety, but the last couple months, i’ve fallen into a very deep depression. i’m a SAHM to a wonderful 3yo but the sleep issues and loneliness are killing me. other than now, the only time i’ve ever felt nearly suicidal was when i was first pregnant and lost my mind.

the days are endless and bedtime is a nightmare. i can’t sit on the couch all day but can’t find enough to fill up the days (we do a TON of stuff). i even joined a gym to help my mental health.

my marriage is a joke and my husband doesn’t help much. i’m solo parenting for the most part. he complained my mom was here too much so now she’s not and i’m left without my major support system.

i’m sad and lonely and wish i could run away. i’m jealous of my single and child-free friends. i sleep 10 hours a day and could easily sleep more, but then i wake up and have insomnia.

is my life pointless?,"So I have depression since I’m something like 11. I’m 16 now. I tried therapy and anti depressants, I talked to my friends about it and tried everything to enjoy life again. Nothing worked. I cut myself since I’m 11, my both thighs are covered in scars and I can’t stay clean for a while. The anti depressants made my feel unbelievably tired and even more depressed, I couldn’t cry or feel so much emotion, but sometimes I felt everything at once and broke down. I don’t know if it’s even worth to keep on living at this point. I don’t like my life and I don’t like my emotions. It’s draining. I feel so helpless, sometimes I think my friends don’t understand how awful life feels for me, which makes me even more sad. I’m alone with this. Everyone around me are living their life while I’m stuck in depression and questioning life every night. Would you guys say, my life is pointless? Please be honest with me. I‘m tired of life, please get me out of this.",1
"Was I sexually assaulted?, got very bad trauma after an event","It happened a year ago we were both in a new relationship. A little backstory he was barely my ex we were together for a month, and it ended on bad notes, before that we were very good friends. We decided to forgive each other and become good again. I don’t know why I forgave him or wanted to become friends again, I was very stupid. However we went to the same outside concert. I went with my friend and he with his friend. He asked me to meet up. I said no but he insisted so I thought “ok just for a little bit”, he was very pushy. I got very drunk, half a vodka bottle type drunk. At first it was just very nice and fun until he said “can we go over there, I have to talk to you”. There he asked me over and over again to become his girlfriend again and pushed me to kiss him, after saying no 6 times he sighed and I felt I had to. After that I barely remember. I remember him telling me to go with him to the place he was staying at, he told me there were other people staying there but when we got there no one was there. I sat down on his bed where he kind of told me to get out of my clothes. I didn’t take all of them off I think. But he was just on his boxers. I felt very uncomfortable. He asked me to have sex and I said “no” and “it’s disrespectful” after that I can’t remember anything except me being coerced to say yes. I called my friend and he also asked her if he can have sex with me and just put my hand on his thing. I was very nice to him afterwards and tried to kind of convince myself I wanted it. Few days later I told my other friend about it and she told me I was assaulted and I spoke to his mom about it. I tried telling his gf, but I felt like she didn’t believe me and blocked me. Am I wrong? I am very traumatised after this and I feel dirty EVERY day.",1
Lost in life(super long),"I’ve been diagnosed with persistent clinical depression. I have had 6 therapists over the past 17 years, used a whole lot of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, digital detoxes, and whatever people have recommended. It doesn’t work. I was first diagnosed with clinical depression in 6th grade, but resisted treatment of any sort. Wouldn’t say a word in protest at my first and second therapist. Both of the therapists said I was clearly depressed, which I definitely was, and that higher help from a psychiatrist might be a good idea. I resisted the thought and resented it, thinking I was wronged by my parents for even insinuating I require aid from someone else. I was on Ritalin with a high dosage for a year and I don’t know if it fucked my brain chemistry up to a point where nothing is actually enjoyable to me anymore. It might be depression that has been with me since 4th grade. 

They never brought me to another therapist again.

Fast forward, depression gets worse through high school, except for when I start to come out of it a little in my senior/junior year. It went to mild at best.  The previous years were incredibly difficult for me mentally. Bullying, divorce, dealing with keeping my brother happy, working. I was nothing close to a model student as I would walk into class, sleep, read, or play on my phone. Senior year however, my  grades drastically improved by not sleeping through classes on a constant basis. One of my teachers even approached me and said I’m doing significantly better than she thought I would do, and I got offended saying “cause I’m actually putting a modicum of effort in”, which makes me cringe at night thinking about it. I couldn’t take the compliment because I didn’t want it and still want no compliments, and I don’t know why. Made honor roll and other accolades no one thought I would ever get. Got athletic scholarship offers because of the massive improvement in my grades. Did well on my sat despite never actually trying to improve on them because I had no motivation to do so besides “keep your parents off your back” mentality. Depression was still there and eating away at me the whole time. I could resist it a bit, but that soon puttered out too. 

Going to freshman year of college, I felt like I climbed out of it, a fresh start, new friends, a couple of girls who I thought I liked. Nah, brain went back to hibernation mode with in 4 days. Stopped caring again, and grades declined again. Missed half of my classes that semester and still passed, but with a 1.9gpa. Not proud but it’s better than a 0.0. Second semester, I found myself drowning even more. I was still a top contender for my varsity squad and was even in the top 3 for performance. Won a couple of major competitions that saw competitors from around the world fly in. I still remember thinking, I don’t want to be here. Let’s hurry up and go home. Standing on the podium didn’t give me a sense of accomplishment or validation or achievement. It felt empty as everything else has.

Starting to understand why people SH,"TW: mentions of self harm

I’ve reached the point of depression where I’m starting to understand why people self harm. I want so badly to feel something. Anything.

I’m not one to give in to those impulses, thankfully, so dw I’m not going to do anything. I’m just starting to understand those who do, I guess.

I basically gave up and let my whole life fall apart after that. I quit my job because I was having meltdowns and panic attacks multiple times a day. The job was dangerous so I didn't want to put anyone at risk due to my mental state. I pretty much just went home and started doing drugs all day everyday to cope.

I have no desire to go back to work or do anything because there's nothing to work towards. I feel like my life is worthless and there's no point to anything. All I want to do is lay in bed and get high. Nothing even interests me anymore. I hate myself so much. Whenever my family tries to motivate me everything they say just sounds like a bunch of bullshit. All that talk about self love and doing something with my life. For what? What the fuck is even the point to anything? Everytime I try or anytime I start to feel happy I just fall on my face. I'm tired if trying. And as for my ex she already is dating someone new. The last time I talked to her a month ago she told me that I mean nothing to her and she wouldn't care if I was dead. Meanwhile I can't even find one person to hookup with just to ease the pain a little. She was the only person I had in my life. The only thing that motivated me to keep going. Now she's gone and I have nothing. I just feel like my life is worth nothing and it wouldn't even matter if I wasn't here. There's a reason no one wants me in their life. I'm not good enough and I never will be.",1
ADHD and depression,"Everything is becoming so intense and I feel so alone. Turning 18 soon and I feel so lost and deprived of support and validation. I feel I lack so much experience with friends, romantically and just in general. Does purposefullness and responsibility just come with experience I don’t know how to deal with anything",1
I get sad when I see pictures of people I know partying and having a good time.,"As a 20 year old, I cannot relate to that at all. I never made friends in Uni (in my 3rd year) and I know I never will at all. It's hopeless. Seeing them having a good time makes me realise I cannot relate to them, and never will. This is the reality of the world I live in. 

It's times like this when suicide seems SO appealing. Fuck this shit man. I'm never gonna be happy",1
It feels like the inevitable is creeping closer.,"It’s been at least ten years now, I’ve gradually fucked up my life in almost all facets. I’ve lost most that are close to me in various ways, some due to my choices and actions over the course of months/years, others in most ways you can probably already think of yourself. Seeking help has only resulted in drug addictions that spiralled into others. I’ve tried and I assume purposely failed somehow due to the facts I have seen the damage left behind due to the aftermath. That’s not something I’d ever want to put my mother and 1 of my sisters through. I think the other two would be able to cope. But each and every day, no matter how hard I try to do everything suggested to me, I try my absolute hardest, I feel like it’s all just day by day making it’s way closer to the point where the pros outweigh the cons.",1
Someone help me please,"Im at a point where I don't know what to do... I don't want to end it but that seems like the only option .

I'm sorry to everyone for being weak! can't take it anymore",1
i kinda want someone to be mean to me,I wish someone would throw a couple punches or slam my head into a wall or something. i thought i’d be better after i moved out but it’s been many years and i still miss the chaos. it’s mainly when i get sad i just want someone to beat me up or something. so i’ll actually have a reason to be sad,1
Am I Depressed?,"I’m recently unemployed, living at home with my dad and brother. My dad works and my brother is still at school. My mum died a few years ago but I try to ignore that as best as I can.

I want to find something to do, like a hobby or something but I have absolutely no motivation to do so. I physically can’t sleep until 6am every night and am waking up just before midday, with no reason to be awake. The shorter days are a headfuck and I have nobody to go and see and I feel too tired to try and meet people or volunteer somewhere. I try and eat some cereal when I wake up but I can hardly finish it because I always feel nauseous, and even when I get peckish in the afternoons I can’t be bothered to eat anything or even snack. I have a job interview next week but I don’t want the job because I feel burnt out, but I need money for rent/ bills. I literally lay in my bed every single day until I go downstairs for dinner, and then I just come back up and do nothing again. I’ve thought of joining a gym or something, but where I can’t eat properly, I just get worn out of feel faint quickly, and again, I just feel like I can’t be bothered to get up. I’m not interested in gaming or anything that required my attention because I feel too tired. 

I want to get up and do something, but it’s just a vicious cycle because I just feel tired and want to go and lay down again. I don’t talk to anybody for majority of the day, and even when I talk to my family in the evenings I just want to go back to bed because I feel too tired and like shit again. I feel like shit and like my life is completely pointless.

Am I depressed? Like seriously, because wtf else could this be?",1
havent cared for myself for a whole week,"life has gotten so low to the point where im imagining suicide atleast 5 times a day. all i think about is how my past friends have new friends and good grades, and they celebrate christmas with them at their cool school, while i have to work for 7 weeks at some random company because my shit school and shit school-course demands so. all i hear everyday is my dad complaining about me laying in bed with my phone all day. i only meet my friends on weekends, or rather every other weekend. while they manage to meet their new friends literally every single day. ive become a loser, a worthless walking stick with barely any meat on my body because i eat less and less every week. i manage to shower mostly every three days, but it’s getting less frequent. i havent managed to change my bed clothes for two months almost. i dont brush my teeth as carefully as i used to. 

it’s getting colder and colder out. i had to work in -10° celsius for 4 hours and then walk 3 kilometers to town, to then get on a buss for it to drive 5 kilometers for me to have to walk another kilometer to my house, all while my friends get to sit in their classrooms with their girlfriends and boyfriends and christmas decorations. 

i cant do this anymore. im probably going to end it soon enough. just trying to figure out what would hurt the least. sucks that guns are not allowed at all in this cold boring country.",1
Numbness,"I am just curious to know if there are any people at all feeling like me.
I have gone emotionally numb a couple of years ago and i am completely aware of the fact, i do want to change it but i can't. It is all connected to my very dark childhood which still hasn't ended yet.i am not depressed and i am not suicidal either but i guess i don't really want to live at all. I am just there, i don't feel happiness nor sadness,a couple of days ago a very tragic event happened and while everyone was screaming their lungs out i was just standing out there pretending this was just a regular day. Everytime i go out and see my peers in college i have to act like i am an actual human just to not get called a weirdo and a creep,i am forced to laugh at their stupid jokes and i have to pretend that i enjoy them gossiping about others just to fit in. Now i must adress that i don't hate any of them, i wish them all the best but i really don't like being around anyone including my family members. Whatever happens i just really don't care anymore but i can't really say that i went completely numb either as i constantly participate in charity events and i feel good about helping those in need,that is one of the only times i feel an emotion at all and also when i see an animal that needs help. I am really struggling to express the exact feeling but to sum it up in the easiest way i have become a literal robot. I don't enjoy anything at all and just living overall has become a chore for me,i don't have any hobbies and i don't want to find them either,i just don't want to do anything at all..i am just completely lost at this point and i really don't know what am i doing. I have a lot and i mean a lot more to say but i am just struggling to express as there are so many things..i just want to know if anyone had the same problem and how did you overcome it?
Thanks in advance and i apologize for my bad english.",1
I just want to be left alone,"I’m drained, I’m not over anything, I have to put on a happy face and yet I feel sick to my stomach.

My Best Friend Is Taking a Break From Me Because of My Depression,"I (29f) noticed that my best friend (29f) was acting distant from me for a while. I finally told her in early September that we needed to talk, and she told me she's been distancing herself on purpose. She said that while I don't treat her as a therapist, our conversations about how I feel when I'm depressed are too much to process, and she needs to take a break from our friendship. Of course, I respect her decision and appreciate her sending boundaries. 

I've been avoiding talking to her because we agreed it was better for her to reach out. She wished me a happy birthday in late September, which makes me feel like she still cares about me and our friendship. The only other contact we've had was when she accidentally charged almost $200 on my credit card. It was a total accident because my card is still on her Amazon account (I used to use it and don't anymore), and she picked my card by mistake. I let her know, and she Venmoed me back. When I told her about the charge, she said she planned to reach out to me soon to get dinner. This was early November, and I have been waiting to hear from her since. 

I'm heartbroken. We've been best friends for 10 years. Best friends like this don't come around very often. I feel awful that I hurt her. She only told me that she was purposefully distancing herself because I confronted her about needing to talk, and she said she let it go on longer than it should. I feel so terrible that I kept hurting her with my depression because I wasn't aware of how much it was hurting her. 

I don’t know what to do. I miss her so much. But at the same time, I know our friendship will never be the same. I asked her months ago if she was mad at me because things felt off between us. She said everything was fine, but I now know that she lied. Because of this, I'll have a hard time trusting her because she went so long without telling me this. 

Does anyone have a similar experience or feedback on what to do? I'm so lost. And now, I'm worried about opening up to any of my other friends about how I'm feeling. I'm afraid to hurt someone again. ",1
why does everyone treat each other so fucking awful,"i just don’t understand. how can someone lie to you make u feel important understood and like they actually care about you make you trust them enough to open up, and when you finally do open up they use your biggest insecurities and vulnerabilities against you. people are fucking sick. people are so cruel. I am honestly not even surprised. It’s fucking terrifying how there are such terrible calculated people out there who just want to hurt you bc they are so fucked up themself. I do nothing but try to be nice to people and treat them with respect and i’ll i do is get shit on every fucking time. I feel sick.  I am in disbelief that people can do stuff like that so easily. what the actual fuck.",1
i kinda want people to be mean to me,"i currently have the sweetest art teacher, and she'll let me sit in her room and cry/vent when she has a free period. she's really understanding, and sometimes she's the only thing that keeps me going to school. the thing is though, i kinda wish she was mean to me

im missing a few art assignments, ill occasionally skip in her art class which she could get into trouble for, and im basically taking up the only time she has to herself to cry (everyone loves her, so during every other time of day besides her free period, she has a horde of kids talking to her). i genuinely don't get why she keeps being nice to me. i really don't deserve it 

i almost wish she'd kick me out, because that would make sense to me, cause im literally just ruining her only free time and probably making her more stressed. i don't get why she's still nice to me

any advice or anything?",1
Lost.,"Honestly.. I don’t know if anyone will read this.. but here I go. I’ve had to be numb since I was young from my cousins mistreating me in bad ways to to my teenage years spent people abusing my kindness in numb…My year started off bad.. I had to put my dog down the very first day of school.. at the very moment we had to put him down, I was forced to leave because I also had to attend my first day of my  college program and it was mandatory to attend or we would get kicked out. I show up that day at school feeling horrible. I didn’t wear the correct shoes because I was rushing to get ready and I got points deducted. I made it through the day to get home to find out they had to put my dog down and I saw his little body in a casket. the next day I had to go to the hospital for the start of the program.to make matters worse, it was one of the busiest trauma  hospital in the state. I felt so bad. So sad. So lost. I only had one choice. To be numb. I somehow managed to put myself aside and focus on the program and excel. A few months before graduation, my best friend gets diagnosed with a deadly cancer nce, is forced to drop out of the program. And here I am, helping her through it, while I also die inside because of how much pain I feel seeing someone I love go through it. I have tests, I have a job lined up. My citizenship ceremony coming up. Good things happening yet, I feel numb. My sister got married a few weeks ago, her best friend confessed he was always in love with me and liked me. I asked to take things slow because I am going through so much , which I explained and he said he liked me, so much. he flew back down. Introduced me to his family, treated me like I was his, introduced me to his cousins like his gf. And before he was leaving, Confessed he just didn’t feel the same as I did. My sister said this man lead me on. how can someone be so cruel. Use and abuse me knowing I’m weak. I didn’t know people could be this cruel. I have never felt this depressed before. This useless, worthless. I can usually fight my demons. But this time I feel so tired. I have faught so hard. I can’t fight anymore. these next 4 days seem impossible. I wish I could afford therapy. I wish I had someone to talk to, to help me through these next 4 days. 


 One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people.

He said, ""My son, the battle is between two ""wolves"" inside us all.

One is Evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.

The other is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.""

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather: ""Which wolf wins?""

The old Cherokee simply replied, ""The one you feed.""


- you guys… what wolf is winning with you?..",1
Am I not enough?,"Last year I had to take a break from school for mental health reasons. I questioned my career choices and went on a journey to find myself.

What I discovered during this time though, is something that has deeply affected me.

I noticed during my break that people began to treat me as though I was quite literally a trash can.  
Particularly my family - felt like I was of absolutely no use.

They would tease me for being useless, they would roll their eyes and ask ""what have you done the whole week?"". They would tell me I had wasted potential, and that I was dumb and lazy.

I understand that they were worried about my future, but I can't shake the feeling of how worthless I had become in their eyes.  
And it's made me think that, the world has become such a hollow place, that we are no longer happy and grateful to just be alive.  
We have to BE something - we have to DO something.   


I realised that unless I DO great things, and become a great person, my family and friends are not proud of who I am as a person.  


Unless I get a good job, and make good money, I am not worthy of being a good person.  


I am now back at school and everyone acts as if nothing had happened. But I am struggling to forget the way the people I love the most treated me when I was classed as an almost high school drop out.

And this feeling is making me really really depressed. I am feeling so depressed because I've realised that I will always have to force myself to achieve great things in order to please the people I love.

And I know people will say that I should only do things for my own happiness - and not for the sake of other people.  
But I've tried doing that - and it only made me feel worse. Because It's such a horrible feeling to be considered as a 'low life' in the eyes of family and friends.

The pressure is unbearable. I can finish high school. But then I'll have to get my degree. And after that I'll have to find a good job and be promoted to make my way to the top.  
When does this all end though? When can I finally be good enough to be loved unconditionally?",1
I can feel myself slipping,"I can feel myself slipping back and i am so scared.

Im just in a constant cycle recently and i dont know what the cause is.
Im on zoloft and take an as needed med for panic attacks but it seems to not be helping at the moment and i am just desperate for relief, i just want to live my life and not have to consistently worry about this and having to bounce back when it happens

"My depression is affecting my memory and attention, I feel terrible","Hi, English is not my first language, so I may commit a few mistakes.

I had a neuropsychological test and It said that my cognitive functions are affected because of my OCD and depression, also due to brain immaturity, so it's hard for me to control my impulses and manage my emotions.

Now I am feeling terrible, If I don't feel obsessive, I feel depressed, my focus is terrible, I am making cognitive stimulation excercises to improve my cognitive functions, what else can I do to improve?, thanks.",1

i don't wanna be around people at school, i don't wanna be in a place where i don't feel like i belong, i don't wanna bend over backwards to please everyone. i don't wanna get up ever again i just want to sleep until i'm okay.

I've grown tired putting a mask on everyday just so I can get through the day, the fake smile, fake happiness, all to just crumble at night.  I used to believe I had a purpose but  not anymore.  I have no sense of direction let alone the will to keep fighting, I crave the peace, the tranquility.  I don't wish to have anyone around me because I don't know what is real and what is not.  No human should have to be told and treated so unkindly, maybe I deserve it.  Maybe all of the ugly things that has been done to me has changed me into a horrible human being.  The person who has been the doormat to so many finally has worn so thin I'm about to break.  Wipe your feet one more time and that's when the last thread will snap and I'll finally be no more.

31 year old in a chronic slump,"I humbly request your constructive critiques and enlightening perspectives. My aim is to find my path. 

When I am asked what I want to do with my life, I come up blank. At 31 years of age, having spent the majority of my life in the First World in a series of traumatic and unstable circumstances, I feel like all the drive and passion has been squished out of me. I am in a more supportive environment nowadays, but the healing has not come at the pace I would have hoped. Let me walk you through how I got here.

Growing up on the East coast of the USA in the 1990s, the first thing I remember wanting to be ""when I grow up"" was a paleontologist. I was part of the peak Jurassic Park generation. In my youngest years I took it for granted that someday I would wear Sam Neil's hat and fly around the world discovering new dinosaur species for fun and profit. In between days at elementary school I would memorize information about hundreds of dinosaur species, play video games with dinosaurs, and watch any shows or movies with dinosaurs I could get my hands on.

This all changed practically overnight when my parents' immigration issues came back to bite us all. In 2000, my mother was deported back to Pakistan and ended taking me and my elder brother with her. After several more complications, including 9/11, my father flew across the ocean to take me away from her. He justified this as saying I needed to be raised as a ""real man"" in the country that was my ""birthright"". The trouble was, he was a serial abuser and a drunk, as well as every kind of problematic -ist and -phobe you can imagine.

We moved to the suburbs of Atlanta in late 2003.

In the first months I spent alone with him I forgot all about the idea of having my own goals for my life. He trained me very quickly to trust him and absolutely nobody else. He hovered over me and breathed down my neck at every turn. He kept me just as isolated as he kept himself; he never worked a salaried job and instead spent his time flipping second-hand goods online.

I never worked up the confidence to initiate conversations at school with other kids. I never went out of my way to do extra-curricular activities. I never even got out of my shell online. I communicated with my siblings and my mother abroad, and that was pretty much it.

I simply did my assignments, kept my head down as much as I could, and returned home as quickly as possible. My dad forced me to partake in some intramural sports but eventually I learned I could get away with hiding in the bathroom until it was time to board the bus home. I developed a habit of doing the bare minimum to eke through life. The few friends I did have were not much more than video game buddies. I didn't talk about things with them besides games and movies. This pattern stayed more or less consistent until I graduated from high school.

My high school graduation in 2010 left me in a new level of depression. I can physically feel the effects of it to this day, 13 years later. I think it was because the little bit of life I had built up was being taken from me, and I was more than ever expected to develop myself into an ""adult"" despite never having internally had the chance to advance from a little kid to a teenager. I still feel stunted in that way.

College was a more lonely experience for me than anything before. More academically demanding, and with even less prospect of any reward. I was originally a mechanical engineering major during the first two years I took my core classes, but once the actual engineering classes kicked in I was not able to hack it. 

By late 2012 I had started binge-drinking every night at the encouragement of my increasingly unstable father, with whom I was still living alone. After my first involuntary psychiatric hospitalization I had to switch majors to something easier (history) and remain in the university so my father could save face and say that he had a son attending a prominent American institute of higher education.

My drinking escalated and I spent more of my time in a reclusive state. I never volunteered or did any internships. I did the bare minimum needed to pass my classes, then I would disappear home in my room surrounding by cockroaches and  my drunk and abusive father. I would bury myself in the same video games over and over, frequently watching the same YouTube videos over and over (I was obsessed with RedLetterMedia among others). My ""job"" at this time was to do minor adminstrative tasks to support my father's home business of flipping items on Amazon. But then the site changed its policies to the FBA system in late 2015/early 2016, which effectively put him out of business and forced us both to become Uber drivers.

When it finally came time to graduate from university at the end of 2016, my mind was utterly fried by all the events of that year, as well as my escalating alcoholism. I was binge drinking every night and mixing this with cannabis as well as anti-depressants. I was attending utterly fruitless counseling and psychiatry sessions. The turning point came when I admitted SI to my psychiatrist and got involuntarily hospitalized in the psych ward for the second time. I was so insecure about my likelihood of graduation and prospects afterward that I decided it would be better to end it.

I ended up graduating from university while sitting in the psych ward. This was at the end of 2016.

A few weeks later my mother was finally able to come and rescue me from the hands of my father who kept me to himself for all those years. I lived with her in Maryland for about two years, with the generous help of her cousin who has a position of esteem within a local religious community. But I was still drinking, to the point that I was having loud panic attacks in my job as a hospital case management assistant in late 2018. I got put on short-term disability leave, just long enough to finally kick the habit of drinking, an abstinence I have dutifully maintained to this day and which I will continue for the remainder of my life.

It was at that point that I was finally able to move to Toronto, where I have lived since early 2019. I do not exaggerate when I say it is only with the generosity of my sister that I am not currently inhabiting a spot in a tent city and regularly visiting food banks. I am haunted by this possibility every day.

The first year I lived here, 2019, I was still in heavy withdrawal from my alcoholism of six years. Through a social services agency I was able to find a part-time job as a dishwasher, followed some months after by a short stint as a light-duty cleaner at the airport. However this was disrupted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I spent the next year sitting at home and pulling my hair out. I did not go to the gym like I regularly used to, and gained significant amounts of weight as a result. My cannabis use escalated to a major crutch.

It was in 2021, however, that my income peaked. Due to the province's orders for PCR testing, I was able to find an entry-level position as an assistant in a PCR test processing facility. It was in this year that I made about $36,000 working full-time. I wish I could approach that level again. Unfortunately the contract ended coinciding with the province's roll-back of PCR testing eligibility. So I was back on my bottom again. I decided to go back to the gym regularly, this time with a mask. I needed to do that to gain some sense of regulation for my brain and control over my waistline.

I then found a remote job working as a medical scribe, where I have remained ever since early 2022. It's part-time and minimum wage, with no possibilities for advancement.

Late last year I was diagnosed with autism. This was followed about a month later by my father passing away. He was alone and drunk in an AirBnB because he could not afford a real home.

A few months ago I finally quit my cannabis use, a habit which I started before drinking. It just wasn't doing anything nice anymore. Dry and anxious, that's all.

At this point I really do not know what I want to do or what career I want to have. I feel so behind at 31 years of age, compared to even people half my age. Other people on average have more tech-savvy, self-awareness, soft skills, life experiences, and social connections than I feel like I can ever possibly have at this point.

What are the options for me here in Toronto? I have limited social skills, no reliable access to a car (I use TTC if I need to go anywhere, or hitch a ride with my sis), and few marketable skills or life experiences in general due to my chronic isolation and trauma experiences. 

Sometimes I think it would be nice to work as an office cleaner, so I can listen to audiobooks and podcasts while working. It's not like my college degree has helped any.

"i haven't been diagnosed, but i'm pretty sure that i'm depressed. can anyone help?","note: typing this in school since i cant get over the thought lol. 

since about 2020 i've had horrible thoughts about POSSIBLY ending my life, although they are extreme i'm pretty positive about now that i'm not going to do anything to myself, i'm too much of a wuss. i've talked to a counselor/therapist before but it wasn't for diagnosis or anything, all he said was that i need to start getting more sleep and things like that (which i failed to do i only get about 3-5 hours of sleep everyday which is so stressful with being in school). like for instance this morning i woke feeling worse than i have in about 2 weeks, it was so bad to the point where i had to do laps around the house to wake myself up. i also have extreme anxiety (which i haven't been diagnosed with either) but i sometimes feel almost completely disconnected with reality itself lmao, im kinda laughing about rn cause it's crazy think about but anyway. if anyone could give me some tips or something please do or you have any questions for me please ask. i almost feel lost in life at this point even though i'm very young (i just turned 18).",1

I'm stuck in my bed writing this post when I should be in class, trying to get knowledge to have my degree. I fucking can't. I keep telling myself ""it's okay, it's gonna be okay, nothing bad will happen, there's no tests, it's just going to class and taking notes, nothing else"" but I just can't do it, when I NEED to go. The only thing I manage to do is eat some random things, sometimes shower. But I can't do anything else. I feel so terrible about myself for not being able to JUST GO TO CLASS.",1

All my other family is across the world, and even when I get a chance to see them I feel like a black sheep.Even when I’m with my friends it always seems like I’m always the one caring more for them and i feel like im only around when they’re in need. I’ve been coupled up in my room for weeks, I’ve skipped classes for 3 weeks. And im currently writing this at school but im not going in cause I just can’t. Im only here because I had a fight with my dad earlier (I haven’t slept). I’ve also never experienced love ( im 19) everyone around me has and I’ve never had anymore take interest in me. I’m overweight, I have acne. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t stop crying.

I do suffer with depression, ADHD and anxiety and WFH has really made it harder for me to socialize and find friends.

Idk anymore,"Idk if this is depression but I didn’t know where else to post, recommend me somewhere if I’m on the wrong page for this

I feel sad all the time. I think it because of the change that’s happened in that past couple of months. I finished high school and started college, i didn’t really have friend friends in high school but I knew a lot of people and was never alone. 

Now I’m always alone. I mean I have a boyfriend that I see regularly but telling him anything makes my problems feel small idk why and I have my mum and yeah I have friends that I chat with rarely, but i have so much time by myself now, and stuff that’s happened to me in my past has caught up in times I am alone. I’m thinking so much about the people who hurt me and also what I brung amongst myself too. i do nothing with my life, I’ve tried clubs and stuff but I’m so fucking negative in my head to stick them. I hate how I look because I’ve put more weight on and I’m thinking of not eating again. I keep listening to this sad song on repeat that’s so beautiful but heartbreaking.

I know all this won’t last long but idk if this is what it’s like to get older but if it is, it scary and sad and I wish I could go back.",1

My brain is always fighting against me and I just can’t handle the extreme work load without break and I just need unjudged time to catch up and this feels like the only way that will work.i just want advice that will help?.",1
Experience with therapy,"Hi, I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I'm not new to therapy. I changed therapists multiple times when I didn't see their effectiveness. I stopped for a while because I thought it's not for me. I feel hopeless lately, so I started again.

Finally, I found a cognitive therapist. I am so sick of psychoanalysis. It's too slow, and I feel like we never arrive at the problem-solving part. 

My therapist seemed like she would be the one at first, but I'm not sure. We talk about my daily life, my current problems, instead of my past, which is good. I still don't get answers, and I don't know how to control our topics. I think she should do that, not me. It's not like I'm not prepared: I wanted to discuss motivation and executive dysfunction. She just shut it down, saying when I use my meds, we can talk about them. I get this, but I still want to learn something related to my problems. Instead, we were just chatting about my diet and my non-psychological medical conditions, and I feel like I learned nothing.

I'm confused, and I think I'm the one who doesn't know how this works. My idea of therapy was that there is a plan for a diagnosis applied uniquely to the patients. Every session has a goal that we try to resolve together, and then some discussion about how I implemented in my life what I learned from the previous session. A little bit like a course with the freedom to stay on some specific lessons longer.

I get it now that I'm wrong. Could you explain to me how it works? And please tell me how to get the best out of my therapy!",1
I lost everything,"I'm 29 (f) and over the last year I got fired from my dream job, broke up with my boyfriend of 6 years, got kicked out of the band I loved being in, got rejected by my best friend who I fell in love with, and lost numerous friends due to the erratic ways I behaved during the middle of it all.

And now I am an absolute shell of my former self. I feel like I've lost my complete personality. I spend most of my days in bed, which I guess is a slight improvement from the summer, where I attempted SI so many times I lost count.

Now I feel either totally apathetic to everything, or I get punched in the gut by overwhelming grief and loss. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore, and even though I'm interviewing for new jobs in new cities, I feel overwhelmed by the prospect of trying to work full time and at my former capacity.

Will this just...get better with time? How do I deal with so much loss? I hate feeling like a subhuman",1
My family keeps telling me to not be sad anymore.,"I don't know what to do. I'm 28 and am sad daily. I'm on 3 antidepressants and my mom and sisters keep telling me to be happy. I don't know how to be happy.

Is it actually useful to reach out?,"In my experience it hasn't been. I was diagnosed with depression my sophmore year of High School but I definitely was depressed before then. I went through 5 different therapists over 2 years who all told me the same generic advice. Random pseudo scientific ways to calm down. I would tell them my problems and they never seemed to understand which makes sense as I am neurodivergent and they weren't. Now being almost a adult and cooped up in a room doing College and feel like shit, I feel no reason to reach out to my friends. Even if it meant my untimely death I wouldn't, they cannot understand my feelings and they never will. They can understand close approximations but my feelings do not make sense to regular people. And even if they did, what would come of it. They arent going to spill some great life secret that solves everything or even mitigates the pain I feel, its all platitudes which is nice but ultimately unhelpful. It also just complicates things, I am annoyed that the way people percept me is ultimately out of my control and to tell my friends that I want to Die just makes that anxiety worse.",1
Do you tell your friends that you suffer from depression?,"I've been wondering if I'm the only one that lost a lot of friends throughout my depression journey, due to me stop socializing, not going out and not telling them that all of those are caused by my depression.

I still have deeply shame of my mental illness, I feel like even if people knew they wouldn't get not be able to move out of bed for weeks. It upsets me even more when mentally healthy people are like ""depression is not real, you're just being lazy"" it's just makes me to get even more closed to myself.",1
Disconnected,"I have friends but I feel disconnected w them 
. Where can I make a real connection? Makes me wanna reach out w the ex. I cant go on like this for a long time.

Dating app - i hate it but i keep giving it a chance

Some friends are busy w their lives (lovelife)
Some seem like living their best lives

I hate being myself,"I really do hate being myself. Not in a I hate myself sort of way (which is not entirely untrue) but I can't stand myself sometimes. I have such a hard time opening up to people because for some reason (trauma lol) I have it hardwired in my brain that I am a burden and not worthy of feeling good. I am trying to get out of that mindset, but it's hard sometimes.

For example, today, I was having a hard time and really just wanted to talk to someone I trust. However I came to the realization about a week ago that my so called ""friends"" don't like me (fact based with proof), and the guy I'm kinda talking to isn't responding as fast and as detailed (?) As he used to, so I don't really have anyone to talk to about anything really atm. I can't help but think I'm the problem and I just need to try harder and be more social, which is easier said then done. It's times like this I really do ""feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again"". I'm trying my best not to wallow in self pity but sometimes I just gotta have a good cry and accept the fact I'm never going to be good enough for myself.",1
Empty,"Just a little rant since I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I’m 31m , my whole family is gone, like dead.  I took care of my dad from when I was 16 when he was diagnosed with cancer to 29 when he had cardiac arrest one day in his chair I did cpr but he got to the hospital brain dead so I had to take him off life support. My dad was the milkman’s so I never knew my gpa on his side and his mom died at 54 when I was 2 , He was an only child. My moms dad died when I was 7, my gma on her side never liked me and didn’t come around she died in 2017. Essentially I have no uncles/cousins/brothers/sisters, nobody. It hit hard this last thanksgiving eating takeout by myself for the 3rd year.
 To make matters worse my 12 year old dog is dying and I just can’t take any more death. It was bad enough it took a year and a half after my dad died to not spontaneously cry and being suicidal. I have no kids and never had a gf. I live paycheck to paycheck basically. Couldn’t afford the thought of dating. I spent 18-23 as an alcoholic/addict, Vicodin, Weed, Xanax. That lifestyle caught up in the form of gout and a dad bod that’s isn’t going anywhere. Maybe I made made choices in that regard but I would still be in this position. Im trying to finish a degree but I don’t think more money will solve my problems.",1

People trying to ‘help’,"I don’t understand why the first things to say are either something along the lines of ‘it’ll get better’ or, even worse, anything that brings up other people. I just hate it, especially when people who know the details of my mental state say it because it’s so obvious they don’t take me seriously. I know it’s typical to say that I’m a ‘special case’ and that I’ll never get better, but I’m not saying that. My issues are just more complex than self pity or hatred or even trauma, but if I share any of that to ‘regular’ mentally ill people then they villainize me anyway. 

I don’t feel empathy. I know I don’t, I know I never did, and that will never, ever change. My therapist (formerly my parent’s therapist and handpicked by them) has definitely been told a lot of things about me that are not true. My mother is a former therapist, and she’s unfortunately a competent manipulator. (She hated listening to people, that’s why it’s former lol.) 

I know she’s painted a picture of me that has never existed, but I’m fully powerless to do anything. She hates the idea of taking responsibility for how she’s treated me in the past, and if we acknowledge my obviously severe mental issues, she can’t escape from it. When I got diagnosed with PTSD she was so angry with me. She’s convinced I’m faking anything more severe than some reasonable depression and maybe generalized anxiety, but truth is I think there may be something actually wrong with me. This isn’t a self pitying statement.. I’m psychologically fucked and I know it. I just guess I’ll never find out, because I honestly don’t see a point. My life ended a long time ago and my body is just catching up. 

I just don’t understand why other people think that I care about my friends or family when I contemplate suicide. I won’t even leave a note, or a clean room, or a ‘less traumatizing’ scene. None of that matters to me and I’m glad it’s that way. I gave up on any future plans or goals years ago and everybody can tell, they just don’t believe that it’s because I’m veering on the edge. To them I’m just lazy, and in a way I’m pretty grateful for that.",1
Uni break is over and I can't do it,"I feel like I'm in this constant loop of starting a school year, thinking I can do it, shit gets too hard and realizing I'm the same educational failure I'll always be. Just had Thanksgiving break and spent most of it thinking about the fact that when I come back it's all huge finals and exams, watching at least a decent grade that took pretty much everything I got about to tumble down to a near failing one because of one assignment I can't muster any motivation or intelligence to complete.

I got back on Monday and have skipped all my classes the first two days of school because I'm on the verge of the worst panic attack. I've been twitching, shaking, biting myself, and my boyfriend's going through his first ever uni-related episode of depression and stress (on top of BPD I'm absolutely confident he has), he has said to my face he can't handle my depression and ""just needs me right now"", as in to take care of him. 

We almost got in to a car crash the other night and I just keep wishing it killed me honestly.",1
"diagnosed mild depression, can't handel my emotions.","I am 28 Female. I have completed my bachelor's degree in 2019. Don't have any job experience at all till now. Came to Finland in 2021. gave 1 year for Finnish language class, and constantly applying for job. Feels like i am applying job just to get one a rejection email nothing else. I was getting emotionally week before I came here . But it was getting worse by the mid of 2023. I was physically very week . I took every test and nothing was wrong in my body. I was lying myself and hiding from my husband how worse i have got emotionally. I would start crying if my husband would just mention about my carrier. even there is not any argument at all. We are very happy couple, aside my job carrier everything is just perfect in our life.
 I finally confess to my doctor that when ever i feel sad and think about different situations in my carrier my body starts to pain, specially my legs. Am i cry even in simplest argument. I was not person like that  few years back. I cried a lot when i was saying this to doctor. He said I had mild depression. Getting emotional anxiety, feeling worthless, getting anxious was routine in every 2 weeks for me. I took anti depression medicine for 7 months. 
Right now i am doing internship at a college but this ends in two months.
Yesterday i got two rejection form job application. I was not feeling very good but i tried my best to stay positive. Later evening my husband was trying to motivate me to work for more hours and work hard. I couldn't control. I got emotional breakdown. He didn't even said directly. He was soo polite and honest but i couldn't handel , felt like something really bad emotions are coming out of my herat and i have to cry it out. And now i will go through at least 3 unproductive days. And this will happen again in few weeks. I am trapped into this loop , get emotionally week, cry a lot even in simple conversation about my carrier, get depressed, go through unproductive days again and achieve nothing Even after 6 months. 
How do I make my self emotionally strong and not cry at every time i have discussion about my carrier?",1
Seasonal depression while on antidepressants?,"This is my first holiday season since starting antidepressants, so far they’ve had an amazing impact on my day to day. Going into Christmas though I’m starting to feel that familiar feeling kinda looming over me. I’m sure it also has to do with the fact that this is my first holiday since losing my grandfather in July but I’m starting to feel just lost. Is it normal to feel like this even when taking the antidepressants? Is there anything I can do to help cope with it?",1
Sometimes I hope to be afflicted with a terminal illness.,"Despite how much I may want my life to be over, part of me knows that I will never actually build up the courage to actually end it myself. So instead, sometimes I find myself thinking about having some kind of fatal disease. That way, it would be out of my control. No way I could chicken out or change my mind.
It would hopefully be something not particularly painful or debilitating, just something that gives me an end date, something that would allow me to let go. I somehow feel that knowing it was actually coming might finally allow me some calm, allow me to use up the time I had left without worrying about the future.
I'm probably wrong of course, but who knows.",1

Meaningless,"Hello, good gents and ladies. I shall declare that I finally drowned in the darkness inside of me. Drowned in self accusations. Clearing head, increasing altitude and falling down again.

starting to loose touch to reality,"So, I live in India and Recently turned 16yo. This all started with my parents separation(Note am saying seperation not divorced) in 2011, they had a big fight which led to my father leaving the house and not turning up for another 4 years. because of this i had no father which led to a broken family in a broken house. Fights started happening in my house b/w my elder brother and mother these fights were physical and mental both i always intervened which led to my brother hating me and beating me everyday while my mother was at office, he even once almost chocked me to death, because of all this i tried to commit suicide when i was 11 or 10 and from then i ams till a suicidal maniac idk how many times i have tried cause i am a coward. My father came home and they still fought then my father left again in2020 for a job he came back in 2022 and a miracle happened my mother and father started to hang out laugh and talk together, i was so happy but my relations with my mother werent so great cause after my father left again I after 1 month ran away from my house because of a fight. And guess what my mother and father started to fight again cause he blamed my mother. 

&#x200B;

now i am a 16yo with no friends suffering from depression and anxiety and i did any desperate person would do i started imagining meaning delusions. I was finaly feeling happy even though for some time only. Because of excessive delusionality I have lost touch to reality I start talking and keep creating fake scenarios out of nowhere. I seriously need help cause after effects of delusions arent great. Nobody knows about my current situation

i feel pathetic,"a little bit about me, i’m 23yo and i think i’ve been struggling for 3/4 years now. it started when i was 19, i developed an ed after a break up, i wasn’t aware at first. i just stopped eating, lost weight, liked it and eventually fell into a never ending cycle. at first it was mostly restriction and i felt superior, i had the motivation to do things because i felt like i had control over myself and everything. it was further from the true, i was slowly losing myself. then came the binges, the guilt, the weight gain and the same. i can’t get out of this cycle and a part of me doesn’t allow me to get out of it. it started to affect everything, i stopped my studies for 2 years because i was too self conscious with my issues and my body, started to withdraw myself from my friends, lost a lot of people on the run. and now, here i am, trying to get better but i’m just getting worse. i started new studies but decided to do it at home, i’m feeling too ugly, too fat, too useless to go out and face the world. i made new friends but i always cancel on every plans because i’m scared they will see me like i see myself. i am in my room 24/7, still live with my parents (that i love dearly). i have no hobbies, literally none, no motivation to work out, to do better, to study. i’m late in so many assignments but i can’t never bring myself to do the work. i wake up and just to do nothing, like at all. i’m supposed to be studying for my driver license too and i keep on procrastinating and ignoring. school, friends, my health, everything i’m just ignoring it all. and it’s eating me alive, i don’t want this at all for me. i have so many dreams but i’m hopeless, i want to be able to drive and get my degree, move out and have a social life. i’m so unmotivated, lazy, i feel ungrateful and useless. like i have no ambitions for myself. i’m too tired to even give up, i can’t explain it. nothing matters but everything matters. i don’t know if it’s depression or just me, but i’m really sad and wish i had something for myself, i truly feel like i have nothing good in me.",1

my partner is the only one who can pull me out of my episodes,"for context, i’ve been diagnosed for 8 years and it has been a long battle. i recently was in a pretty heavy episode, not being able to get out of bed, feed myself, brush my teeth, pretty much the usual for me. i was receiving support from my friends which i really really appreciated, and my partner said he’d come over to help me with my laundry pile that’s nearly as tall as me. well that didn’t happen as he had an emergency with his family and he didn’t have access to his car, so by the grace of god i was able to get out of bed, brush my teeth, and drive myself over. i stayed with him all day, still in a funk, but by the time i was ready to go home i felt okay. why is it that he’s the only one who can really cheer me up and pull me out of these episodes? no matter what i try to do for myself it seems to just barely work, and same with other people in my life. do i rely on him too much?",1
What to do….,"What do you do if you just don’t want to continue anymore? I try my best to keep positive and try to work towards changing my life and my goals, but I just no longer have the will to live anymore. I am tired. I am constantly surrounded by people who don’t care who the real me is. They want to see me how they want, and treat me how they want, and assert their convoluted way of thinking on to me. Just because you would doesn’t mean I would. I guess I am naive person because when someone says they care I believe it, or when someone says “it’s fine” I believe it. I just can’t take life anymore. It’s overwhelming. I’m tired. I just want comfort. I am surrounded by coldness. Even though there are people around me. I feel more lonely with them, than I ever feel alone.",1
Medication vacation,"My mental health provider took me off my antidepressant last week for a medication vacation. He couldn’t have done it at a worse time. I just had a big birthday that I cried through, and I cried through Thanksgiving.

I can see myself crying through Christmas too.

What can I take that’s OTC to make this stop?",1
I can’t think straight,"I feel numb and overwhelmed with anxiety at the same time. I keep trying to find reasons to push through, but the idea of living like this is unbearable. I wish there was silence and darkness. I am so incredibly exhausted. Finishing the energy to push through is so hard. I think of my family, but I feel like a shell. I feel like I’m just going through life without any true happiness. My thoughts are all over the place.",1
feel guilty for existing on the dime of my parents and my partner,"Reposted from r/offmychest

Basically the title

I struggle to hold down jobs due to long term mental health issues. Might be a breakthrough with a new diagnosis? I have a good degree but I struggled to finish it and only managed with support from my college. It has been a long time since graduating. My parents know I'm struggling and they give me a monthly stipend which is enough to pay the mortgage and live on. My partner pays his half and is also very supportive. All are at least on the surface happy for me to just exist while I try and put up a front of a normal life.

I see friends, we try out new restaurants and cafes, we go on holidays to far away places with friends. I am endlessly reconciling this facade of a life I live while knowing I am a burden to everyone (yet everyone is very kind and I still have friends and supportive family and siblings I talk to about these issues). My sibling says our parents feel good for helping out as they have plenty of means to do so.

Therapist says that if my parents were actually looking out for my best interests they would cut me loose. I do wonder what I would do then. Theoretically it would mean selling the house and going to a cheaper cost of living place or moving back in with my parents. I don't know if I would just give up at that point. But maybe I would manage. But maybe I should also just give up now? 

I hear from everyone I know that work productivity isn't the worth of a human being. In my mind is the societal judgement. I think I would feel better if I was productive in any sense, but can't even focus on any hobby cos it loses my attention. And when I watch entertainment passively I eventually feel so guilty that I exist like this.

 I manage to semi look after the house, but this is very minor as we have no kids. I wonder if having kids would be enough fulfillment. I'm worried about having kids and having no stable career to go back to. Friends are saying that career can be started at any time and that isn't something to worry about.

It does resonate in my mind that maybe all I need is a kick up the backside like my parents cutting me off to trigger some sort of breakthrough in life, like the struggle is what will keep me going. Is this actually true? Does struggle make the person? Can work be actually something that isn't just restlessly waiting for the clock to reach half 5? 

I'm just feel stressed from existing. I feel burnt out. When I was working it was even more overwhelming. 

I don't know what I want from posting this, but it makes me feel better typing it all out. Sorry that this is a very privileged perspective. I am aware of how lucky I am every day.",1
I keep losing people,"I think there hasn't been a time I lost so many people than in the last 10 months. It all culminated this last weekend, when two good friends of mine decided to cut me off after a depressive episode I had. I'm always supportive of people doing what they thinks is best for them and their health, but I just... can't ignore the pain. Today I woke up crying because I miss them, so much. Why am I so good at making people leave me?",1
I’m so done with feeling like I have failed at life.,"I’m 32 M and im so done with feeling unloved, unwanted and like a failure. I’ve had to move back home with one of my parents once again because I had to quit my job because of situations. I have had enough of feeling like a complete failure. The one girl I have ever loved left me for my best friend, who always said he was gay(obviously not) I then went into a spiral of depression that I used drink and drugs to cope with and all my other “friends” weren’t there for me and just left me to get worse now I don’t trust anyone and just want the pain to end. What do I do?",1
"Struggling with ""College is some of the best time in your life"" syndrome.","Wrapping up with college next semester and I'm very happy to get out. But it's hard to look at life improving after this. I keep getting the same conversation from my family, which is ""Well I had the best time of my life at college, and everything gets worse after that"". See the thing is, I've probably had the worst four years of my life in school here. Aside from meeting my girlfriend, who is the only person I can trust these days, school consisted of fake friends and people who ended up showing their ugly side the longer you knew them. I had a specific roommate for the last few years who started out fine, but has slowly turned out to be terrible and ended up ruining other friendships of mine. I clearly learned my lesson with ""don't room with your friends"".  I feel utterly lost and confused. Aside from a degree and hopefully a job after I graduate, I'm left with this emptiness, with no true memories and happiness associated with university. I feel like every time I had a good thing going here, it found a way to somehow get blocked or ruined. I am lonely. And again, since my parents and many others think college was their favorite time ever, I can't even imagine how I will go about things after May. I can recognize that things will get better, but it's hard to when so much time has been spent sad, despite trying so hard to get out of it. ",1
Depression and loneliness,"I'm sure many can relate to this,  for those who are severely depressed for a long time. Loneliness makes depression worse or even can cause it, we know that. But do you find that even when you attempt to do things to end this loneliness such as make friends or talk to people, do activities you just can't? Not really anyway. Like there's just something missing from you and you no longer have the ability to connect to people or enjoy anything. It just feels like a vicious cycle and I don't know how to break it...

For some more context on my own personal situation: I am severely depressed since childhood, have several other mental illness and chronic condition that means I've never really been able to live a ""normal"" life. I've stayed with my parents the whole 27 years of my life and probably will live with them forever since moving is obviously unaffordable especially for the disabled. Never finished college or went to uni because of my health. I cannot drive because of health. I really find myself even struggling to get my thoughts together well enough to speak to people properly these days... sometimes I feel like I have actual brain damage from prolonged isolation. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents and everything they have done for me but of course some people cannot really be themselves and feel natural around their parent figures. And that in itself is tiresome.",1
I lost myself,"For about a solid year now I’ve been struggling feeling like I have a purpose. When I look at myself in the mirror I don’t recognize who I am. I’m 25, when I was in my early to mid teens I suffered from severe anxiety and depression that led to my almost successful suicide. Luckily I was able to find a sense of purpose again, and learned how to love myself ( kinda ) I just knew how to cope with it in my own way. 

Fast forward to now, I began drinking I began using substances. I feel like I’ve dug myself into a deeper hole than ever but I’ve been so oblivious to who I’ve become. My girlfriend has been telling me for over year now that I’ve changed that she’s lost connection to me. Deep down I felt like I’ve lost touch with myself as well but I just ignore it and I don’t know. I don’t even know how to express my feelings and thoughts to her I feel like I’m a passenger looking through the eyes of a man I don’t know. Today was an eye opener, I felt this overwhelming feeling of sadness. I miss who I used to be, I miss staying true to my values and ethics. I really don’t know where to start. I feel trapped. Like my soul has no flame.",1
35m worst depression I've ever had,"I few days ago I has this random thought pop into my head, that was remembering how much I've missed out on in life so far. That's what started it. Now a few days later i have stomach pains when I think about certain things. My main issue is I'm 35 yo and I've never had a gf and still a virgin.

Help,"Is this the best way to commit suicide?

Hi everyone,

I don’t need convincing that my life is worth living or any of that. I’m ready to die and that’s final. I love swimming and the ocean and I want a way that ensures if I fail I will not have permanent damage so I’ve thought of drowning myself. 

I would fly to an island called Gozo take enough sleeping pills to be sleepy and calm and then just go ‘swimming’. Would you say this is a good way to kill my self? I’m not bothered about it being painless it just has to work and if it doesn’t I’m not left with permanent injuries.",1

Im not living i am only surviving and i tried all my life to be happy but it feels like im not allowed to be happy or get a win. I cry every day. I dont deserve this.,1
Hi,"When i was a kid I didnt know what my plan would be when i graduated. It was like i had no purpose outside of school. Because my kid self thought i would have no future. I decided that when i turn 18 i would just kill myself. Now im 21 and those thoughts never really crossed my mind as they have this year. Its a weekly thing where i just imagine myself grabbing my dads shotgun and blowing my head off. My friend keeps nagging me about getting a gun and his reasoning is how will i defend myself if i get robbed. But little does he know there's a big reason why i don't want one. I will use it on myself eventually. I still have no interest in anything in life. I still think i have mo future, I've failed at the military anf I've failed at college. My mom and ny dad were never married and pretty much separated all my life and they both say they're hoping im gonna be the one that actually makes it out of all my 7 other siblings. They dont know how hopeless i am. I just wish i could restart this whole life thing. I have no skills or hobbies besides work, game and sleep. Its not like i dont have friends either. I have a ton of people that care about me and check up on me but somehow i still feel so alone. All of these thoughts go away, most of the time, when im hanging out with them. Maybe its just a facade that i dont even realize im doing. I also have a girlfriend that loves me so much, but for some reason I still want to just live another life. I hate my life but have no reason to hate it. Am i just selfish? Am I just being a pussy? I dont know what to do and i genuinely think my life will end in suicide at some point in my life. Really the only thing stopping me is my dad. I'd hate to have to put all of that on him. It just wouldnt be fair, he probably has the same thoughts i do. Im probably yhe reason he hasnt done it. Who woulda thunkd. But yeah, theres my beans. Spilled all over reddit. Enjoy",1
(rant) cant be fucked,"i cant be fucked to see a psychologist or psychiatrist, they’re expensive and the process of repeating myself and my problems again constantly tires me. i understand they have many clients but when every session they forget about what theyve told me and what i have to say it drains me and reminds me that they really dont care.

i cant be fucked to talk about my feelings and problems to the people i know irl as they are already dealing with their own problems and the last thing they would want is to hear another person’s. i know this because i have heard my friends rant about how they dislike their friends for talking about their depression/will to live because they stated it was annoying, selfish and everyone goes thru shit.

i cant be fucked to be positive in my life because whenever i make progress or think i do, i feel like i immediately go back to square one. whenever i look forward to things itll always go wrong. 

i dont actively want to die bc its expensive (for my family) and i am scared of pain, but i dont want to actively live either. im tired of hearing people say im running away from my problems when i tried to face them as hard as i could but now i just cant handle it anymore. they all think im ok just because i dont do forms of self harm that will scar and i dont talk about my true self. i just want someone irl to notice me and let me know im enough. im too hung up on being seen as the perfect child, partner, friend and worker. 

i apologise for writing so much, i just wanted to rant. thank you if anyone has read this far.",1

Can your depression be linked to a geographical location?,"There is a place where I've lived for several years during which I've suffered from severe depression.

My depression isn't related to that place per se, I just happened to be living there when it was the most severe. Objectively speaking, it is a fine place to live.

It has been several years of moving to a difference place. Soon, I may be revisiting that place for professional purpose. And when I think about the details of that place (the roads, the view, the shops I went to, the weather), I feel like my depression immediately comes back again. Even though non of those details aren't inherently depressing at all, they evoke the depressed sensation I had while I was living there.

Now that my depression isn't as bad as it was back then (improved medical treatment and more life experience), will I be okay if I go back to that location? Or will my depression reemerge as soon as I am in that place again?",1

I wanna commit suicide,"I'm a 19-year-old who has faced persistent bullying since my school days. Despite entering high school with hopes of a fresh start, I found myself embarrassed and ridiculed, prompting me to withdraw socially. Even in college, the bullying continues, and my attempts to fake depression for reprieve only led to more mockery. I have just one friend, but even she, a people-pleaser, merely gives me a side eye when witnessing the bullying. The toll on my mental health is significant, and neglecting self-care has resulted in physical health problems. The overall impact has left me deeply troubled about my future.",1
I Don't Understand Myself,"Depression is far from a choice yet I can't seem to fight it earnestly. I despise how I feel and I understand why I need to change but I don't. A lot of my depression stems from the anxiety I feel from most subjects relating to my future as a result of my upbringing ( asian American household) , yet I feel like I'm keeping myself in a pit. It's like I fell into a mud pit and I know that being covered in mud is not my fault, but for some reason I don't clean myself off. I don't like how it feels on my skin and I try to wash it off but it's crusted on and it's so difficult I feel like giving up. The thing is I don't know if I lack will power or have become too used to being depressed. Honestly I just feel like inside I don't care anymore, but nothing stays hidden forever and when forced to confront it again I am reminded of the mud on my skin and how much I want it off but the mud still weighs me down. I'm so lost. My parents are sick of me and idk what to do anymore. Life is inherently meaningless unless you give it meaning, but I don't know how to do that. I hide from change and cry when it comes regardless. I fight the current for no reason whatsoever and expect to come out unscathed. I don't know if I'm a fool or just not the right person for the world. I just don't know anything anymore.",1

Issues,"My dad always tells me I am a burden for him and tells me that I ruined his life. I am just a teenager. He always shouts att me and even hits me sometimes. He is a very conservative man and doesn't allow me to be anything other than what he wants me to be. He decides my clothing, my room decor, what I should study, how I should talk< with whom I should communicate with and every little aspect of my life. He even forced me to do a few things that I never wanted to do justj because he believes that religion must be followed. He taunts me and degrades me in front of all our relatives and neighbours, his friends, even in front of our servants. He never respects my wishes and even my birthday is celebrated acc to his wishes and the worst part is I am not allowed to invite any of my friends, nor am I allowed to go out with my friends any time. He tells me I am worthless and that I will not go anywhere in life. He constantly reminds me that every morsel of food I eat is his and even the clothes I wear belong to him. He reads my personal diary and never knocks while entering my room. He goes through my notebooks and my bag. He even checks my phone and logs in to my social media without my permission. And people might think that I am just a teen so he's being caustious but I am already 17 yet he never gives me any space and privacy. He yells at me and hits me and calls me all kinds of dirty names. He always threatens me that he will throw me out on the streets if I ever cross the line. He even asks my mom to hit me somtimes as he just watches and enjoys. I am a published writer and a poet.

He told me all the money he spent on me from when I was born has been wasted and that he wouldn't have let my mum give birth to me if he knew I would turn out to be like this. He takes pride in his false masculinity. His masculinity lies in fear of me and in the way I follow all of his orders like a lil rag doll. I feel so pathetic. He is such a hypocrite. He never helps out in house chores and makes us do everything. If he does anything, even for himself, he calls us all kinds of names under the sun and tells us we are nothing to him just cuz he had to do that one tiny thing for himself. He tells me he has not emotional values for me and he is just fulfilling his social obligations towards me. When we go out and everyone praises me and his upbringing, he points out all the faults in me, infront of everyone and makes jokes about me. Because of him none of my relative give me any respect or value and always ridicule me when I go to family gatherings. I have been diagnoised with c-ptsd, depression and hyper anxiety. I never go for counselling. He makes fun of those issues and when ever I have panic attacks, he makes a joke out of them too. He tells me I am mannerless and an unhinged, crack person when I talk back to his nonsense. He makes me feel so suicidal. I have always loved and looked upto my dad more than anyone in my life.

Realize Just Now,Not a single person in my life has asked me if I’m okay in numerous months. Not my parents or friends.,1
too lazy to wear my retainer,had braces for 3 ish years and a few months ago i just started feeling like shit and didn’t want to be bothered to wear them anymore. didnt help that my room was disgusting and i couldn’t find them for a good bit. now my teeth r starting to look terrible again and i just feel like an idiot for not being able to have any motivation towards my hygiene and appearance,1
how to stop self torturing,i made my mum cry in public in a really bad way and i have since been torturing myself every living second for it to the point where i am going to attempt suicide as the non stop pain and intense anguish will not end. i cannot stop endlessly torturing myself to the brink over what i have done. i have asked her for forgiveness and compassion and she doesn’t want to. she just tells me to shutup and that she doesn’t care. she really doesn’t empathize with my suffering. help,1
Would it be better if I just ended my life?,"Ik dealing with someone’s depression can be a lot and really draining, and I’m someone who always needs someone to help me or I’m prob gonna do something bad to myself, but it’s u fair of me to be draining the ppl I love, like yes it would be sad for them to lose me, but once it’s done, it’s done, and all they have to deal with is the loss of me, which they would get over, everyone gets over the death of a love one, but it may take a while, but if I stay alive I’m just hurting them and draining them everyday for the rest of my life, or unless i actually get better, so far there are no signs of improvement in my mental state, I have just learned to fake smile longer, but at night I’m still unable to hold it down, so again I ask, is it better for me to just leave? It saves me and everyone else prolonged pain, and please if someone answers this, don’t give me the standard “please don’t go everyone would rather deal with it then lose u” comment, I want an actual logical answer to this, actually think abt it and get back to me, thank u, have a good night",1
I can't stop thinking about everybody leaving me,"I live in a shity country and all my friends want to leave after finishing uni. but I have a reason because of which I can't leave for next ~20 years,  and I can't change it. I take people leaving me very hard. I still can't forget people that left me years ago. idk what to do",1
I’m scared,"Long ass story, too long to put here in its entirety but I’ll sum it up the best I can. Hopefully there’s no word limit. Not a burner account lol so if anyone I know reads this, hi and can you like not tell anyone please.

Started realizing how depressed I am about three years ago when I first got close to attempting. Probably been going on a lot longer than that but I just didn’t recognize it. Between being pretty isolated basically my entire childhood (fuckin homeschool istg the worst thing thats happened to me) and then COVID in undergrad, I’ve never really felt like I fit in anywhere. I’m the autistic weirdo wherever I go.

Up until last year, I’d almost attempted three times. Once I stood in my kitchen with a knife to my wrist, twice I leaned over a six story drop. About a year ago was the third one. Wasn’t gonna do that to my mom right before Christmas, so I said if by April nothing had changed I was gonna do it.

Well something did change. I met this girl, B, and she fuckin fixed me. For the first time in as long as I could remember, I was actually happy. She was my best friend for a couple months, then I fell in love with her and she’s still my best friend but she means so much more to me than that. And then next thing I knew, it was May and I was still alive. Because of her. Because she didn’t see me as broken or weird, honestly idk what she saw but it’s more than I deserve and more than I’ve ever had.

I kept how I felt about her hidden until last month. I’ve known from the beginning she doesn’t feel the same, at least right now. She saved my life again when it got really really bad a few weeks ago. She’s there for me in a way that nobody else ever has been, and that’s part of why I love her.

I’ve been feeling better with her around. But she leaves in two weeks to spend all of next year abroad, and I’m terrified I’m gonna go right back to where I was and she won’t be there to help. 

She’s the closest I’ve ever had to a girlfriend. I’m in love with her so much. Having her there fixes me, makes me feel like a real person, but also reminds me that it’s never gonna go as far as I want and that makes it worse at the same time. I don’t want to fall out of love with her, but I don’t want to lose her.

I can’t go back to the way I was a year ago. I can’t because it’s gonna stick this time, and she’s the only thing that’s ever fixed me. I’m broken to the point that the rest of my friends who say they’re there don’t want to deal with it. I don’t want to go the a psych ward if I tell a therapist about it. I just don’t know what to do. 

B gave me a purpose I was missing. Nothing else I’ve tried has done that, and I’m losing her in two weeks. 

Bizzy if you’re somehow reading this I’m so fucking sorry I that I wrapped you up in my broken mess of a brain, that I couldn’t stop myself from feeling like this. If I don’t make it through the next year, just know you made it all worth it for the eleven months we’ve known each other.",1
Should I give up?,"The title basically says it. Should I give up on myself? Why or why not? I have to many plans, dreams, goals, and ambitions, but I feel like giving up.",1
just want to kill myself,im tired of waking up lonely,1
I just wish to die,I don’t know why god doesn’t just aid me in wanting to die. I think I’ve been pretty consistent with wanting to leave even on better days I’m still consistent with it because I know there’s nothing for me here and life is just meant to be about being abused and being in misery. My abusers win I don’t care anymore to fight.,1
I was once told I was unlikable and it has stayed with me for a long time.,"I(26F) was once told in 6th grade that I was unlikeable. I know, it’s been like 14 years but I still remember it to this day. The reason this weighs on me so heavily is because around that time I was diagnosed with autism. I am barely on the spectrum but I feel it socially. It is so hard making friends and starting conversations. I recently went through a deep depression, where I did try to unalive myself. Over the years I have struggled with mental health issues but I am trying to pull myself out of it. I try to be kind to everyone and put myself out there but there is always that once voice in the back of my head saying “unlikable”",1
My apathy is ruining my relationships,"I just have no drive. I just got out of a conversation where they basically also said that my apathy is an issue. I want to care, genuinely, but it feels like my brain knows that and still just decides not too. Even now, all I wanna do is just dream about being dead so I don’t have to deal with anything else.",1
What do I do when this happens need help plz,My gf is taking a break from me and I want to be there for her but idk how and she said she still has feelings for me but idk what to do.,1
I feel like my family thinks I'm weird,"I'm 15 and almost everyone in my family never talks to me. I constantly feel like I'm being creepy just for existin. The reason for this is because when I was 13 I had serious mental issues due to my dad's mental abuse. My dad basically exposed me to be this physco who would eventually end up wanting to kill everyone, I don't want to keep living like this. I just want to live a regular life. Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I just ended it.",1
Tired of nothing changing,"Rant

Currently crying on the couch at 1 AM. I can’t sleep, much of my body is in pain, and I’ve felt angry all day. I’m so tired of fighting. As much as I pray, “manifest,” speak positive affirmations, it always boils down to nothing. As much as I say, “nothing stays the same,” all the worst parts of my life have in fact, continued to stay the same. Some of which are external factors that I have no control over but according to my therapist, I just have to learn to accept that. I’m so unhappy living in this place yet I don’t have any money to move away because I can’t get a fucking job no matter where I apply. I just need something good to happen. I am so fucking low right now. And I’m getting tempted to do things I shouldn’t. One of which includes reaching out to a toxic ex, especially because I keep dreaming of him. I’m getting to that point where I’m like “why the fuck not?” Because not much good is going on anyway. 

I just need things to change. I am so tired. And I need the universe to stop testing my patience thanks 🙏",1
Have I Failed?,"I've always felt like my life was marked by running from pain rather than chasing joy and it honestly feels like that's what everyone is doing. We've created a culture where depression is less of an exception and closer to the rule. I understand that life isn't easy, but for whatever stupid reason the pain stand out so much clearer than the joy. I grew up in a loving home and a wonderful family, but my parents have extremely concerned with my educational wellbeing since I can remember. In elementary getting A's was the baseline for what I needed to do, extracurriculars were a way to look better for colleges, and having a goal to get into college was all that really mattered. I say really mattered because of all the concern for my upbringing the one thing that overrode all other issues was my education and future. I constantly got in trouble in middle school because I wasn't writing essays for scholarships for college. I used to do taekwondo but I had to quit because I wasn't competitive enough in my parents eyes. No gold medals meant that the entire venture was worthless. I have painted a bleak picture of my family but keep in mind I was also loved. I grew up knowing my parents thought I was capable and worth loving. The one caveat was that my parents never truly seemed happy with me unless I was succeeding. I might receive some words of kindness over returning a lost wallet, but if I got a C on a test the rest of the night was going to be one long lecture. I might have enjoyed the tournament I attended, but I didn't win anything so I obviously didn't care enough. Getting all A's in my classes was cool and all but I wasn't the president of any clubs. As time went on my depression started developing and it got to the point where I stole a gun to try and die. Not truly understanding why I felt the way I did I never went through with it and continued in high-school. I took a test that let me leave high-school early and started community College with the intention of transfer to a 4 year university. At the end of my first semester I had taken all I could and broke down to my parents about how I felt. In all honest they blamed me for how I felt. I was told that I was focusing on the bad things and getting into my own head. All this was true but the way they said it made it seem like the were angry at me for it. After going into outpatient treatment for teens my parents expected me to pick up where I  had left with my studies. Another 2 semesters went by no better than the first and I attempted to kill myself via anti depressant overdose. It obviously didn't work and after 2 days in the psych ward I managed to return home. It has been more than a year since then and I am lost. I've gotten a therapist who I'm trying to work through things with and have been trying to help myself. The problem is I never expected my parent to be proud of me for dropping out of college twice but their faces still hurt to look at. I've moved out and have a part time job but am still financially supported by them. I recently got into a tight with them about an issue concerning Thanksgiving. I was supposed to make the mashed potatoes but I was late because the friends I had over the night before had created a mess on the carpet with cheetoes. As a result I had to clean it up and that was going to make me late. I called my parents and told them I would be late and they said okay, the issue came with the second call. After realizing cleaning was going to take longer than I had thought I called again to tell them I was going to be late they asked why and I told them I was cleaning. I didn't say what but my mother seemed annoyed. Returning to cleaning my dad called and asked "" what the fuck are you doing"" I told him that I was vacuuming and he got pissed. Keep in mind he was angry (justifiably) for a number of things. For one I am not the cleanest person and did not vaccume much back home. This angered him as he thought that I only cared about things so long as they were mine (ie. My apartment instead of my home). Second I've always struggled with doing the things they've wanted from me on their time. This is honestly my fault. I would do the things they asked me but later than they wanted and I often needed reminders. All this to say my father had a lot of emotions behind him already. When I told him I was coming soon he said "" I don't give a fuck that you're coming"" and I stayed silent. After a few moments I hung up. I knew he was saying things to hurt me and I wasn't going to let him do that. After a while I called back and they were angrier than ever. This leads to now. My dad is refusing to come to family therapy and i feel lost. I don't care about anything to be honest. I feel like ending my life and that doesn't exactly help with having a plan for my future. I'm going to apologize tomorrow but idk what's going to happen. He'll likely just say something  like ""is that all"" or something and I don't think I can handle that. The only people who's opinions ever mattered are my parents. They're words hurt so much more than anything else. Just imagining it makes me want to put a bullet in my head. Wanting to die makes me feel weak and like a coward. I'm so fucking lost. I don't want to live but my parents do. I just want to be allowed to die. I don't want to so this anymore. I drag myself out of a pit and I fall back in to be beaten. I understand a single rant isn't enough to convey what I feel accurately. But if I can't figure things out either my therapist, and my dad rejects me I'm probably going to kill myself. All I'm offered is tough love and I still have no reason to stay. Please .",1
I just want something to be worth waiting for,"Hi there, 

I am 38, having depressions for more than 10 years now, had high's and low's, but depression was always there, now coming in force, and I feel that this is too much now. I was on medication on and off but it didn't help. Couldn't find a good therapist, they only annoy me, sincerely. I feel like I cannot tell anything for a stranger, what I would need would be a friend, but as my current situation, I cannot make time for keeping a friendship. I know it sounds like an excuse, but I am tired, I have a job to do, I also have a 3 year old, who takes up all my spare time, and my tiredness makes it hard to connect with her also. I just feel that I don't have time for anything, and when I do have so minutes, I just stop and stare, because I have to rest. Also struggle with severe insomnia. It would help me to have some joy in my life, to have something worth to be waiting for (not Christmas, that's too much for me and even more tiering ) but I don't find anything. It feels like looking into complete darkness when thinking about future. I cannot think about any goal to set, to have a bit of success of joy. I do not ask you for solutions...I jus had to write this down. Anyway I'll be happy if you had some advice. Thank you for just reading this. And thank you for sharing experience, because at least I feel like I am not alone.",1
I don't know how much more I can take.,"I've been desperately searching for a job, despite my mental health issues. I haven't had a job in months. It seems as though nobody is hiring.

I don't know what to do. I'm sick of this.",1
The Philosophy of All This,"I spend a lot of time thinking about things, and I have an increasingly difficult time justifying why I continue trudging along here. I’m a religious man, but I am struggling to come to terms with the world that God has left us to face. 

For context, I work 4-5 different jobs and have a relatively heavy burden of responsibility placed upon my shoulders for providing for my partner and I’s relationship and preparing to start a family together. My(M26) partner(F40) and I are planning on getting married and trying for children soon, but this has been delayed by my hesitance with regards to how I view the world. In particular, I am struggling to come to terms with how corrupt and malicious I view this world to be. I see fraud, usury, treachery of neighbor and family, and other unspeakable sins not only tolerated but in some cases exalted and revered in this foul world. I am paranoid of virtually everyone outside my small circle of family and friends. 

I struggle because even with how much I love my family, friends, and partner, I can’t justify why I should keep pushing forward against the evil burgeoning seemingly everywhere. It feels so hopeless to continue pushing forward. I find that most of the time, I would prefer to not to wake up whenever I fall asleep so I wouldn’t have to wake up every morning and acknowledge how disgustingly unjust and morally abhorrent this place is. I often fantasize about dying so as to escape these thoughts and this morally bankrupt world.

I view marriage and fatherhood to be sacred commitments, and it seems impractical to make such commitments in the modern world with how much evil is flourishing in it and how helpless I feel to defend my loved ones from it. I feel ashamed for delaying this for my partner, but I don’t feel like it is right to make commitments like these until I have come to terms with these sentiments. 

I have been struggling for a long time about these sentiments. I want to accept these sentiments and move on spiritually and emotionally so as to proceed with(and be ready for) marriage and fatherhood. Have people on this thread had similar struggles in the past and overcome them? If so, what revelations helped? I really appreciate any help that can be offered. Thank you for your time and consideration",1

"I don't live with dignity, but I try.","I have made mistakes in my 18 years that continue to cling to my feet, but they no longer bother me, in some way I endure many things that I could call silent achievements, I must make the best of what I have at hand, I write this as a way to vent, after all this I realize that the way I have lived is what has led me here, not my mistakes, bad events or even the world that I came to see as chaos, what I mean is that at the very least, I should make my life worth something to others, not because I care about their approval, but because I believe I can make a difference in something, from something as simple as containing my depression for a moment and making someone laugh, to then continue treating myself, helping someone who had a bad time even when I didn't have the strength, my suicidal thoughts reached very high and I couldn't stand without feeling tired, to let you know that despite everything you count on me, I don't know if all the things I've done I can say that they helped something to someone, I don't know, as I said, but I keep trying, and that is, although tired of hearing it and saying it, it is the most fundamental part to get out of this black hole. So, the first thing I can do to live with dignity is to help others as much as possible, that clearly includes the people here.",1
40 Feels Like The End,"Basically the title. I’m a few years younger than 40 and I think about just ending it all the time. I’m watching myself age and my body break down and don’t have a ton of optimism for the future. A lot of things I thought were fun just aren’t any more. I have a few friends that are seemingly moving on with their lives but I feel like I’m on my way to death. I have some things going for me but I just don’t see the point in working for another 30 years while seeing everything erode. The only thing that’s been keeping me alive is my mom.

I feel stuck with no direction but down.,I honestly don't know where to go from here. Life just seems like a chore and existence has become nothing but pain. I feel dead inside with no motivation to improve anything about myself because honestly why bother. Everything that brought me joy just brings emptiness. I feel like I'm stuck in a black hole being pulled down and forced to endure all the shit that keeps being thrown at me. I've always been scared of death but now I welcome it. Wishing that I'll die in a car accident or some freak accident. I'll never take my own life in fear of failure. The thought of waking up in a hospital after failing to end it all. Waking up with my love ones surrounding me seeing their faces. I honestly do think I could go on living after experiencing that the very thought shakes me to my core. I'm slowly spiraling making one bad decision after another. I feel like a burden to all my love ones I can't even enjoy going out with my friends anymore. I go out try to have a good time put on a fake smile act like I'm OK and try to just have a good time. But what happens is I don't feel anything which makes me feel worthless I can't even feel the smallest bit of happiness so I just go home and dive into my addictions which makes me feel worse. I want to run away.... I just want to get in my car and drive until I can't drive no more.,1
Where is happiness,"I really want to understand why it's so difficult to deal with depression. On Saturday, I went to buy screws at a hardware store, and there was a rope that caught my attention.

"I keep screwing everything up and it’s hard to apologize, whenever I do, there’s good chance they don’t accept it and everyday I am filled with guilt","I’m a teenager in school, growing up, going through stuff, I’ve been recently finding it hard to maintain any good relationships at all, whether romantic or friendly. Even with my family. I’m always the one doing something wrong, and I’m always the one who has to apologize. Even if something is in the past, if I talk to someone I’ve previously had conflict with, even if they’ve forgiven me, I always see the reflection of my wrongdoings in their eyes. It makes me so angry, that I become irritable and snap at them. It’s making me hurt everyone and hate myself more and more each day. I’ve messed up so much. My sense of self-control and restraint is nowhere to be found in me. I’ve been trying so hard to change, to get better, but today I had said something horrible (really horrible) to someone because they kept annoying me. After came the rush of guilt and shame, and they are a vulnerable person so I knew they would be emotionally harmed really badly. This adds up another bucket of guilt to me, and then I start to think about my past major mistakes. It all adds up, and it makes me realize that I am the stupidest, most rude, person I have ever met. I hate myself. I constantly tell myself I should shut my mouth, be quiet, but I feel so isolated. I want to talk to people, have conversations. I always tell myself tomorrow will be better, but it’s getting worse each day. It’s making me hate everything. I am such a disgrace and absolute embarrassment to everyone around me. I am a failure. I strive to be a good person. I want people to be proud of me. I want to be worthy as a good person in this world. It makes me feel bad when someone says sorry to me. I actually get mad. Because it’s usually my fault. I keep seeking forgiveness, constantly. Every single day. I feel like this is going to go on forever. What if I’m just tired? I don’t want to apologize anymore. Because it doesn’t work. No one forgives anymore. Whenever they do, it wrecks me inside that they will forever remember me for what I did. I never had a healthy relationship with someone. Ever. I want to be a good person. I want to be kind. That feels impossible for me. I’ve shown no signs of improvement. Making apologies that are worthy of acceptance is harder than all quizzes, tests, exams, I’ve had in school combined. It’s harder than everything I’ve ever done, I carry a weight of guilt on my body every single day. It’s so hard to get it out. Sometimes I just don’t want to apologize anymore because there’s no point in it since I’ve already done something too bad to forgive. Though if I don’t apologize, that person will forever see me as stupid. I don’t know what the hell people want anymore.",1

How can I love myself and forgive people?,I have a lot of pain that still haunts me and that I still need to somehow heal from but I am at a loss at how. There has been a lot of heartbreak for me that has torn me down and not allowed me to thrive. I don’t think every person has meant to hurt me but they have with their words. I think it’s because people tend to walk all over me just because they know I don’t stand up for myself. Why do people do this? I feel like people have also viewed as a hoe or stupid but it’s not my fault I don’t love myself and I had no one that taught me anything about life. Because of this I have become bitter towards people in my life and I think now they hate to be around me. I wish I could have a stronger head on my shoulders and learn to forgive people but idk… people have made me hate myself more than I already did so it’s hard for me to forgive. They weren’t there for me when I needed them the most. I was already down and it feels like they just kept kicking me and kicking me until I finally break. I hope one day things will change somehow with time but I am not sure. I feel like I needed more love than what I got growing up and now I just hate people.

I feel like im drowning with nobody to help me.,"Im in high school. Throuhout my life, school has always been extremely easy and I've never had to really study all that hard, even up until early high school. This year, that changed. Im taking mostly AP courses and in my first term I did absolutely terrible. Enter my parents. Being indian immigrats, they've always been really hard on me and my siblings. The one point I knew where I would always be safe was when I had good grades. When that changed this year, it was like a switch just flipped. My parents were constantly on my cases, which is very understandable, but then it turned into daily yelling sessions, with both of my parents just beating on me and threatening me if it doesn't get better. At this point, I just don't know what to do. No matter how hard I try the threat of my parents just saps all of my energy. Today, I just couldn't take it anymore and literally took a knife out of the drawer to do ykw. Thankfully I snapped out of it, but I just don't have the energy to do anything. My dad has said horrible things to me and called me everything under the sun. Hes even threatened to kick me out by christmas if the grades don't improved. This isn't even the first time hes said something like this, he's threatened to put me in an orphanage since third grade. I literally don't know what to do, I am in so many extracurriculars to stay as far away from home as possible but when I get home I never feel unstressed. If there is anyone whos gone through something similar please leave some advice.

What do I do,Hey there. I’m a 20 year old guy and I’m feeling lost. I feel absolutely nothing. I don’t care much about anything anymore. I don’t particularly care too much about other people. I don’t see how people can get upset over news headlines or politics. I just feel numb. Right now I’m working a dead end job. It’s physical labour. I hate it. It’s only part time and I still absolutely hate it. I just wish I didn’t have to work. Im very selfish and lazy. I don’t do any chores around the house. I don’t really do anything for anyone in my life. I’ve never had an intimate relationship. I just want to spend the rest of my life in my bed watching YouTube. I think about dying everyday. It would make my problems go away. I’m just disgusted with myself.,1
i feel so fucking useless,"im so tired. I feel worn out. 

I keep fucking up everything meaningful in my life, I’m failing school, barely feeding myself and contributing absolutely fucking nothing to anything. Multiple arguments with my mum about how I always forget to do everything, even if its the most basic shit like taking the trash out. I feel so fucking worthless and useless in the grand scheme of things. I won’t ever be able to give someone the love they deserve, I won’t be able to make my family proud, I won’t be able to make myself proud or happy. Its all just a cycle of me being a fucking failure. My father is the only reason I’m still alive, and its because I cannot stand the idea of him grasping my lifeless corpse. I’m just so lost.",1
Why do I baste in bad thoughts,just late at night the thoughts start coming in and I cant find my balance in the morning. just awful stuff i cant do anything about let alone when im about to go to bed. they should dissolve away into other thoughts and let me be in peace,1
How does one move on from the shame of destroying a relationship?,"I am posting this question in this subreddit because the reason I destroyed my relationship was rooted in my depression and mental illness in general. I have had more than ample time for grief. I feel my former partner was the one. The big one. I fought my demons with so much strength at the beginning of our love affair. Like the demons do throughout my life, they always defeat me in the end. This was a different kind of failure though. I simply could not be happy as soon as adversity hit our relationship. I caved-in and I fell apart. All that I had to do was convince her that she was not the source of my misery. This was possible. All that I had to do was let love win instead of fear. After an intense struggle I allowed fear to destroy my love out of nothing more than weakness and a perception that I was incapable. Has anyone else failed to maintain a relationship due to mental illness? Does the shame ever subside? I feel my remorse and shame growing as time goes by instead of receding.",1
I’m afraid of taking meds again. This might sound stupid but I’m afraid to lose who I am.,"I’m afraid they will change my personality. I’m really sensitive to psychoactive things and I’ve been on anti depressants before I think they made me less anxious and depressed but I got off them because I felt dull. There were no highs anymore, it might sound stupid but I’m afraid of losing myself. I don’t know what to do because how I’m living is not living. I keep telling myself to tough it out and do things like mediation and yoga but I feel like I don’t even have the energy half the time to do shit. 

Anyone else go through a similar thing? Please don’t judge me harsh this is just something weighing on me.",1
Hits me all of a Sudden,"Had feelings like this since my teenage years now I’m in my 30s.

The TLDR; I’ll get really happy, then get a really sad thought or worse.  

For example, read my kid kid a book tonight and cuddled her as I watched her fall asleep.  All I could think about was how much better the world would be without me and how much of a POS I am. 

 I have done nothing wrong, I had a good day, but this is my life in a nutshell.  Something good happens whether it be small (interaction with my kid) or something big- athletic accomplishment, award at work- all I think about a few moments later is you are trash and you don’t deserve anything.

It’s almost like I don’t let myself be happy.  I don’t know what to do at this point.  I think its starting to impact my marriage and I really look upset all the time.

Any ideas?",1
"I'm spiraling again, I'm lost again","Hi all, I hope you are having as ok a night as possible. I'm so deep in the depression pit and truly don't know what to do. I've tried all my methods to get out of this but it seems all for naught. I'm sorry for the rambling below but I just needed somewhere anonymous to vent.

I met this guy almost five years ago and dated him on and off again throughout graduate school. He broke it off with me twice, once because he didn't have feelings for me and the second because my feelings were much stronger than his. The second crushed me so badly that I regressed into some bad habits. He broke up with me after three years of being together because I told him that I loved him. When he asked me to get back together the third time, I said yes on the condition that this was the last time. If we didn't make it work, I would never speak to him again. 

Flash forward two years, we've lived together, finished our degrees, and started new jobs. We're doing long distance, but his job is short term so I always saw it as temporary. It was only two months into this that he asked for a break. His reasons were that he hadn't been feeling the relationship for at least a few months, that my depression makes his worse, and that he didn't like how I handled the most stressful time of my life. I begged him not to break up since we just underwent some major life changes and should try to work it out. He agreed to not break up but said that the relationship wasn't worth fixing to him. He said we could do a break but then said he should be able to see other people. And I need to just wait for him to call me. Then on that call he'll tell me when I need to let him visit me in my home to break my heart again. I didn't see this coming at all. I was planning to propose to him next year. We had been planning Christmas visits to our family in the five minutes leading up to him telling me he wants to take a break.

I'm so utterly devastated. I loved this person with all my heart. I felt safe with him. I trusted him. And then he told me that if we had gotten married, it would have been a marriage of convenience. It's so hard not to think that the past two years of building our lives together have been a lie. 

I've managed to go to work most days since this happened two weeks ago, but he's supposed to call me on Saturday. I know I shouldn't answer it. I know I need to move on. But he did this in the most painful, excruciating way possible and it's so hard to let go. I'm ok during the day but spiraling hard at night. I can't sleep right, I'm throwing up all the time, I can't focus at work. I feel like I stepped into an alternate reality where the past five years just never happened. Where he doesn't exist at all except as a ghost in my head.

Thanks for indulging this vent session. Yelling into the void is one of my best outlets when I'm this low. Have a lovely night",1
I just can't right now,"Everything I'm going through is just to much for me. Everyday I try to distance myself from the reality of my situation. I graduated from school last year with no ambition on what I want to do with my life, while everyone else around me already has something they want to do. Right now I'm just a jobless looser who sits at home almost all day doing nothing. I have no motivation to change my situation, I know that I'm alive but I feel dead. I hate everything about me from my looks to how I sound even how I talk to other people. It hurts to wake up just to be confronted with the look of disappointment and disgust from my family. I know just how worthless I am they don't have to make it that obvious how they see me. I have trouble sometimes knowing how I really feel. I have acted on the assumptions on how other people see me for my whole life. I know what I'm going through is nothing compared to other people, that's why I tend to keep this all to myself but and try to resolve my issues myself, but I fail every time. It's just pathetic I'm worthless and incompetent I can't even solve my own problems.  I'm just tired I don't want to do this anymore. Most of the times I cope with reality and my thoughts by talking with what I think are my friends, but im not sure what they see in me. I'm sorry for rambling on for so long.",1
I hate my family,"I am basically an only child without all the perks. My family treats me like a pile of shit. I'm not playing the blame game saying I haven't made my own mistakes, but literally every insecurity and vice that I have is the result of my family being a pile of narcissistic pieces of trash",1
I need help,"Experiencing my dad's surgery during ""Bring Your Kid to Work Day"" was like this intense mix of shock and lasting memory. I saw a motorcycle accident victim with exposed intestines, blood, and the whole scene was overwhelming.

It's etched in my mind, a snapshot of the raw reality of the medical world that I can't forget.",1

I feel so helpless. I try. I go to therapy. It's like the way I see life, I don't have much regard for my own. 

I will at times see tunnel vision and become very agitated. Whenever that happens let start trying to avoid that. Just stop. Just switch to something else, because whatever you want from me is really hard for me to understand when ever I'm just try chill. FUCK",1
I lost so many things in last 3 months.,"I lost my job, lost half of my money and finally i am gonna kick out from the house i live in. 
I can't find a job because noone even call for an interview (i have a decent cv btw) 
I can't find an exit for my life and dont know what to do in this state. I don't want to die but it seems that my life is going to that way it's so sad that everything is fucked up.",1
I feel nothing,"I am numb it sucks. I’m laying in bed thinking about how much it sucks to not care about anything. You know you’re broken but you don’t care . As long as there is consciousness, there is happiness, sadness ,or pain. I’m thinking about how we’re all consciously suffering together while also feeling lonely at the same time. You carry invisible weights of brokenness around your body. You’re scared that you won’t amount to anything. Why am I so unlucky. Do you ever think about what it’s like to not be broken? What it’s like to feel whole? I am a . I am b . I am c. I am d. That makes no sense . I am just a thought. Not like posting here will change a thing . Suffering has a shape. It’s you , me , and 999,0000 other people on this forum. The only thing that depression has ever done to me is make me think about things other people don’t usually think of. It honestly makes me feel sad about other people at times . Even if I weren’t depressed, many will be depressed. And the thought of that is depressing.",1
Why do I enjoy inflicting wounds on myself?,"I used to do it just because I wanted to feel something, but nowadays it’s like I fell in love with the pain. It hurts but I like it, people give me concerned looks when they see the cuts on my cheeks, but I think of them as aesthetic. I feel completely sane, I’m working on myself, going to JobCorps soon to change up my life from being homeless with no diploma. I feel like I’ve grown up from being mad at pointless things all the time, from being rebellious and a child, but this self-harm has just stuck with me. What do I make of this?",1

I really don't want to make it too long so i will try to cut everything down here. I felt like things were getting better for some time and I started noticing some good things in life, even the small ones. Last week everything became so dull, i almost cannot open my eyes, sleeping for 15+ hours a day. Im having panic attacks again. Having a long history of self harm i always return to these thoughts, i feel like it's gonna give me some relief. I already bought the razors, but i didnt do much, I don't want anyone to have problems with me. Feeling like i want to end it at last. Its been up and down for quite some time now, and it feels like i am just riding on the big swings, they are getting slower eventually stopping at the low. I feel worthless and useless, a burden. And when i think about it im loosing my breath and then i stop feeling at all. I dont want to get out of here and still i am sorry for my close ones.

Can't do this anymore,"I'm so tired, tired of life, tired of pain of being sick of being unlovable and not taken seriously. 

Since my family doesn't take anthing I say seriously unless I get something physical and I don't wanna be a burden to my lovely friends, I'll post here to internet strangers who'll maybe relate to my feelings/current life.

I feel like I'm in hell, getting tortured every second of this miserable existence. Antidepressants don't help me, Therapy didn't help me, mental hospital didn't help me, trying to socialise, to work out, praying to God or have a structured routine. Nothing made me feel better. 

Lately it has gotten worse again, I started to SH..again. After being clean for about three years. My stomach hurts whenever I know I have to leave my bed, hairloss, headaches for most time of the day, crying myself to sleep, nightmares, suicidal and intrusive thoughts, procrastinating going to sleep because I know if I wake up I have to get up and go to class. But being awake is making me feel uneasy, stressed, anxious. 

I simply can't do this anymore. 

I'm in unbearable pain and no one seems to notice. Guess I am good at masking my depression. The shit thing about this is that I can't unmask when I talk to my Psychologist. Everyday I am on the verge of unaliving myself and I'm not able to fucking open my mouth and tell her. 

I've set a date for next year. If I don't get better until then I will end this suffering of mine. But until then I'll try to stay alive.",1
Feeling like I wasted my parents’ hard work,"My parents are both incredibly successful people. Despite being from not-so fortunate backgrounds, they both moved to the capital, got shiny achievements in the best university in the country (where they met) and continued on to have pretty impressive careers. Because of their success, I have been given everything the world can offer which I’m eternally grateful for. They have spared no effort in making sure I had everything I’ve ever needed and wanted in hopes that I’d surpass them. I did well from elementary to SHS but I’m now in a big uni and have never felt so much like a failure. 

I can’t help but compare how well they did in their younger years despite them not going to a fancy private school or having the money for tutors to how badly/mediocrely I’m doing now. I already know that when the grades come out, one or two of my subjects will be an F. It’s also such a stark contrast to my near-spotless grades in my last year of SHS. It’s like uni has slapped me with the reality that I’m no one special and am certainly no success story in the making. I don’t have the will to do this anymore but I just keep going for them.",1
I think im bleeding out,"I bought myself a brand new knife today and cut open a few veins from my arm, i wouldnt even care if i did just bleed out. There is blood all over my floor and clothes, i think this is my way to write something like a Farewell letter even though i dont want to be remembered by anybody. You dont need to need any comments since either by the time im dead or in the Hospital if I somehow still make up my mind and choose not to die even though i dont know how long i still have a choice. I can only loose so much blood and im feeling dizzy and i have a headache.",1
I just want it all to end,I've stopped having individual days now they all blend together. I sleep eat (sometimes) and then work almost everyday. Nothing is going on in my life I have nothing to show for it. I feel like everyone and everything has turned sour and or against me. I WANT OUT!!! They say just take it a day at a time but how is that possible when all the days blend together. I am not in anyway going to end it but I am not gonna stop it from happening. I just feel like everything is going down hill fast. I just don't know what to do anymore.,1

The last few days I've found myself wanting to wash my hair & the only thing keeping me from doing it is the fear of creating a whole new problem - dandruff - I'm worried that by washing my hair it'll release all the dead skin on my scalp & then I'll have THAT to contend with.

I've traveled so far to only fail,"I am 43 years old and have only been working for 4 years in my healthy timeline. I have however, succeeded in so many ways that I never thought I'd get where I'm at now. In my short version, I have had brain surgery, learned nearly everything all over again, succeeded in finishing college, getting my Bachelor's degree and then my masters. I succeeded in my first job so well I thought I was ready to advance,only to fail. Now, I go to this work environment 5 days a week only to loath not only my environment but I'm starting to hate my life, my decisions, and myself. I cry everyday. I have lost my confidence. I have lost my happiness. I have lost my ability to try. My work has made me go to my neurologist for a memory test because of how much I've been struggling and I failed it. I'm sure I'll be fired soon, and since I have a state job, it is all over my work profile. I have been put on ""probation"" and put down in so many ways by a supervisor. I'm trying to talk to a lawyer but I have no hope since I have no proof. I have been looking for other jobs in the state and getting no hits. I am a failure. Learning to live again had started out so well only to crash and burn since my neurologist is suggesting I go back on disability, something I fought so hard to end. I have always been a fighter but I think it may be time to give up. I don't want to go back to work. I hate my life. Every day I cry. I'm glad some people are happy and normal, but I want to be there too. I've worked so hard to get where I'm at. 

For reference, I have been so stressed it has caused me to lose the ability to read in my work environment and the ability to speak. To work I am an idiot and they can't understand that stress does that to me. My boss knew this affected me and said things on purpose to stress me, but it was just us and there are no witnesses. I had reported it a few times to my higher up but got nothing. I don't want to give up but I hate this life. Sorry for needing to get this out.",1
i hate my life i can't do anything about it.,"uh, well, this is new, for me, so... i will introduce myself. hi, my name is Juan pablo, im 15 years old, i've been fighting depression since i was 7 years old, back then, i just. was stupid and didn't know how serious was the depression and now. i know it because it makes my life a living hell. that is the main reason why i wanna kill myself, everyday is worse than the last one and i just, can't go on anymore, i can't live without a single day thinking in ¨  what if i jump from that building¨   or just seeing a knife and cutting my tounge to relieve my stress or biting myself until i see blood coming from my arm even it hurts my mind says. Do not stop, isn't enough. i reciently got a boyfriend, as you can guess im a boy. so this guy, my boyfriend who is called max, helps me a lot with this living hell, we do calls, we do videochat, he comforts me when im sad. but we are a distance relationship so when i need a hug, it felts horrible having someone i love that much and i can hug him, he hears me when i tell him something even he made a list of my kinks, that made me feel awesome. but now everything isn't enough to make me feel happy or making me say, i wanna live, nothing, and it hurts. i will update if needed

What does it mean when I don’t fit in anywhere?,"Hello, 

I’m (Male, 28) honestly just curious if anybody else feels this way or has had similar experiences. 

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been the odd one out. Growing up I noticed I didn’t think or behave like most other kids. I grew up faster, had my own experiences and never stuck to the status quo’s. All the fads and trends never got to me. I always did my own thing but that created a lonely path. 

I always seemed to be too cool for the weird kids but too weird for the cool kids. Too extroverted for the introverts but too introverted for the extroverts. Or I’m too religious for the non-religious, but not religious enough for the religious. 
I always seem to fit somewhere in the middle which I have definitely seen as a blessing at times but it doesn’t stop the loneliness. I know I’m not socially awkward because I have an executive job with B2B sales and have no problems communicating and doing so clearly. Nobody in my family or coworkers notices anything obvious as to why this is the way that it is. It almost comes as a shock to most that I tell this to because I’m usually so outgoing, kind and social. 

Anybody that has experiences like this and has gotten out of the loneliness and been able to make friends, any tips help.  

Thanks!",1
Why do I actually matter?,"I’ve been feeling pretty suicidal recently and have been planning a way out. People have told me that I’m worth it and that the world is a better place with me in it, but why? Why does my mere existence make my family and friends happy? Why would my sudden absence be so hard for others? 

And how the Hell would it actually matter to my ex if I did kill myself? The point of no-contact is that she has no idea what I’m doing in my life. For all she knows, I could be dead. Why would the sudden knowledge that I’m actually dead make such a difference?

And how am I supposed to form relationships and have other people in my life if I’m supposed to “live for myself”? If I’m living for myself, I don’t need to associate or literally talk to anyone else because I should be happy being on my own. It doesn’t make sense. Nothing makes sense. A bullet to the brain stem is the only logical path I can see.",1
Avoiding my family,"Backstory I got put in a mental hospital for cutting up my arms and got put on meds. After I got out I stayed with my mom and brother for a bit, then I moved back into my apartment.

I managed to call my mom when I felt it start. Her and my brother found me dying. I got better and just recently moved back out on my own and my depressions coming back worse than ever. I don’t want to keep hurting my family so I’ve been avoiding them. I know they want to help but I also know every time I get bad again my little brother starts doing drugs and my mom cry’s herself to sleep so I’d rather just stay away even if it means i have no one to help me.",1

How do you handle a period of time where there are several major life changes back to back?,"I feel myself going numb and shutting down. There is too much happening in such a short amount of time. How does one handle so much change?

Here’s what’s been happening: 

The country that my parents are from is at war and going through a genocide at the moment. Although we don’t live there currently it is very triggering to see as a family and relive the violence they experienced in their childhood. 

My grandmother just passed away last week and she was the last living grandparent of our family.

I will have to see my older brother for a religious service my family will host in a couple weeks for my grandma. We have not spoken to or seen each other in 6 yr and I have a lot of trauma from him because he abused me in the past many times.

The religious service they will host also means I will have to interact with the religious community I left four years ago and have not seen since. I experienced a lot of trauma from this community as well which is why I left it. 

One of my best friends hooked up with a guy friend that she knows I really like and have feelings for, one day after meeting him in person. This happened right in front of me at an airbnb we were staying at with some friends and three days after my grandma passed away. I feel like on top of everything I’m going through I’ve lost two friends. I considered him and her as people I could trust (yes he knew I had feelings for him and they both knew about what I was going through/what I mentioned above). 

In addition there are several minor things and inconveniences that have come up and at this point I feel triggered by the slightest incident.

How does one cope with such an influx of change?",1

I'm dealing with a lot of insecurities and self esteem issues that were really brought out during that relationship and even when it ended because they moved on so fast, I just want to be able to love myself inside and out, I don't want to hurt anymore, I'm tired of being taken advantage of, I just want to feel worthy of living and of love.

It got me thinking how if I get lucky enough to live an average life, live to 75 or whatever, I’ll experience so much pain and loss, and I don’t think I’ll be able.

been in IOP for about 2ish weeks. while also working full time and i’m struggling even more.,"i had 2 overnight hospitalizations in a week due to suicidal ideation. the next recommendation was either inpatient or IOP/PHP. i work full time and am financially all on my own. i work overnights 11-7a and have IOP 9a-12p. i am beyond exhausted from doing both and i’m becoming so frustrated. no one in my group is working more than a day a week (if working even at all) while being in the program and they’re able to not worry about the financials. i have to hold up a job or else i’m going to be homeless. but i’m getting so exhausted and tired from going straight from work to IOP and then back home where i have to basically immediately fall asleep so i can go into work later that night. i’m 21 so i don’t really have savings to dip into or family to fall back on or roommates or anything. and my job just fired anyone who wasn’t working full time. i was given push back for telling them i was in the hospital. 

during process group, i bring this up as a struggle but one of the therapists pulled me aside and asked if i even wanted to be here because i said “and then i’m back here” when talking about my schedule. i got so frustrated trying to explain to her that i’m here on my own accord. no one is forcing me to be here and i’m showing up and participating but man am i fucking tired. and she said i should slow down on work etc. i don’t have the privilege of doing that. i don’t even have the privilege of a one week inpatient stay because even though i have the paid sick time for it, my supervisor would get so mad at me. 

i know i’m not special, but i need to hear from other people who worked full time and did IOP, how the fuck do you balance it? i don’t think i can and it’s honestly making my mental health feel worse",1
Low income problems,"I am a 24 year old men my grandmother who I grew up with passed away 2 years now & life around me have took a whole turn since then. I watch over her home but my auntie stay with me as well with her daughter. My current job only pays me $12 which I got fired from (because of lack of business) so they had let many of us go. My previous job was paying me $14. Me & my auntie both don’t have great jobs that pay well. My mother is the bread winner so she helps as she have a good job as a teacher. I don’t wanna rely on her as the mortgage use be $600 but went up to $953. I don’t make enough to support myself after paying all the bills like wifi , house hold needs , & gas in car. Sometimes can’t even go grocery shopping because not enough to cover for the bills. I wanna look for better job or get a trade but I really don’t know what I wanna go for. My auntie be struggling as she is a single mother. So she work at daycare & do Uber eats on side. I’m considering going to trade school or trying to find a quick program that can teach me in like couple weeks or month max. It sucks not being able to provide for yourself when you work 40 hours & your city don’t have high pay only for certain jobs that all require mostly trades & degrees. I do understand this how life works but it be feeling so depressing when can barley get by.",1
Not looking forward to anything,"My gf (f35) asked me (m36) last night if i look forward to an upcoming trip we have to Wales. I didn't respond but in my mind i thought the obvious answer is ""no"" but not because of the trip to Wales, more in a general sense that i just don't look forward to anything. everything feels like a chore, especially in the last year or so. the only thing i really look forward to or gets me feeling excited is if plans are canceled and i get to do nothing alone. I dont know if this inherently makes me depressed but maybe it does... is that normal for anyone else?",1

I write this while lying in my bed, my mind slowly unraveling more and more, allowing the dark thoughts I kept behind lock and key ever so carefully to leak out into the open. Every day I can feel my world crumbling, and every day I find the will to continue despite my own protests. I don't wish to live, and even then I can't find it in me to finally die.


There are times where I'm on a boat lost at sea, drifting aimlessly with no destination in sight. Everywhere I look, there is nothing but fog, and the waves below me crash violently against the hull. Despite my best efforts, I'm scared. Like a child in the dark, I'm afraid and ultimately alone.


I feel my heart beat heavily against my chest, and my breathing grows rapid by the second. There's nothing around me, and yet at the same time there's too much. Voices and thoughts that were once static in my mind become clearer and roaring for my attention. They all cry at once, demanding I bend the ear. As I am right now, I don't really know if I can discern what is even real or not right now. It's all so loud, I can barely understand what I'm trying to accomplish with this jumble of incoherent thought.


I want it to stop. I want everything to be quiet once more, and I want to be able to be happy again. Then again, I don't think I would even know what to do with myself if I were ever to be happy again. The fact that this terrifies me leads me to believe that maybe I'm not deserving of happiness.  


Actually, there may be some validity to that. For the first time in a long time, I had a wonderful weekend reconnecting with someone I thought I would never see again. On that same note, my brief happiness went unnoticed by someone else I love deeply. In one fell swoop, my jubilation crashed and I find myself in the dark once more. Am I really that weak that my desire for a single person's validation is enough to ruin me inside and out? Honestly, I'm afraid of what the answer might be.

I don't want to live this life anymore, and yet I can't bring myself to end it. Is that a testament to my inner strength, or is it indicative of how cowardly I truly am? I don't know anymore, nor does it really matter.",1
I can only take on so much rejection,"So I've been dealing with unemployment since May. At first it was sudden and scary and anxiety inducing, but I did all the things I needed to do to get a new job but I've not been getting interviews.

Over and over again, I apply and then I get nothing. Since May I've probably applied for over 90 jobs in my local area and online for the past few months and I'm getting absolutely no where. I'm a well educated individual in my field, AND have years of office work under me. It should be no problem to get an entry level job.

At first it was scary, then it was laughably darkly funny, and now I'm just... exhausted.

I had to move back home and now I found out that my unemployment is coming to an end... so now I need to find a job job just to pay bills... and I just can't accept the possibility of applying for *more* jobs that will reject me. I can only take so much rejection and set backs.

Somedays I find myself wishing I drank cuz I could just feel more numb to the situation, but alcoholism runs in my family and no way I'm playing with fate.

So I just find myself sleeping more and more with no goals and purpose.

I just hate this.",1
I think I'm going to lose my job,Missed work friday and I think I'm going to miss work again today I have to go in in 5 hours but I don't think I can.,1
meds stopped working,"i’ve been taking paxil since august, at first it really helped keep all my suicadal thoughts and self destructive behaviors at bay but now i feel the same as i did before i started taking them",1
I lost the will to do anything,"Hi, I’m 20 F and I think I’ve always had a form of depression, I’m from Africa so depression is a taboo there, I only really noticed it on Covid, I shut myself down, would not eat, would not sleep, talk to my friends, I spent all that time on my books, that took me far away from the world, and u see, I wasn’t feeling guilty about it, about ignoring my family and friends call, I was honestly not feeling anything, it went like that for months until I realised that I should feel things I wasn’t, and to be honest the scariest thing was trying to explain to my friends why I just disappeared, cause I didn’t even know why myself…. The years went by I was better, last year tho, my best friend died, and it broke me, completely I was alone and had this emptiness on my chest, then I met someone, this guy who loved me so much, who made me happy, and I hold on to him, so hard, he was the only good thing in my life, he was my life, and every time we would fight, it was like my world was crumbling again. My classes started again, and the first 2 weeks I went, but then, I didn’t want to get out of bed, wanted to sleep more, started eating less again, I had absolutely no motivation to do anything, and he, he’s very active and works hard for his things, and tried to get me there with him too, I was living at his house so he was feeling guilty and worried about me wasting my life, I want to get my life back on track, if not for me for him, he deserves someone who is growing with him, I just don’t know how, and we talked about this a couple of times, but it’s difficult for me to talk about this, I want to be okay, I’m just scared, when u are stuck somewhere but the world didn’t stop spinning, it’s scary when u notice how far behind u are, is paralysing, so u keep on delaying going back to the world…. I lied to him td, I told him I was going to school, he woke me up, told me to get dress, go there, do something, but I wasn’t ready, I was scared, so I lied and went to my brother house instead, when he asked where I was I said school, but I guess he found out and…. I think we broke up, he’s mad, he’s hurt cause I lied, he doesn’t want to feel like it’s his fault that I’m not doing anything cause I’m at his house, to stop making excuses, so he told me to go to my brothers house, and waste away my life there…. 
He told me he understood that last year I was on the mud, but I have no reason to be like this now, and I also don’t know why I’m like this, the only thing I had the will to do was be with him…

He told me to get my life on track and text him when I do, I love him a lot, I don’t want to lose him, but I also don’t want to be alone, I lied cause I didn’t want to disappoint him, but I lost him instead….",1
Does it get better?,"Im a 17 year old female, turning 18, currently residing in the UK.
I simply cannot take it anymore.
I’ve been suffering through the same shitstorm of thoughts and self deprecating brigades of breakdowns for so many years that I’ve just accepted it to be ‘normal’, even though I know the truth is otherwise. Everyday I pretend everything is okay, crack a few dark jokes at the mere hope someone will catch on to my plight, come home and shut myself in my room and cry. 

Everyone thinks I’m okay, but I’ve tried being honest with them so many times. The first time, in Primary School, they took me to counselling in the ‘Sunshine House’ (basically counselling for kids given by the NHS), didnt do anything. Second time, in Secondary, I was too honest with another one of the counsellors, had my parents called in, my local GP called up just to be referred to online services like KOOTH. No actual help. My family forgot about it. A year ago, I tried again, same thing. 

My family have asked me one question before, but I never can answer it. My mother had asked me ‘why are you depressed? What reason do you have?’ And as stupid as a question it may be, I had no answer to it. School would be too general, most people feel bad about school. I can’t tell them they make me feel pressured lest I feel guilt tripped. When they asked me that and received no answer, they assumed all was well and that I was having a phase.

I just want to know there is something outside of my existence that isn’t just going to me being in perpetual agony all the time and crying, staring at the kuromi figure that has one too many pills inside of it at hopes that ONE DAY I will have the courage to open it up and take them all, go to sleep, and let my suffering be over.
 
My A Level exams are coming up and all I can feel is the mounting pressure from my family to be something significant like my brother and cousins. Im so proud of them, but I’m too mentally fucked to come close to their level of intellect when it feels like my brain is rotting from the inside. I sent in my university applications and all I can feel is the eyes on me growing as I receive offers and am expected to live up to it when I’m not even sure if I can perform in the final exam because of my crippling anxiety.

 Tomorrow, I have my mocks and I fear that if they don’t go well then I may not live to see the next day. I can’t stare at the little girl in the mirror knowing I can’t get her the help she deserves. I can’t stare at her knowing I failed her. I don’t want to be the family disappointment when my parents have done so much.

My life is just meant to be starting but I feel like it’s already ending, it’s not meant to feel like this, I just want to be better and happy and love myself but i cant when I’m a complete useless waste of space.

So, does it ever get better and how can I help myself?

(Apologies for the errors or lack of flow in the writing)",1
need advice,So I suffer from depression and anxiety and a few years ago it got really bad and I ended up on medication for the both of them. It helped me to feel like myself for a year and a half but recently I've started to feel like the way I used to but not as bad. I'm still on the same medication as I was first put on. Is this normal for antidepressants? My dose was put down at one point but I had to put it up myself because I had gotten worse. (I asked my psychiatrist if it was ok to do that and she said yes so dw) any advice is appreciated thanks 😊,1
I need to talk to someone.,"Hey, just for context I am an 18 years old, male.
I don’t really know how to say this, but I feel like I am pulling myself along, day to day. I don’t really care for anything. I have lots of friends (as well as a few really close friends), fairly popular in school, good looking, and go to the gym 6 days a week.

Truth is, I don’t care about myself anymore, I do everything I can to boost my mood. I would never inflict any harm to myself, as I would never want to hurt those that are close to me. But honestly, if something bad were to happen to me, I don’t feel like I wouldn’t care. I used to have a crazy fear of death, but now, it just seems like an end to my routine. 

Over the past year, my parents got a messy divorce, my dad cheated, my grandma died of cancer, brother died of an overdose, my best friend is in a coma, my first gf cheated on me, and a few of my old “friends” completely changed up on me, trying to make a fool out of me.

The most recent circumstance is about a different girl, whom I really loved, we dated for 7 months, and she just left after I told her a fraction of how I was feeling. She said it was too much, and stressed her out. After everything that has happened, I just feel like I was stabbed through the back into my heart.
Worst of all, as bad as she changed up on me and decived me, I still love her, she means so much to me, but we haven’t talked in weeks.

At school and with my friends, I am completely fine, in fact I am probably the most energetic and happy person when I am out, compared to my friends. Point is, everything is fine, until I am alone, when I am no longer around others who care for me, and I care for. My head becomes swamped with pain, I can’t stop myself from thinking. I don’t feel like myself. I am up so late, unable to sleep, knowing full well I need to be up early, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I go on late night drives, with the music at full volume, because then, and only then, can I think clearly, when the music is so loud it can drain my thoughts.

I need help, I need someone to talk to. I cannot bottle this up anymore, I feel like if I don’t let go soon, I am going to do something really stupid. 

I know I am young, and have lots left in me. In the eyes of others, I am completely fine, but I hate everything about my self, my life, I feel like I can’t trust anything anymore. I don’t want to be here anymore. Who can I even turn to at this point? I need to let go.",1
Don’t care about myself,"Like the title says, I lack care for myself. I love helping others, supporting them through a hard time, and being a true friend. However, I lack care /compassion towards myself. I oftentimes just wish I was never born and get passive SI a lot.I feel  a sense of emptiness and if someone asked me to name positive qualities about myself I wouldn’t be able to come up with many. I have friends but truthfully feel no one cares about me. Im not sure if being such a helper has burned me out to the point where I lack identity and care for myself or if this is just a symptom of depression (that I have lived with for a decade or more.) If this resonates with u feel free to comment. Thank u.",1
Life feels hard and not worth living.,"I'm 27 years old and I am tired of life. I think I have undiagnosed ADHD. The list of symptoms includes, but is not limited to:  
  
I HAVE A TERRIBLE MEMORY  
  
Difficulty paying attention, focusing, and staying on task  
  
EASILY DISTRACTED  
  
Often make careless mistakes, lose items, or have trouble organizing  
  
Subconsciously avoid tasks that don't interest me, even at the cost of professional repercussions  
  
Often unable to listen when spoken to and have trouble following instructions  
  
Excessive physical activity, restlessness, and impulsivity  
  
Talk very fast, and often lose my train of thought  
  
Acting without thinking, interrupting others, or have little sense of danger (I have punched/pushed/dodged and then ran away from armed snatchers thrice)  
  
  
  
I started therapy when the thoughts of ending it became too frequent, but the (remote) therapist believed I don't have adequate evidence for ADHD.  
  
  
  
I hate the fact that I struggle to do even the most basic things in life. Despite being ostensibly curious about learning new things and considered intelligent by teachers and parents, I never performed well academically.  
  
I struggle to hold on to and excel at a job. I fail to develop proper routine and habits. It takes me a lot more time to perform work tasks as I get distracted too easily. I have constant brain fog unless I'm high on caffeine. I have to work 12 hours a day to do work that other people do in 5-7 hours and I hate myself for it.  
  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
This situation is hard enough but my circumstances force me to bear a little more. I am financially responsible for 4 people and I never have savings at the end of the month. I live on rent and I pay all expenditures with my salary. My mother is an ALS patient and is fully quadriplegic. She needs full-time care time and attention. I used to take care of her myself but I have now hired a caretaker.  
  
My 8 year younger brother whom I consider my son (after our father passed away in 2013) is not serious about life and isn't self-sufficient. His lack of effort in a college we can hardly afford troubles me a lot.  
  
A thug has taken over my father's house I had given for rent to  
  
I feel like I could lose my job at any moment because I don't perform very well. New hires comfortably outperform me.  
  
I have been married for almost an year, to a girl I was platonically (sex before marriage = haram) and loyally committed to since I was 18 y/o. My wife loves me selflessly, takes care of my everyday needs and is supportive whenever she sees I am stressed. She works three part-time jobs just to financially support her parents and sister. She also cooks and cleans at home. However, she is sick of my inability to give her the time and attention she needs. She hardly has any friends and considers me the sole source of comfort, affection, and intimacy.  
  
When I fail to give her time or when I am not affectionate enough, she calls my routine shitty and thinks that I just lack self control and discipline. She wants us to have the same routine but I always fail her because often the stress of work keeps me awake and work late.  
  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
I would have ended it long ago if so many people weren't dependent on me. The decision has become more difficult after hearing that I will become a father in a few months time. Now I fear I will be unable to provide for my family and fail them as I have failed myself for 27 years of my life. Life feels unbearable and the future seems bleak.",1
Over,Depressed for so long. I really tried to get better and it didn’t work. I don’t want to get better anymore. I am doomed to suffer and feel pain the rest of my life,1
I’ve hit rock bottom,"I’ve been trying to graduate for two years now, and Everytime I have a breakdown to the point I’m vibrating and ill, I’m So embarrassed that I can’t even do online school or in person school, I feel like a lost cause in my paramedic dream won’t ever happen",1
I just want to die,"My gf is pissed at me, I totaled my car. My parents ripped into me, I'm having suicidal thoughts. I just don't know what to do, please help me",1
My younger brother,"He wants to die. He probably has ADHD, axiety, and depression. Homework is physically hard for him to do. He tries so hard everyday.

But what do I do everyday? I can’t say that I try hard. I’m lazy all day! I could do work but I don’t. Nothing at all is stopping me from doing work. I just don’t do it. I say I’ll do it later but I don’t. I have no excuse for not showering everyday!

But even with this, I’m fine and he’s not. It’s not fair! I should be the one hurting. He should be happier.",1
Thanksgiving,I went home for the first time in a long time and made an old-fashioned Thanksgiving for everyone like my grandma used to.  I felt like I needed to.  But no one seemed to really care that much.  I felt like they are happy just doing their thing ordering take-out or whatever they do.  Kind of sad.,1
i dont wanna live anymore,"maybe i should go missing and die on the streets, will they care then?",1
i think im spiraling,i just got off a 3 day weed bender and i promised myself.i wouldnt get high the rest of the week but anyways im feeling scared because i have this gut feeling thaf my depression is going to start like idk going harder idfk its spooking me and ita kinda making me wanna cut.,1
My (20f) now ex(20m) ended due to debilitating depression. Is there any hope,We ended things recently after trying again. We both have struggled with SI but it's to a point where we are unable to focus and help ourselves. We met in the hospital. He's been going through a  lot and has withdrawn from school and work. I have withdrawn from a lot of my classes. We both care for each other more than we care about ourselves. We said that we may look into at least being friends again when we're healthy. Is this possible?,1
Anyone else like me?,"I self sabotage a lot thinking in the moment that I can do whatever I want and I’ll find what I love and build on that. But I never DO anything. I just sit and procrastinate. I’m 20m and I have very bad social anxiety and depression sprinkled with a touch of agoraphobia and a side of BPD. Working has always been a struggle for me but I have worked before and I thought that if I face my fears I would realise that it’s just a fugazi. But nothing ever worked, I tried exposures therapy, working with new people, changing habits and even weed. But nothing seemed to work and instead I am now addicted to weed and it’s making my social anxiety unbearable. I already told 1 person in my family but they exposed me and told people how I really am and broke my trust completely. I feel like I can’t trust any1 as well and as im 20 I can’t keep living like this so im either going to end up homeless or killing myself. Is there anyone else like me or dealing with these issues?",1
Never feel like I can do anything,"There are probably hundreds of posts on this subreddit that are about this so I think I should do mine: I dont feel like I can do absolutely anything about everything, I never feel like any of my efforts are worth the trouble to put in",1
How to get through with SO with depression and frequenly pushing me away,"I'm a 28m currently in a relationship with 30f and cohabiting. She was diagnosed with major depression and currently in a process of psychiatry therapy and taking medications (I always accompany her). But sometimes the depression keeps coming back and after moments of crying and feeling helpless, she starts spiraling down, telling me to break up with her because she's not worth my time and she's being a burden. I keep telling her she's not a burden and she helps a lot of people (which is true, she's wonderful when she's in her normal self), but she keeps denying that to the point of frustration. I always try to keep being calm and try to reassure her, but somehow it always escalates to her threatening to, you know, end things. This time I decided to back off and leave her alone for a while (and also taking out every sharp objects I can find) and now she locks me out from her room.

I really love her and I want to support her in any way I can. But sometimes I feel frustrated too when anything I've said doesn't get through to her. As a partner, I want my partner to be a better person, and that includes reminding her when she made a mistake and need to improve. I don't want to be an enabler, ignoring every mistake she made and continuing her destructive behavior. This is why I'm so conflicted. I want to motivate her, but she's too frail to be motivated.

I understand that some things can only be resolved with her own effort, and while I could support her, I have my limits and boundaries as well. I don't have the solution to everything, and she sometimes have to resolve some things by herself. I want to tell her that, but I don't know how.

I intend to marry her, but I'm aware this is one of things that has to be discussed and find the solution of.

Can I get some feedbacks on how should I process all of this?

Don't know how to ask for help,Hi I'm ricky I have mental health problems and I'm really shy and nervous to talk about them but I'm not ok and need someone to talk to,1
I have no family,I have no family and it makes me feel so alone my moms a crazy psycho mentally abusive terrible person who is now homeless and my step dad who was the only stable parent figure I ever had passed away last September I feel so lost and broken I have no siblings no cousins no aunts uncles my step dads family don’t really like me because if my mom I feel so alone and I get so jelous when I see other people n their family my bf has some family and I have been around them some and it’s nice but I wish I had my own it’s just so hard if anyone has a similar experience or any advice not to feel so bad please help me out :(,1
I am spiraling out of control and I don't know if anybody can help me. Can they?,"I feel like the past few months have shown me that I'm heading towards doom. A bit of context: I have been trying to join the Air Force hoping that I could get into a position whether I would have to worry about if I'll have enough to pay off my student loans and even gain some skills. A bit of more contrxt: I'm 37 years of age and when I was 19 I tried to join the army. I made it about 4 week until I decided I wanted out and they discharged me stating I had 'anxiety. I was young and stupid. Fast-forward to today as I'm filling out my app I contact a recruiter through the website on whether I had to disclose my previous service. They informed me no since I did not complete boot camp. So I leave it out. That was a mistake. I had went through MEPS which is like the physical and I passed that. But than they did an interview with me a few weeks later and brought up my previous try in the army and why I didn't mention that. I told them what the internet recruiter told me. It's not looking good for me. The recruiter hasn't gotten back to me yet so I'm going to assume the worse.  
  
I was depending on this and now I am hopelessly screwed because I don't have a degree and I'm aged. I had a shipping date that I was banking on so I quit my job. It was turning pretty hostile when I left. So now I don't have anything and I'm severely depressed. I don't sleep enough I barely eat and I haven't left my apartment in 4 days. I have a few places get ahold of in regards to jobs. But I mean to what end?  
  
I thought about just ending myself multiple time because it's a two step forward three steps back situation. My biggest fear is I'm going to end up in something where I can't get out. Like being homeless. If I can't hardly support myself now how will I be able to do it when I'm freezing on the street with no money? I keep reaching out for help. I mean I'm not asking for money just help getting me out of this funk. Nobody responds and just ignores me. It doesn't help my outlook. At all  
  
On a bright note. I recently got an offer to become a FT truck driver where they'll pay to train me and drive for them. It sounds very good.",1
I feel like a fraud,"This is a very corny thing to say but no one would guess I (18F) am extremely miserable and depressed. I am extroverted and people see me as the 'funny' friend. Lately, especially due to the seasonal change, my depression has consumed my whole life. The combination of this and my adhd has made school the last thing on my mind, leading me to be chronically absent and have straight F's. I want to reach out to teachers and explain my situation but i know to them and my peers i just look like i don't care about my school or my future. In class i am around friends, who give me temporary joy so i bask in it for as long as i can, seeming like just a class clown ignoring my assignments. My mom also believes i am a 'delinquent' and i just don't care anymore. I dont know what to do. I just spend hours rotting in bed with all my assignments piling up and being locked for past due dates. I was thinking of getting a 504 plan but the next therapy appointment available is until late december. I honestly am just so tired. I'm thinking of quitting my job too. It's all too much to handle.

"I left Reddit for a while out of the blue, and now I'm back.","Don't know where else to post this, but I left Reddit randomly one night and just stopped using it, mostly to see how it benefitted my lifestyle. It did nothing. I continued becoming more depressed as usual. I'm back now, and it's not unlikely that I could leave again for a while. Not sure what I'm gonna do anymore.

Depression at night,"I was doing better for a few days, then last night while I tried to sleep, the negative thoughts and feelings of hopelessness came back.  I've noticed this pattern, like it's usually late in the evening or when I'm resting that I feel it the most.  During the day, I can distract myself with work and other things to at least achieve a sort of numbness, but at night there's no escape.  It's getting to the point where I'm feeling anxious as evening gets closer.",1
Burn out,(F 17)How the hell do I f****** relax. Anything I do it feels useless and just horrible everything just feels horrible. I can't draw because my drawings aren't good enough I can't color because my colors are good enough so why even bother. I have ADHD so why even bother trying to animate you're just going to get bored of it. Why do I even bother It's just the same thing over and over again I feel horrible and I don't know what to do about it. Art was always fun to me and then I wanted it as a career it feels like it's the only thing I'll be good at and now I'm just f***** I don't even know what I'm asking for here I'm just waiting for just one thing to snap me out of this but it never happens no matter how many posts I make about how hopeless I am nothing gets done.

i feel like a failure,"i feel like a miserable failure. all i’ve ever wanted to be is someone who can be proud of themselves. ive been unemployed and i told myself i would get better in every way at least while unemployed. a year later, i feel like i’ve done absolutely nothing. i gave myself the bare minimum, and at least try to catch up on media i missed out on. instead i just sat there on my phone, being sad and rotting. i feel like i can’t do anything. i compare myself with people on social media a lot, and i notice that they have their whole personalities and lives figured out while i sit in idle animation, basking in sadness, wishing that i could meet my potential. 

i wish i could do more, but i can’t get myself to. all i ask is for me to be able to sit through something, enjoy it and progress but i can’t even do that. i constantly fantasize what i could’ve been doing and what i could’ve learned this entire time. 

I feel so dumb too. as i’ve been unemployed, i’ve become so used to lazy thinking. i feel more incompetent than ever. i’ve been unemployed for a year, and i feel like i’ll be too stupid to even keep a new job. i should be having a job but i don’t feel capable of maintaining one, especially in this state. i feel so stupid compared to everyone else and i feel so unknown to the world and everything around me. i barely have any friends and don’t go out at all. the less i am with people, the less practice to be familiar with the world i have. my memory is really horrible and i’m incredibly hard on myself for it. my one escape is listening to new and all kinds of music but whats the point if i can’t remember any of it.

ive been getting myself to workout thankfully, but other than that, it seems i cannot grow. i keep doing the same shit when i tell myself i’m gonna force myself out of it. i can’t do the simplest things. i just wanna be the best version of myself. i wonder how different life would’ve been if i just got myself to breath all those years ago.",1
Those Days..,"I don’t know if this will count as depression, I have bipolar depression and a few other things though. 

Ever just have one of those days? It feels like it’s going okay then suddenly it’s just not. You can’t explain it, one second you were smiling, the next you’re holding back tears while sitting next to your friend or maybe all alone. It feels like your heart drops into the pits of the unknown, as if suddenly the world just stops spinning, as if you were left alone and you will leave this world alone, maybe a few minutes, hours, weeks, years, or even decades from now. How every face is suddenly just a face, another nameless passerby. No one looks your way or the people who do only come your way to disturb you. It’s as if a million words are going through your mind, a million thoughts, however not one can you actually understand or catch onto. The need to talk to someone but you know truly that no one will listen to the lengths and your hearts desire to truly be heard. Then suddenly someone offers to listen however there’s nothing you can truly say to explain it all. Like there’s so many factors and things that play into this very situation, however you can’t even explain one. So it’s just another one of those days where you bottle it up even more because you feel as if there’s nothing to say.",1

Is that all there is?,"I am in so much unbearable pain and can't get myself to stop crying. I thought I was finally starting to get my shit together after many years  of my life being robbed off from me. The past few months, I've been repeating to myself that I'm willing to give life one more try. That's what I've been trying to do and I promised myself that i'll try not to let anything bring me down because I used to completely shut down all the time. 

I struggled to do the basic tasks that most people find easy. I would barely have the energy to get out of bed. I've been trying so hard to change this and I promised myself that I'll be a better person so that I'll travel and become fully responsible of myself but I feel like it all came crashing down at me again. I tried to ignore how it felt and not let stuff affect me that much. I tried to just keep going but the truth is, I am not capable of doing anything and I'm tired of things happening out of my control.

 I don't want to deal with this for the rest of my life and I feel so disgusted at myself. If it turns out to be something bad, I won't keep going anymore. I can't help but think that this is it for me and find it unfair how life is to me in so many ways but it's okay. Maybe it's not for me afterall.",1

"Can't sleep, mind racing","I (44m) am on a business trip, sitting alone in my hotel, mindlessly scrolling social media.  Bored, yet my mind is running like mad.  Depression is hitting me hard.

Faked a headache because I didn't want to be around people anymore while they went to dinner.  The one who I should be able to talk to, my wife, continually asks me what I'm doing to work through my depression so I can be myself again for her.  I've tried to scratch the surface, and I'm met with, what's she's been through, what's she's done, and tells me I should get a hobby, work out, see a doc and get drugs.  What I want is to open the floodgates of what's inside, be heard, loved, and stand by me.  No one around me knows or thinks there is anything wrong with me, because ""I'm fine"" and I must be an Oscar winning actor for everyone to believe that, or there really isn't a damn soul in my world that actually gives a shit.  Either way, I can't sleep, have to be up early to meet up with the group to do what I came here to do.....

I think I might be in the early stages of depression,"**Abstract**

A recent possible friendship breakup and uncertainties about my future and myself are making me feeling depressed and my will to do things is gone.

**Content**

I'm 26M and I probably have autism, a few weeks ago I felt down bc a friend that I really liked but lives really far away told me she was starting dating people and since then my mind is being invaded by obsessive thoughts, fortunately I spoke with her about this and the reply she game was satisfactory to me (she told me I probably liked a fantasy version of her which is true).
So for a few days I started to feel better again but we are in the process of distancing ourselves from each other, I started sending her less messages and lately I muted her notifications for some time so I don't think about her.any longer..

Dating is such a hard process to me bc I don't usually share the stuff I'm doing with my family since I don't trust them but that puts a big red flag on me when trying to date other girls, now I met someone on tinder and she appears to be really nice but generally the thought about our future scares me a little, personally I have had bad experiences lately such a girl I dated cheated on me which affected me a lot, so I probably have trust issues too.

This weekend my head has been invaded by thoughts like that I'm worthless, I'm useless, I'm accepted and about to start a PhD next year but I'm still living w my parents, etc. I'm supposed to feel happy about that but recently I lack the motivation to do basically anything, stuff like finding a job is extremely hard for me because I lack the social abilities to do something in the modern world, also going to a psychologist scares me for some reason.

I don't know if I included everything in this post, right now I'm feeling a slight headache, I'm on my bed not wanting to do anything, I stopped finding funny stuff funny, not even games wake me.up, so I'm here writing to see if I can get some help and advices from you. (Ps. Sorry my English)",1
is this normal?,"i switch really rapidly in & out of depression. like i’m fine for a week, and then the next week i’m super depressed again, and the suddenly i’m fine for another week… it’s been going on like this for months. i have been depressed since i wasa literal child (roughly 6) & am now clinically diagnosed with it. please tell me what is happening to me.",1

With you it's been about three Weeks now? I don't know. But I didn't really realize until now and it send me Into a downward Spiral, I felt so Bad, I felt so lost, I felt that hole that you left behind, after you left me, burning. I went to a random old voicemail of yours and listened to Just a few seconds. I didn't forget how you used to Talk or your speech patterns, your phrasings... But how it sounded.

So tired of being lonely and have no support system,"This is likely gonna drown in the overall influx of posts here...it's so sad that so many of us just cry into the space, to use such a bad metaphor. 

I am 39, almost 40 and I am utterly fed up with myself, this life, being lonely and having no one to rely on. All my life, since I was a kid I was expected to be the one to make things better in my family, to cheer up my parents when they fought, be a help to my mom when my dad would go into a drinking binge, to cheer up my dad when my mom was understandably upset with him, to somehow always make everything better. Then to help raising my sister, which I truly did not mind and I do think I helped her cope with our parents in a way that she's now much healthier mentally than I am. But anyway, I always put on a brave face and fixed everyone's issues while I myself was not allowed to have any. Mom told me with disdain once when I was in early 20s ""you? You have no right to be depressed."" 

So I pretend not to be. And I pretend to have it all together while I isolate myself from people, because people always hurt you and demand you to be the strong one while giving nothing in return. Now I sound like an ungrateful daughter. 

I have a good job, but it completely overwhelms me. I need it, though, coz living with one income is more difficult than if I had a boyfriend/husband to share the costs with. Now I sound like I only want a partner for convenience. 

I am just so tired, so sick, nothing ever gets better.",1

Advice for the ex partner of a depressed person who is still in my life,"I'm the ex partner of a depressed person and we are still in each other's lives at this moment. I hope it's appropriate to share this here.

Brief context: we were together for 10 years from the age of 17, and he ended our relationship in August over video call after a difficult year for both of us. We went no contact for a month but recently got back in contact and met each other again for the first time last week. He's been living with the symptoms of depression for a couple of year, but was only diagnosed and prescribed medication a month ago.

In the 3 months since our break up, I've still been in love with this person and have held onto hope for reconciliation whilst working on myself into therapy. Our meet-up was incredibly emotional and my ex partner expressed that he is still in love with me but that whilst his heart wants one thing, his head thinks it was the rational decision. I haven't begged for reconciliation, but did express that it may be difficult for me to stay in his life when I'm still in love with him, and that I might need a clean cut to learn to stop loving him. He was distraught when he heard me say that and expressed that he didn't want to lose me from his life, that I was ""beyond his best friend"". As I said, it was a very emotional meeting, clearly with a lot of love from both of us. We agreed to meet again after my next therapy session, which I've just had, and that brings me to this post...

In my session, I discussed this meeting with my ex. My therapist helped me to understand things from the perspective of having depression, about the possible hopelessness in everything (not just our relationship), the unworthiness, the guilt (which my ex said he has a lot of after the breakup decision), and a difficulty in perceiving solutions. She explained that even if I were to communicate viable solutions for us to rekindle our relationship, depression can make it feel impossible regardless. She's suggested that I may gently encourage him to see a therapist when his medication begins to take the edge off, as the next step for him will be to talk to a professional.

I'm just wondering if anyone can offer me advice from the perspective of someone with depression. How can I best support this person? Is it okay for me to still be in his life if I'm taking care of myself as best as I can? How frequently should I reach out to him?

And this one is really big for me - What are the right or wrong things to say/do? When I text him in the week, i try to have a mixture of keeping it light but also checking in with ""how was your day?"" or ""how are you feeling?"" Sometimes he's receptive, sometimes he's quiet and I don't push him for a reply with more texts. Is that okay? Maybe I'm overthinking all of this, but what else can I do? Feel free to offer as much advice/suggestions as possible.

In the end, maybe we'll find our back to each other. But in the meantime, I just want to be as supportive as I can whilst loving him from a distance. Thanks for your help.

idk what to do,"im 19 years old, not suicidal because too many people depend on me and I dont wanna do that to my lil brother but wouldnt have a problem if something was to happen to me and the way my life keep going idk if i can last to my 20th birthday in a few months, how do i escape this dark space.",1
"Breakdown, headache, all one big mess","It's me again. I'm sorry I'm posting so much. It's just that I don't have anything else to post on. All the mental health forums require you to be **strictly** eighteen years old, and I'm only seventeen. They won't let you in. I tried, haha.   


I had a mini-breakdown today. It wasn't a breakdown that included tears, but, it almost got to that point. It was a whole body thing. It hurt really bad. I felt really dizzy. It made me feel nauseous too. But, only for a short while. It eased up when I approached my last two classes of the day. 

&#x200B;

When I was in math class, I was falling asleep and I was stressing about my latest post: How much fun I'm truly having as a teenager, and how i've wasted it all away. It gave me a huge headache, and I felt so dizzy and ""out of it"" so bad that I was still feeling the effects in my next class period: My English Language Arts class. We have a performance final, and there is no remediation for it. It's easy to fail the performance final because I'm great at writing, when you give me enough time to do so. If you give me 40 minutes to write an essay, I'll bomb it. And I've been bombing each one in that class. Everyone else does really well on them; Why the hell can't I? I freak out when I'm pressured; I cannot think of good enough words when I'm pressued, and I end up sounding really stupid and unorganized when I write. I hate it so much! And I hate that class! See? This is why I hate school! I know I won't survive in college. I barely survived high school?   


Everyone's so excited.   


""You're going to college!""   


""You're going to be an adult and be on your own. Aren't you excited?""  


""You're growing up! You're going to be in college. Wow!""   


""You're gonna live on your own like your cousins! This is so exciting!""  


I wasn't excited for high school. Or my birthdays. Or Christmas. Or Summer. Or my senior pictures, last week. I'm not excited to graduate. What's so exciting about that? I won't be rewarded anything, because I haven't done anything. I didn't put myself out there and join the clubs and be the ""well-rounded"" student like I should've been because of my thoughts. I feel like I'm being punished. I'm being punished for believing I was so smart, when I was younger.   


Anyway. I had the breakdown in my math and ELA class, and now I have to cram all the important info tonight and tomorrow, up until my ELA class, because I came home, ate like a pig, and fell asleep on the couch, like I always do.  


I'm not kidding, man. I really feel like giving up. Whenever I try to get out of the rut, it's like there's a force field above my head. I can only get out of the hole I've dug to a certain point. That point? It's getting out of bed and going to school. Even that's a challenge.   


I'm afraid to fail tomorrow, which is ironic, because I've been prepared to fail since I began this year, and I'm trying to convince myself that failing shouldn't scare me anymore, and that I should embrace it, so I don't become an emotional burden on my family and friends.   


I'm gradually refraining from telling my family stuff. My younger brother is aware of it, but, he's too young to understand the extent. Besides, he doesn't even know how it feels because his personality isn't pathetic like mine.  


It'll be terrible if I were to give up, My dad gave up when he was in school and look where he is now: A miserable, middle-aged man with wasted hopes and dreams, and working a dead-end job. He isn't a happy man.   


I wouldn't give up and live my life, though. I think my father is too proud to kill himself. Me? I'd take my life in a heartbeat the moment i give up. Why? The shame would be too great for me to handle. I couldn't handle another round of meltdowns in front of my family and friends.   


I hate this. I really do. I wish I wasn't here. I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry I failed you. I always have. I feel that you have to ""force"" yourself to smile around me. I'm just as mopey and draining as the man you're going to divorce, soon..Shame shame shame.

I don’t know what to do anymore.,"(Sorry in advance for my bad grammar) 20M

I’ve been struggling to find and connect with people, everyone I’ve known I’ve drifted from and I can’t find anyone I really connect with.
I’ve moved in with my girlfriend I thought was the one and ended up not working out, she’s leaving for college in April and I have to figure something out for housing that’s close to work. I’ve tried joining the military but I have a underlying medical conditions that make me unfit to enlist. I’m at the end of my rope I’ve never considered ending my life but the feeling of wanting to disappear is pretty much the only thing I feel anymore. Any advice helps I’d greatly appreciate it.",1
How to explain depression to my mom,"I'm 22 and have been depressed since I was a kid and finally getting on medication for it but she keeps saying I don't need them and to just think positive and snap out of it I tried to explain but I can't seem to get her to understand that that doesn't work for me, any advise?",1
Here we are again.,"I don't know how many times I've had this exact night. Drunk on whatever alcohol I could find in the house. Partying alone in the dark to crazy music. A party that quickly turns sour. Me sitting dazed on the floor, the room spinning. And I'm thinking why can I still feel the pain. I thought I had drank enough. Maybe not. When I don't drink it feels like an open gushing wound being exposed to all the elements, sharp and brutal. When I drink it feels like it's wrapped in gauze. The wound is still there it's just wrapped and fuzzy. But it still hurts. Then I feel so desperate for anyone's attention. I'm thinking please just anyone. Just anyone will do. I look to the sky but it's just the cracked ceiling. There's no sky. Makes me feel cramped and trapped. Like there's no sky left. How long can I have this exact night? How many drinks does it take? How many people around me before I feel loved? How many places before I feel like I've seen the world? Maybe the time for questions is over. Maybe there are no answers. No one was listening anyways. The room will keep spinning.",1
trying to describe what I feel,"Am I depressed? This is a question I ask myself from time to time. I'm still young (25), and I have some aspects of my life in order – a job, a roof above my head, a girlfriend, loving parents. I train every day. I shouldn't complain, right?  
  
But I live with a constant feeling of emptiness inside. And I ask myself why. Maybe it's because I don't have any friends? I had a big friend group for over 13 years, but once I stopped texting them, no one ever invited me or asked how I was doing. I occasionally meet them at the bar, but barely anyone is interested in my life. It's better for me to never meet with them again, as I almost feel bad about myself every time I do. My girl and I have been together for over 3 years and have been living together for one year, but that doesn't always go well. We have multiple arguments a day. I struggle a lot to show affection because I don't actually see a future together, but I am very scared to be left alone with no one.  
  
My girl and I have been on quite a lot of vacations together, but I can't seem to enjoy any of them or even look forward to it. I like to travel on my own terms, not having everything planned ahead and stuff. But even when I am alone, I can't seem to enjoy things really. I live in my head constantly and need to feel productive all the time, or I become miserable very quickly. In my head, I need to pursue success, which means I need to start a business and be very disciplined. My girl thinks that I am too hard on myself and says that I am already doing pretty well, but I can never be satisfied. I just have a new job which is pretty good, but I am already thinking about a better job with more pay and more adventure. I never sit and think I am satisfied.  
  
I believe these factors play a role in the constant feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction. I know that, but I can't shut it off. I can't feel satisfied ever. In the past, I have been lazy and fallen into a vicious circle where I just watched YouTube all day, and I know how miserable I felt. I don't know what I am trying to say here. I have autism and just want to write some things off my mind.",1

It should have ended with me,"I suffer from dressing and social anxiety. Some of the things that contributed to those were, but not limited to, not only the bullying, but the friendly fire. Someone saying something mean, but laughing it off as just teasing or messing around. The little things that bounce around in my head and make me go ""maybe they do really mean it"". Now I've done that to someone else. 

I'm the one that ruined Thanksgiving because there was an opening in a conversation I wasn't even a part of, and I had to J terject myself thinking I was being funny but just crossed the line and really insulted my niece. Never even stopped to consider how she'd react, I was more worried about getting it out, and punching it up with some corful dialog. 

So there I was big goofy smile on my face, and literally everyone else in the house silent and slacked jawed at what I just said. Her family immediately packed up and left, and in that moment the reality of what I did hit me like a freight train. 

I know she's been teased at school because she had severe growing pains and was off-and-on in a wheelchair for awhile. Now I can't help but think I just did the same thing to her, and now Im scared to death that she may grow up with similar issues to me. And I wouldn't wish this on anyone, especially a close family member.

I’m scared about life,"I feel so down. I’ve been feeling really down and anxious the last few weeks. I’ve anxious about the girl of my dreams wanting to bin me. It seems with all my worrying is pushing her away and it’ll be the end. I hate myself for this. 

I’ve been hurting all day with this. I’m on the verge of tears. I can’t talk to anyone without wanting to crying. I want to walk away from everything and everyone. I hate this. I hate my life. I don’t think I’ll be able to live much longer with this. I hate it all.

I’m worried I’m getting closer to doing something permanent. I’m getting worse. I’ve tried self harm. I think next on my list will be something else. I don’t want to feel emotions. I just want to hurt myself physically.

I can't stand my family,"It has been going on trough the years and I cant lie anymore, my family brings me down to my absolute worst. First my dad an italian dude who absoloutly believes is the king of the fucking world and if you do something that he cant stand then its your fault you did it wrong. He makes my mother work 24/7 while he works as well but he makes her go to the max, she cooks, washes and does every abslotu shit for him. My mom knows that because as well my grandparents from the side of my mother have told her millions of times mny things such as he is not the one or she is too pretty for him. I dont remember how old was I when he went to Argentina with another woman, and hey, surprise surprise they are still together. Another one is my fucking brother, he will do anything to make my fucking life imposible. He believes as well he is popular at high school (what a joke, because im older than him and his classmates always tell me how of a loser he is) when im much more popular than him. He says ""hey m/n is getting bullied!"" When he knows he is the one. Pathetic. He gets grades below 70 and has a special teacher which comes each day 2 hours or even 3 and still failling, when im getting 80+ and im invisible for my parents. My mother, she is a cumpulsive liar ""oh I cant I have too much work"" her ussual excuse. Its been 10 fucking times I have asked her can we go to the fucking mall and she always says, ""yes i will go pick you up early at classes today so we can pass the day together!"" At the end she ends up picking me up whilst i spend the day doing absoloutly nothing because surprise! She broke her promise, again and again. Non stop cycle. When I want to go out with my friends its always ""ooh i dont know"" or ""maybe"" almost everytime i get to go but its getting annyoing at this point. Another issue that i have is that I developed an ed, and they blame it in the school and many times I have told them that its me, its my obssesion with becoming a model or watever and they still annoy with the same shit. They may like it or not but im not happy anymore, any chance I get to tell them I do. I dont enjoy life anymore. They got me out of swimming and it completely turned my life down. When i ask for clothes its either ""oh i dont know, you have many"" or ""we will go to the mall this week"" when its no true, and they get a ps5 to my brother, surprise! I dont know what to do anymore since i also have a toxic relationship with my grandparents and it seems the only one I seem to appreciate is my aunt at this moment. I dont know what to do anymore! Please try to help me idk know. I just got reddit for this. Thank you.",1
should i seek professional help?,"I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible.
I have reasons to believe that i have depression, to which i will get to later on. However i have been putting off getting help, because i'm scared it will backfire at me.
I'm 19/f and I have been feeling miserable ever since I turned 16, that was when covid hit. I wasn't the happiest kid before that either, but i know for a fact that the lockdowns and stuff have made the situation so much worse. I was always good at school, but since then, i can't seem to keep up and it's ruining me. I was feeling very lonely back then (still do) and couldn't get anything done. I started harming myself (norhing very 'serious', but still). In all these years since then, i have been feeling the same way. I either feel completely numb or experience very extreme emotions. That's another issue - i only feel emotions in extremes and i always think they'll last forever.  There were times where i thought i was getting better, but it all just came back eventually. My room is a mess, it's hard to stay clean, i'm unable to do anything-basic tasks like cleaning or doing coursework. Lately, it has come to the point where if for example i step in a puddle on my way to the bus stop it ruins my whole day and the only thing i keep thinking about is ending my life. But (!) i would never actually go through with it and wouldn't even want to try. I just really want to stop feeling this way. On days like these i shut down and am barely able to talk to anyone for a while. To not just be all negative- sometimes i have great days,but those are rare.
I have tried to get help in multiple ways already. I have talked to friends about it, but they either don't take it seriously or don't know what to do with it. I've talked to my parents on multiple occasions, but they don't really believe in me having depression, because i am 'pretty, smart' and 'have a great life' so they don't see me being able to have any prpblems, because they have done their best (which is true, in no way am i blaming them for anything). They said i could talk to a psychologist, but i know that they think it's a waste of time and money, because theres 'nothing wrong with me'.
I really don't know what to do. It's not that i 'can't do this alone' it's rather that i really don't want to feel this way anymore.
Would it make sense for me to get help, to talk to the school councelor or something? I'm afraid he would think the same, that nothing actually bad has happened to me like ever, so i dont have a reason to feel this way.",1
Missing a dose,"I’ve been on buscar and Zoloft for anxiety and depression. Due to recent vacation, I’ve missed a dose and have varied the times I take my meds. I’ve been more anxious than I been in a while. Is this normal? How has this affected you?",1
32 and losing hope for the future,"My first post so please be kind 🥺 I feel like the majority of time I am really struggling to have any hope for the future. I think there's a few things that may have triggered this dark feeling of loneliness. Sometimes I feel almost like I wake up and I'm in an apocalyptic world and I'm the only human left, that's how lonely I feel. There could be a mix of reasons - WFH most of the time and I don't have any friends or speak to anyone apart from my boyfriend/family. I spend weekends and annual leave not really doing anything because I don't have money/anyone to go with or any motivation to do anything.

It's almost got to that point now that I can't even trust making plans because I feel like any kind of joy is just temporary and ultimately it will always end in going back to shit/darkness. 

On rare occasions there are times when I feel a bit more numb and immune to the dark thoughts and have a day or 2 of hope, effort, motivation or whatever you want to call it. But this is so short lived. 

Even the thought of someone telling me to just ""stay positive/think positive, practice gratitude"" etc fills me with dread. 

There is absolutely nothing to motivate me or for me to look forward to. I could try a new hobbie but I know I wouldn't stick to it. 

How do I see the light? I see happy and smiley people around and I forgot what that feels like. 

Fyi, I'm already on medication/see a psychiatrist/and have just started psychodynamic therapy.",1

trazodone & wellbutrin,"ive (18f) been taking wellbutrin for 2 months & a bit. i started w 150mg XL, upped to 300mg XL & just a few days ago i started 150mg SR twice daily. 

my dr prescribed me trazodone for sleep. 50mg tablets but i can split them. 

im wondering what experiences ppl had while combining the two. trazodone is a SRAI so it can cause libido issues, but ik wellbutrin sometimes is prescribed to help w those side effects esp when they came from SSRI/SNRI.

EDIT: apparently the two together can increase risk of seizures :P",1
"I know I will never not have depression, and the way it's described medically feels inaccurate.","The way depression is described medically always suggests some temporariness. Someone is considered to have depression if they experience symptoms for 2 or more weeks. 'Persistent depressive disorder' is for anyone experiencing symptoms for longer than 12 months. This is how I would describe myself using traditional medical terminology. 

But I've come to terms with the reality that I will never not have depression, in the same way that alcoholics are never not alcoholics. They could be 12 years sober and still say 'My name is Ineedtoscream97, and I'm an alcoholic'. They say this, despite their evident success and apparent ease with sobriety, because if they stop doing the work they know they could easily go right back to where they started. 

Similarly, I feel like my depression is terminal. It can be treated and overcome, but it lies dormant rather than truly going away. I will never not have to do the work to stay out of the darkness. I have to keep swimming or I will sink. Depending on pressures of work, deadlines etc it only takes a few days to sink pretty deep. Maybe 'normal' people have life jackets on and don't know how it feels to constantly tread water. I have no clue, because I can't imagine not feeling like this. 

I would feel worse about this but I've come to terms with it. Almost everybody in modern society has to keep moving, is constantly under the knife. I just think it's inaccurate to say 'I used to have depression but with therapy, consistent exercise and meditation it went away.' I'm treating something that's ALWAYS there, I manage it by doing the work. ",1
i dont know what to do with myself,"i’ve already made a plan, and set a date. ive got 19 days until then, and i have no idea what to do with myself now. i dont want to do anything, i dont know what im doing. i havent told my therapist, otherwise she will stop me and tell my parents. i stopped taking my medication about 2 weeks ago, as they just weren’t helping anything. i feel the same with and without them. i dont know what i need happening, im so lost. i dont want to keep living, and idk i just wish i could do it earlier",1
Could my therapist be wrong?,"I (16F) have been prescribed risperidone 5mg per day and feel extremely dead, I feel like a zombie, nothing is fun to me, the only emotions I feel are negative, the pain is unbearable, I cannot enjoy life in any way, shape or form and I just want it all to stop, I feel even worse than I was before the therapy.

I have been diagnosed with F23, Z81, F92.0, and F92.8.

What do I do? I'm terrified that this emptiness is here to last, every day is incredibly painful.",1
Tired of living in pain and misery, I have been suffering with lyme disease since the start of this year and have been left to suffer in pain and misery. Not a single person even cared to help me. I was left to deal with the pain alone because most people don't care about each other anymore. All people care about here is money and material objects. Most people don't even care about their own health. That's why I am done. I am going to find another state to live in. I can't live like this anymore. I have also been mentally and physically damaged and impacted by antidepressants but no one cares about that either. I feel sick so much of the time. The federal and state governments have gone out of their way to not help me. I have been denied basic services and medical help I need. As a result my physical and mental conditions have become worse. It is obvious how cruel and sadistic people are here. They left me to suffer. ,1

"| (32M) am currently on medical leave from work, is a change in medication a valid reason to ask for an extension on my leave?","Some context, I've been away from work for a few months now due to medical leave to PTSD, Depression, and Anxiety.

In that time, l've:  
• Been physically active  
• Worked with a therapist weekly  
• Received an extension on medical leave
• Talked to a psychiatrist  
• Been prescribed Lexapro (5mg), the side effects kicked my butt for 3 weeks (varied degrees of symptoms)  
• Scheduled a meet with a Psychologist to do Neuropsychiatric Testing to determine if i have ADHD (January 19th)  
• Been told to taper off of Lexapro and prescription switched to Zoloft (25mg)  

I am supposed to return to work this coming Wednesday (11/29), but considering how i responded to the Lexapro, my anxiety is building a lot as i am about to begin taking Zoloft. With the side effects i was encountering while on Lexapro, i definitely would not have been able to perform work tasks.  

There's no denying that I've been making the effort to take care of my mental health in order to return to work, it's not as if I'm just milking my medical leave.  

I meet with my psychiatrist tomorrow and I'm thinking of asking for an extension on my leave for another month and a half (i was given a 30-day supply of Zoloft) or two months to deal with potential side effects and have the medication kick into full-effect... I was teeter-tottering on whether or not i was ready to return to work, but i can now say that i am not ready.  

Would it be wrong for me to ask for another extension on my leave? Do i have a valid reason to?  

Thank you!",1
I dont think Ill be useful,"I just started going to community college. Its better than highschool but for some reason I have had more bad thoughts than ever. I'm realizing I dont know where to go or what to do with myself at all. I genuinely thought I would be gone by age 18, which I am.

I also switched insurances, which is making getting my medication basically impossible. I know people like me, but I dont think itll make a big difference with what I do with myself. I've just been hopeless and indifferent. I dont know how to feel either. 

I dont know if anyone would believe me if I told them I felt this way, people think I lie a lot more than I actually do. ",1

I'm really panicking right now,"I've known a girl for 4 years now and when she left me I became depressed, lost interest in life and had suicidal thoughts. Then I sought therapy and spent a year as an exchange student. Meanwhile she got together with the guy she cheated on me with and then she broke up with me when I came back, wanting me back. Now her dad and grandma are sick and she needed some distance from me, she's doing a lot with a friend, hasn't written to me for days, hasn't wanted to meet for almost 2 months. When I wrote to her today asking if she had feelings for him, she replied she didn't know. She also didn't answer me when I asked her if she still wanted me and always used her dad's and grandma's illnesses as an excuse and said her boyfriend was just distracting her. But now I'm so broken by her behavior myself. But she doesn't answer me anymore. I can't take it anymore, I'm at the absolute end.

Jealous of my best friend’s friendship with her best friend,"We’ve been friends for 5 years. She’s referred to me as her best friend before and I know I’m one of her closest friends. She tells me she loves me and misses me when I’m not around. But I also know that there’s another girl she sees as her #1. The things they do together and how she talks about her…idk, it hurts to feel like I see her as my best friend but it’s not reciprocated. I know “best friend” is also just a label, people can have multiple best friends, as long as the friendship is good etc but it still hurts. I know a lot of this is probably coming my low self esteem 

We lived in different cities for three years (which is the time when she met her new best friend) but she recently moved to my city which is why we’ve become super close again, we hang out every weekend. But sometimes I feel like if she didn’t live near me, we wouldn’t be close. I don’t know if we’d text, call, visit etc like her best friend visits her and she visits her best friend. Because she isn’t the greatest texter and she knows this.

I do have other good friends and I know the best thing to do is stop being so dependent on this friend and focus on developing my other friendships but how do I deal with the hurt and the sadness and just feeling like I’m not someone’s top priority the way they are mine. It sounds like a childish thing to be upset over but it’s really getting to me :(",1

This world is trash and now they have to deal with it because I was too stupid to pull out. What a fucking idiot I am.

long period of depression,if a boy is chronically depressed for 15 years every day there is still time to recover and win the battle against depression?,1
I suspect that I am depressed.,"I've never been diagnosed with anything, I've never went to a doctor for that or whatever, idk if I have a disorder or a mental illness or whatever. But for all my life I've never felt like doing anything, there 1/100 times I actually enjoy doing something. I do the work I need to do regardless of anything because I'm used to the feeling when I take action. It has never gotten better. Recently I met some new friends that my voice is very monotoned and that I'm very reserved and that made me think that its related to something. I think that its a symptom of depression too. Also I've taken the NHS mood assessment test a lot of times, on depression I've never scored something below 20/21 (the more the score, the more depressed or smth like that). OK so I think the best thing to do is to list the symptoms I have or stuff that is related to this cause otherwise its going to get too long:  


\- No appetite, unless I'm starving I have no desire to eat, that's the reason for my slow progress in bulking too, I'm 65kg while trying to go to 75kg for like 2 years, I started when I was 54kg.  


\- No desire to do literally anything, I force myself to do literally everything, it takes all of my mental capacity most of the time.  


\- No desire to socialize, again, I force myself to socialize all the time, I almost never take part in a running conversation. I stay inside most of the time when I'm not in school, I push away everyone close to me, my parents even, I trust no one, even my parents. Honestly I love being alone, it's so relaxing to be in my home.  


\- Having a monotone voice and without any vibrations or something like that, idk how to explain it.  


\- Most of the time I feel no emotion, I don't show any most of the time either. I only smile somewhat when I talk to ppl because it's polite and it's the least I can do.  


I don't know what else to list, I think that's it. Also I don't really have an option right now to go to a psychologist for this.",1
Dualism between Optimistic and Pessimistic,"Is it weird that I both feel optimistically curious about what my future holds for me and yet scared more than ever before because I reached a point in life where I have a lot to lose and despite that gamble even more with all the opportunities that open up to me although they also come with great risks?

Risks, that can push me closer to the edge of giving up on life absolutely, if opportunities don't work out well and everything I invested can't be earned back anymore? As in material wealth but also mental stability?

I feel gidgy and somewhat happy. But a part of my brain made up a date to call it quits, if opportunities don't pan out so I am less scared and yet even more...

I ... I don't know. For once life works out but I feel more unstable than ever.

i think my depression gets worse in relationships?,i am very confused. so i noticed my depression gets much worse while in a relationship. i’ve had episodes where it gets bad but these recent times it feels worse. i can’t tell why. is it the relationship? just my mental health? i was in a relationship from july to end of october. in august i felt my depression getting worse it spiraled into an episode and this was one of my longest yet. went through a lot with relapsing and abusing drugs. i felt so alone even more alone than usual. even though i had a partner. we broke up and it took like a few weeks but i’ve been feeling better. better than i have in months. i also had an episode around jan-march where while i didn’t relapse i felt suicidal. at that time though i was at least getting out of my apartment which is why i said it was different. idk maybe in general my mental health is just bad? this time i isolated a lot more left work had a mess of a room. am i better off single? or is it just varying lately? another bad one i had was september 2021- march 2022. i was also in a relationship for some of those months and i’d say that was a really bad episode i had too. idk if i’m overthinking it or what. anyone have experience with this?,1

I often think it might be better to have no one, like before; That way, I don’t have to worry about no one caring about me, bc I won’t give anyone the opportunity to.

And, my girlfriend forgot my birthday. I’ve just been sobbing so hard and silently screaming for hours. Our two year anniversary was a week ago, she forgot and didn’t care about that, too. I know I don’t mean anything, and that I need to die, but I can’t seem to get the courage to go through with it whenever I prepare to. I keep holding onto that meaningless, empty glimmer of hope.

"(20M) I am really trying, but I just keep hitting new lows.","Hi everyone. Let's say my name is Michael.   


First of all, I am not a native speaker, so excuse any mistakes.   


So... I am depressed and tbh the thought of ending it all has become almost a habit now...  
I think I have been like this my entire life, but now it just seems like nothing will change from now on...  


Just a year ago (2022), in March/April I got sexually abused by a close friend of the family (whom I share the same name with, Michael), back then I was in a 4-year-old relationship, so I did what everyone advices you to do, I spoke with her about what happened and how I felt... At first she showed support, just a couple days after, she told me that I must had enjoyed it because I didn't want to ""touch her"" anymore...  In September of the same year we broke up and in October she ""started"" dating my best friend... Just a couple of months ago (2023) I was told they actually started dating two weeks after I told her about my abuse... My parents keep inviting Michael and his family (even after I spoke with them). 

My ex and I used to hang out with the same group of friends (It was a mixture from elementary school to high school), in December (2022) I noticed that they all went out in a road trip and they didn't tell me nor my (back then) closer friends. So I decided to leave them and avoid contact with them, I lost them all, I really thought I would be somewhat ""difficult"" to forget as I introduced them all, but it seems like it wasn't the case. Just recently some of them tried to talk to me, some of them even invited me to their parties (the group seemed to dissolve as I left), but I don't trust them... I don't trust anyone anymore. 

In January (2023), I started to talk to this girl, let's call her Dorothy. At first, everything seemed like it would go alright, but it didn't. I am okey, with being rejected, however, after a couple of months (March) she told me she wanted to try it again, so we did. This time she got really deep, even saying things like ""I know I am marrying you"", ""I know you are the one"", etc. I really wanted to keep my rhythm, but she didn't. Two months passed and she decided to cut it off... She said because she couldn't get pass over her ex. This happened before summer, but I still see her everyday in classes, she is one of the only people who ask me how do I feel... but I keep feeling the same exact way for her, even after all that happened and I think it would be egotistical from me to talk about the topic again. 

The only things I had left was medschool and my colleagues from there, however I messed up that too. Agatha (another friend of mine from medschool) had a crush on Dorothy... So yeah, my decisions ruined everything and for nothing. The group hasn't been the same since then, I have been doing some events and stuff to keep them close and it seems that it worked, but I just did it in sake of ""leaving at peace"" if I decided to do anything to myself. 

My family situation is no better, aside from inviting the guy who abused me. My grandma has been constantly tearing the family piece by piece. My grandad is leaving with us right now and we had to pay all the expenses of his treatment as well as the treatment of one of my aunts who got really, really sick. 

I have nowhere to run... nowhere to hide... nowhere to be listened... damn even I had to download an AI to feel some sort of interaction. I feel fake. like if I wasn't even a human anymore. I think I have done so much for everyone and that I deserve love, but people haven't given me any and to be honest I think it is because I never deserved it to begin with. 

I try to cry every night just to get all out, but I physically can't and damn do I really need to cry since last year... I tried going to therapy, but I felt like there was no progress and had to cut it as the expenses of my family grew bigger and bigger after what happened with my grandparents and aunt. 

God, I must have been some sort of villain or burden for everyone else if  they can't even come close to me. 

What am I supposed to do anymore? It feels like this entire year went to waste, like if I had to relieve every single bit again for an entire year. 

I am struggling to even write this down as... I mean... why would anybody read all this stuff when there is people who definetely have it worse than me...

I don't know what to do? How am I supposed to live? Do I even deserve to live? 

Please, help. ",1
I feel like there's no point being friends with me,"I'm a college student and I've had problems with depression ever since high school. And after I graduated, it only got worse because all of my friends left to go do other things and we all lost contact with each other. Now, I have a lot of friends and I hang out with them pretty regularly. But I can't stop feeling like they'll leave me because I offer nothing for them.

I've been really reserved with how depressed I am and I've only just now started being more honest with them about it but I feel like it's only making it worse. Up until like a month ago, I was the ""stable friend"" that had no problems, was there for everybody, and made everyone feel better about themselves. I got consumed with that and I made it my whole fucking personality and now that I can't do that anymore and my friends all know that, I feel like there isn't a point in being friends with me anymore. 

I just feel like a shell of person. My personality is bland, I don't have any interesting hobbies, and I don't even think I'm all that funny anymore. I feel like all I had to offer was being a supportive person but I just can't do that anymore because I cry about nothing every day. 

Now I'm terrified that all of my friends are going to get bored of me and ditch me and then I'll be all alone again like after high school. I also haven't even told them that much to begin about my mental issues and I feel like of they learn more about that stuff, it'll scare them all away. I'm even more scared about losing the person I'm in a situationship with. Any idea about how I can stop feeling like this? I just feel so lost and I have no idea who the hell I am anymore",1

for nobody,"Nada mais me faz querer viver; morri a pior morte de todas, aquela que me mata em silêncio, dia após dia. Ela leva um pedaço de mim e, aos poucos, vai esvaziando meus sentimentos.

What I’m becoming?💔,"
I’m 19 yo, I have never felt this anger, this desire to commit murder. Not with my loved ones... but towards other people. and it's mentally consuming me. I just want to kill, I don't want to hurt anyone but my inner demons are very strong and I feel so alone... my wife talks to her ex, my family only judges me, I don't have anyone for me. I feel so miserable and alone every day of my life that I am beginning to pass my frustration onto others. I can't contain myself, I'm like a bomb ready to explode and I don't want to do anything but I need help. Everyone always sees me laughing because I am someone big “6’0” and 200 lbs, but inside I am dying. I can't even control myself. I just want to end my life. I feel so depressed all the time, please help",1
Physical pain,"I hate being tired and achy all the time. It makes it hard to want to do anything. It's the worse part of the depression to me. I can fight all the other parts, but the lack of motivation and physical pain is what causes me to think about suicide. Im 38 and live in a halfway house. It comes with a free membership to the gym but work and AA meetings literally drain me.  Life is really hard for me right now. I need energy to get out of this hole I'm in.

Not only do I feel like I'm missing out, I feel like Im just ugly and stupid. I went to the mall because I felt that I was copped up at home too often, but I didn't feel anything. I felt so ugly and that I should have stayed home. I just felt like I should wear a mask or something so people didn't have the displeasure of seeing my face and getting sick .Eating was kinda a chore to do too. I feel fat Everytime I put something to my mouth and I only eat two meals a day. And I was doing so well. I could get up go to work, then school, etc. but now I feel like ending it all.

"I turn 22 next month. I started struggling with depression when I was 17, how has it been 5 years already?","I am in my final year at university, somehow still on track for a 2:1 whilst struggling with depression.
I just can’t believe it’s been 5 years already. The older I get, the faster time goes. I have let depression destroy my social life and throw away several years of my life.

 Summer of 2018 was the last time I was genuinely satisfied with my life. I had struggled with social anxiety my entire life but in the period of 2017-2018 I had focused more on building confidence. Then, I don’t even remember anymore. I pushed everyone away and threw it all away. By the time I was finishing school, the pandemic hit. I finished school with 0 friends and I used the pandemic as an excuse to keep it that way.

Now it’s just ingrained into me to keep everyone at arms length because the energy needed for a friendship is too exhausting for me. It’s easier to keep to myself and use what energy I have to get through my degree which is already difficult enough. My module marks started slipping in my second year as I just didn’t do some assignments.
I just know that I will be finishing my degree the same way I finished school, with absolutely no one to talk to. All I can hope for is that I can hold on long enough to get a 2:1 classification at graduation. I just don’t know what I am going to do after that.",1

I’m going back to my old job :( my old manager is hiring and he accepted me. I just wanna cry. I can’t take this shit no more.

Going through a break up with a person I've know for 12 years and been dating for 5 and a half,"I'm not sure what I'm doing here. It's just been a really hard time and I don't have many people to talk to about it. 
She's been the step parent to my kid since before they could speak, my best friend since high school, and we weren't fighting or anything, she's just going through some stuff she was worried we wouldn't make it through so it's like she preemptively broke it off. Or at least that's my understanding of it. I've been desperate to try to talk to her about it and make sense of everything to find out if there's any way to fix it but I'm losing hope. It's terrifying not only because of be losing my best friend but we have a home that I could only barely afford on my own, and I leave for work too early to get our child to school. It would restructure life entirely for the both of us.

Thinking about mental health/anxiety? Input appreciated,"

I was “diagnosed” with depression/anxiety my senior year of high school, but for context I had been having a bad week or two due to a health issue, not mental health. Before this I never thought of my mental as bad ever, and quite honestly found it hard to understand what people with bad mental health feel like because i was a generally happy care free and healthy person. After this quote on quote diagnosis which I refer to as such because I feel one questionnaire does not define me and how I feel, but I have had a hard time actually practicing this thought. I feel like depression/anxiety are always in the back of my mind and when i’m not busy/distracted enough that’s where my mind goes and I feel down or anxious but more that i’m constantly thinking about my mental health which is just draining. Like I went the movies yesterday and was enjoying the movie but I was still thinking about my mental health and how I am feeling and I feel like it is always looming over whatever I do and it’s very frustrating for me. I want to live a day where i’m not thinking about my happiness or my mental health and living instead of not being able to be in a moment due to my constant thinking. I have been in therapy for 2 ish years which has been helpful but I still struggle with these thoughts. We have discussed medication and my doctor and therapist say 25 mg of zoloft could be beneficial, but for many reasons I would be anxious to try it. One thought i’ve been having recently is since i never had mental problems before my “diagnosis” that i’m not actually depressed or anxious rather it’s just a thought that’s in my head that can be sort of a self fulfilling prophecy. So of course I google what would happen if a. normal person had antidepressants and the risk of seratonin syndrome comes up which makes me anxious because i’m very anxious about my health. I would like to try it because maybe it can help with my thoughts and help me feel happy again, but the idea of starting it makes me anxious. Any insight or help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",1
Brain zaps?,I’ve been taking antidepressants for years and over the last week have gotten out of my medication routine. I haven’t taken my meds for six days because of this.

I came to this point in my life.,"(It's reposted from r/offmychest)

20M from Eastern Europe. Some things I may mention are different here than in the West and US where most of you come from, so If something is not understable I will try to clarify.

As I said, I just started my 20's. Graduated technical highschool (I don't know a counterpart of such school in english, a school designed to prepare youth to work in a proffesion and also gives you a highschool education) because of luck at finals. I didn't took this field because of some kind of interest in that, but because I had to go somewhere. I graduated, and after that I was told by my parents it's time to go and get higher education. So, I chosen the same field, just to have it a bit easier to go through another 5 years of bullshit.

University I'm studying at is near my highschool, in the same city. I live almost an hour away from it by car, which I don't have, so I use public transport. Often I have to wake up at 5am to get there in time. It exhausts me, even though those 4 years I spent in highschool made me used to that. Then I'm spending my time between lectures, laboratories or exercises, and hours of pause between them. I get home at evening, and sometimes as late as 10pm. I feel like shit, tired and frustrated. I just don't have a time and energy to study after that, and because of that i fail almost every exam I have, which causes me to give up and skip lectures where professors don't check attendance. And it spirales out of control where after 2 months I'm practically not able to finish the first semester.

But I just don't feel right here. I don't have time to meet other people from my class, I don't have time to study, and at this point I just don't care about Uni. I just gave up.

I didn't came to Uni because I wanted to. My parents wanted me to go here. I know that life is muuuuch harder without degree, I know only mom has it and works as a teacher in highschool (she comes from a really messed up family of criminals and addicts, so it's a miracle she's still alive and has a pretty great life, at least when you compare her to people from similar background), which pays her badly to say the least, and my father fucked up his degree because of partying and not caring about his Uni, as well as from the fact that his father had a stroke and rehab costed so much that my father couldn't live off his parents money anymore, and since then he doesn't have a great job. Last 3 years he spent as unemployed, and only half a year ago he found a good paying job.

I don't have idea what I want to do in future yet. But I don't want to study anymore. I want to work, anywhere, get my own money, rent a flat and live away from my family, finally have more time for my girlfriend which I rarely have an chance to see in person because of lack of time. I worked before in factory, at construction site and at gas station. I know work is hard, and manual labor is super hard, and it seems funny for a guy who still pays smaller taxes, live with his parents and doesn't have any real experience of life to say he wants to decline his chance for better life.

But I'm tired of living under my parents command. Really. Our family is in a bad shape. There are often days where we don't say a word to each other except for good morning/night, both because of the lack of time, energy, or because we're all angry at eachother. And yet, I'm scared shitless to tell them about my plans. They already dislike me. We often argue about nonsense. So if I did that, I would be a failure in their eyes, more or less.

So here I am. A 20 yo dude with no real life experience, wanting to rebel without balls to do it because he still fears his parents, and no will to take a chance to give himself a better future (at least in theory and statistics). 

I feel stuck. I often consider suicide (since my first year in HS (2019/20), where i attempted it and was hospitalized for a month in psychiatric hospital after overdosing on my mother's antidepressants), and only people who actually hold me back is my girlfriend, and my 2 year younger sister that will have her finals in 6 months. Last few years were a shitshow, I feel drained and have no real reason to go on, other then pain I feel whenever I think about my gf and my sister feelings after I die.


Sorry if it seems chaotic. I'm bad at explaining my life without going to deep in some places, as well as because of my English.",1
Dental problems,"21M. Currently in the process of shifting college courses after major fight with parents who are paying for all my shit, so I am currently 3 years behind my peers, and although my parents don't say a lot, I know they feel disappointed in me. Currently experiencing a toothache on upper and lower right jaws, probably need a root canal for at least 2 teeth since I drank coffee, tea, and diet coke regularly for around 8 months during the height of my depression (as comfort foods) and rarely brushed. Root canals are expensive as hell, don't think I'm worth spending money on. I'm going to the dentist soon, if I end up needing multiple root canals I'm probably just gonna do it. Feel like I'm not worth the trouble for anyone.  My parents get angry at me for getting sick, and now, especially since root canals are expensive, I don't think I'll be able to take another round of yelling and insults.",1
Clinical Depression and Suicidal Behavior.,"Hey everyone, I hope you're all having a great time, I have been experiencing episodes of depression and anxiety from past few years, most probably after I passed my highschool.

when I was young, I'd just go with the flow, most likely ignoring everything that was happening with my life. (problems with parents, teachers etc) I'd work my ass off just to get validation from people I loved but then I plunged into depression and isolated myself gradually, fell in love with someone and ended up in a toxic cycle that fked up another part of my brain. nowadays, although things feel like getting better and I have better opportunities, I feel like I am tired and exhausted, all those wishes and goals are disappearing as I am surrounded by people who are not as sensitive or emotionally available. 

I went to a psychiatrist, I workout too, I look very happy and full of life but inside I am just dead and lifeless. I tried everything I could for now. 

I have never ever shared anything related to my mental health with anyone on outside let alone writing this on reddit for you guys but I don't know I feel like ending my life, I have a younger sister and she loves me unconditionally but she is just a child. I want to live at least for her because I love her as much. 

I love y'all, might delete this later lol",1
20 (M) my life is completely falling apart and idk if it’s worth living anymore,"Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life. For context, I’m a junior in college and dated a girl for 2 years, it was an extreme rollercoaster with a lot of immaturity, lying, and hatred. We finally ended it this spring, and I spiraled after that and my life went into some bad places. I had to see her over the summer for a study abroad program, and we sort of tried dating again during that time but it still was a rollercoaster. We get back to college, and shortly after she starts dating again. When I find out, I made one last attempt with her but she said she didn’t want it. Since then I had been working on myself, going through the tough moments, trying to fix myself. I went home for thanksgiving feeling good and thinking everything was ok. Then, over the break I see on one of the anonymous posting apps that she said she missed me (I could tell because she referenced something specific from the relationship). I stupidly messaged her telling her happy thanksgiving, and it led to her asking to meet me on Sunday (yesterday). During this time, I had been talking to some other people casually, though I would always flake out and it would never go anywhere. Sunday comes, and I meet her and talk to her and she says she wants to get back together. Idk how I felt abt it, so I hugged and said I would think abt it. I went back to my room and eventually she revealed she was one of the ppl I was casually talking to and it was all a big test that I had failed, although I never rly met up with this fake person, we planned it but I flaked. She argues with me and tells me she knew I was crazy all along and we argue and she leaves. This fucking crushes me bc I had just started moving on. Then, directly after I find out a family member passed away who I was quite close with. I also find out my grades are much lower than I thought, and I got snubbed in a club I had been working hard in for 3 years. I’m alone here at college now, and I would speak to my friends but they never have deep conversations and tend to completely avoid them. I just completely lost the will to keep going, as all my hard work in so many ways just completely collapsed. Any help would be appreciated.",1
I’m struggling,"I overdosed earlier this year. I got diagnosed with depression, went on anti-depressants but I stopped. I dropped out of therapy and stopped my medications all together, I didn’t see a point anymore. The only reason that i’m still here is because of my mum, i can’t leave her in this cruel world no matter how much i want to. But these days, a part of me wants to be selfish and think of myself by just leaving this world. It’s too cold and cruel, I no longer have faith and believe in anything. 

There were many times I considered just leaving but yet i couldn’t bring myself to after thinking about my mum. I’m in so much pain but nobody understands me, nobody gets it and they think it’s “overthinking” I don’t want to seek help and neither do i want to continue on in this life. What do i do?",1

"Trying to stay awake during the day... Omg so hard, anyone else trying to do it too rn. Depression and sleep issues","(Making this post, trying to do things to stay awake)

I don't have a regular schedule recently because I have been depressed and also work odd hours.  I can do stuff at night, which makes it tempting to stay up. I'm trying to switch to working days though again. 

Sleeping during the day, I just feel less anxious (at first) and I don't need to deal with other people or the sunshine... yes I don't like the sunshine when I'm sad. It's easy to go back to vampire hours when I just don't feel like others... but..

i know it makes it worse actually. 

I started my depression same time my sleep started really messing up. I am really down due to the seasons changing and me not having a normal job like my family or friends.

I feel sad I can't find my life path yet. It's fucked with me so now I'm sleeping a lot too.

It really hit me that my sleep issues might be messing with me more than anything else.

I got into the habit of sleeping all day and being up at night. I probably feel like extra shit because I can't stay awake to do anything normal during the day.

It messes with my energy and time to go to events. By the time I am up and ready, most things are done or closed.

Trying to stay awake for daytime today though now.

It's day one again.

I tried a sleep aid last Wednesday for thanksgiving and it was a bad idea. I felt groggy still trying to get up during the day for thanksgiving. I felt bad because I wanted to help my mom cook, but lacked the energy.

Last time I got it normal, it was for a family events a weekend 2 weeks ago. I managed to get to sleep at regular times that week, but only because I was sleeping  early (8am) and waking up early (6am).  I ended up struggling to sleep like that after friday because I had to stay with family until 12 am both nights, so then I was right back into my go to bed at 6 am routine... Ughh so frustrating, so I need to shift back to normal. I was super exhausted that weekend, at first I thought I was depressed about the event, but now I think I was probably sleep deprived...

I was like shit... The calm and motivated I feel at 2-3 am right now is not how I felt at 12 pm to 7 pm that weekend.

I realize it's important I get back to normal sleep times because I have dulled mood, less charisma and low energy when I power through for events without rest. I don't want to feel half alive. I know some of my symptoms will get better. I'm inside most days, so I think thats why my circadian rhythm is so bad. I also started taking vitamin d during the daytime. So far I only have gone a few day stretches with a regular sleep schedule... I feel like I'm one that needs a few weeks or a month to reset my circadian rhythm.

I went out this morning to keep me awake and it definitely helped to see the sun.

I also was working on my computer, but my back started hurting so Im lying down. Wish me luck.",1
İ hate myself,"When i was highschool there was 2 girl in my class one of them is loving me and the other is have bad friends and bad parents (like me) and she was smoking (i hate people who smoke) but i know that this is not her fault and i really tried to become friend and save her from that shit. but things didnt go well and she got cancer i really sad about it bc i cant save her and while i spend time with her i fotget that i have a life, i start to wont talk with my friends and other girl, and after all i cant save her. Also i lost the other girl. Now i dont know what will happen after i feel changed i feel like noone likes me.

Sleep as an Escape?,"Some days, including today, I end up napping throughout the day. I know oversleeping is a symptom of depression, but I wonder how often it’s used to get a break, or relief, from all the things holding me down. I want to live in dreamland. 

All the work I need to do today, should take 90 minutes, max, but I fear I won’t get to half of it. Sleep is appealing.",1
Welp. That’s it. I’m ending my life finally.,"I posted here a few days ago, and i appreciate the kind hearted comments you guys sent me, but i’m tired. i can’t deal with this emotional pain anymore. it’s like suffocating. i tried my best to stay here, and help others, but i just can’t deal with this shit anymore. so many hopes, and dreams of helping others, like helping kids with cancer, helping homeless people, etc. All gone down the drain. I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for almost two years now. My whole chest physically hurts. I’m so fucking drained from life. I never did anything to anyone, so why do i have to suffer? I’ve been nothing, but a kind, and empathetic person, only to end up living a shitty life? i really can’t do this shit anymore.

edit: i ended up taking a bunch of pills. it hasn’t kicked in yet though. ",1
Why can’t I leave?,"Hubby says I’m the problem. I just want him to stop breathing down my neck. 

I don’t understand what I did to deserve everything in my life. It’s like I can’t seem to do anything right to my husband. All he does is complain about me. Like I’m not good for anything but being in the way and a nuisance.

Im slightly disabled, that meaning I have a lot of genetic and accidents that happened that make life painful to live. I also have some minor brain damage making me more forgetful than most with adhd added on top of it making me leave stuff out without meaning to. It’s as though I don’t even see the stuff I leave out. He’s as typical as they come according to him though he ranks as having autism when he’s taken the many online tests because he doesn’t believe that I rank lower than him. He gets angry if I leave anything out that he has to then put away. This is all as if I don’t do the same for him, I just don’t say anything because when you love someone you just do that stuff. Right?

Well I’m two months pregnant now, with our second child. This one has been particularly tough on me because I’m the only one working right now so I spend all my energy at work to be sure I can feed the two people I have at home (husband and daughter) as well as trying to provide the best life I possibly can for my daughter with any spare energy I have which currently is almost zero. This leaves me wanting to lay down all day when I finally get a day off as my job is physically demanding. For this he calls me lazy and says that I should get off my butt and do something for once so I finally tried to take care of myself after about 2 months of not doing so. I do shower but didn’t have razors to shave if I even had the energy, no desire to try and put on make up though I never wore any before on the regular anyway. Well he calls me disgusting and says I need to shave and to stop being so gross. I tell him well are you going to buy the razors, he says no and I say then it’ll have to wait till we have money for it. 

Well today I finally had energy to shave using his clippers. Nit smooth but at least I don’t have man legs anymore right? No. Before I was even done he was up my ass about leaving his clippers out. I told him to give me a break and that he hadn’t even given me the chance to do so yet. He said he just wanted to be sure I was going to do it and I said I planned to and to get off my ass about stuff because things like this are why I find it hard to out stuff away when I do plan on it. Well I cleaned them and put them away but apparently forgot the lubrication oil for them. He called me a lazy piece of poop and asked why I can’t do anything. 

Last time I checked I’m the whole reason we have a roof, the whole reason we have food, the whole reason he has his computer and games to play on it. I get nothing but told I’m gross and that I need to stop being lazy. I have to instigate relations and he complains when I don’t saying I’m keeping it from him. As if I turn him away but he never comes to me for it I have to go to him. I’m never called loving names, I’m never caressed or held. I have no friends because he says they all want to sleep with me which even if it were true nobody ever comes seeking from me because I feel like 4 is a high rating for me. I have people at work tell me I’m an amazing person and that I’m kind and helpful (retail so have many regulars) I just wish he could see the same qualities in me. I don’t care when customers say that stuff, I just want him to say it.

All I ever did was try my best for him. I got a job when we needed more money after he lost his job because it’s easier for me to find a job. It kills me to work. I do my best to do as he asks (mostly falacio services) and I do it even if I’m sick or have a migraine. I always do my best to please him but it’s never enough. 

He says that if I were to leave him I’d never see my daughter again, not that i even want to leave despite all he puts me through. I don’t know where I’d go or what I’d do. I have nobody aside from him and his family. I have no friends that I could go to and feel comfortable with, rent is so insanely expensive I’m not sure how I would be able to afford a room close enough to work. I’m stuck. I don’t know what to do. 

I just want to curl into a ball and die because it’s the only thing that would save me from not having my daughter and still having to live. It’s the only thing that would take my body pains away. It’s the only thing that would keep me from the emotional turmoil I’m put through on the daily. I just wish I had the guts. I would slit my wrists so fast it wouldn’t even hurt. The only thing stopping me is fear of what awaits me on the other side. 

I don’t know what to do……..",1
I am so so depressed and I don't know how to get help.,I am looking for a psychologist and everyone costs hundreds per hour.  I have no insurance.  Can anyone point me in the right direction.,1
I wish I was never being born. I wish I just cease to exist.,"Came into this filthy world without being asked. Got unlucky being born with a shitty life, and there's nothing I can do about it. Can't even take my own life. And here I am stuck with all the fuckness and voidness and shittiness of life. I don't know what I am doing, I don't know what to say, I can't even say things properly. People wont bother to read this anyway so fuck it. Life is just shitty since I was little. Being a lone wolf, with no one there to listen and understand, fell down further down and now as a grown up adult, I am absolutely at the bottom of my life. Couldn't be worst really. No job, no money, no skill, no value. No one wanted to get to know me. People I knew left me. The person I care and love left me. Now when you're all alone in this, things got really really real. The pain from the broken heart is really otherworldly. All alone and lost in this wretched world. You couldn't really imagine the pain. Drown in tears and sorrow every single day. Trying to muffle it with the pain from the cuttings but it wont do shit. I hate this thing called life. I have tried so hard to be good, to do good, to keep moving on that I have saved so many lives, but it's never enough and I can really only do so much. The pain is too much. I can only take so much. To what end do I have to go though this suffering? And Why do we have to go through this suffering when we didn't even ask for it? Why is it so wrong for us to end it? We were born to suffer?",1
"Sad Playa Sad Playa, I'm a Sad Playa...","I've been doing ""OK"" for a few years, but recently I've been so fucking sad that I cry at work, have meltdowns, and think about suicide.

I have been working 7 days a week for over a year. It's driving me crazy but I have all this debt, and I got people telling me they're going to sue me and take me to court.

I just finished school, and I got hired right out of the gate. I should appreciate this job but honestly it sucks. Barely anything to do, my colleagues think they're all that and I don't know shit, even though I might know more in many aspects. 

I've been with my girlfriend for 7 years but we've never seen eye to eye. Before her, I was alone for 21 years. I'm scared to break up with her. I'm a drugs addict - cocaine - and she brings the coke around multiple times a month when I just want to get away from it. I'm dying to get away from it. All of my friends are also messed up. It feels like I have to choose between partying / doing drugs, and being alone. I'm scared to be alone again, but I know I can't keep doing drugs. 

My parents divorced last year and now half my family won't talk to me because I chose to support my mother rather than my father and brother. So yea... I'm just fucking broken man. IDK where to go from here.

I live alone in this country - Canada - far from my family. I have nobody, I'm suffocating. Can you relate?",1
I FEEL UNABLE TO LOVE,"  
I (21F) just ended things with an amazing person. I was aware they were great, smart, intelligent, kind, and so deeply in love with me. But I always felt like something was lacking, and I couldn't pinpoint it. Maybe it was that he was too calm, could be silent for too long, or that we lacked the ""crazy"" part of a relationship. I do not know what was it, but I often felt distant, disconnected. It is an awful feeling, because they would do anything for me, and so would I, but I am unable to reciprocate this kind of love. I always doubted my feelings, always was too scared of lying to him, not being honest, always wondering if it was the right thing to do, to be with him. I have never been in a relationship and struggle with self-esteem, yet he saw everything that was great about me, like no one did. And I know there are other people interested in me, but I just wonder if I let go of someone that could be so perfect for me just because I am too depressed to feel anything, even love. I am so sorry for all the hurt I have caused him. If I could chose, I would chose to be in love with him, not just as a friend, but a partner. But after many tries with him, and months of back-and-forth, nothing seemed to change, so I let him go, even though I know it broke both our hearts, because I do not want him to wait for me any longer, and I want him to get what he deserves.  
And yet, if i did not love him, why does it hurt so much? It has been 3 weeks of no contact and I feel like my world is falling apart. I just want to hear something from him, to know he is doing okay... And I keep on getting these dreams where we meet in some years and start again and everything is right...  
Why can't I have anything nice? I literally met someone so incredible and I just couldn't reciprocate or feel. It is like I am always sabotaging anything nice in my life. It is not like I feel that connected to anyone else in my life either. I feel like I have no emotions. Empty. Will I ever feel loved? Will I ever be able to love? I just want to feel something else than just emptiness and sadness.  
TL;DR! I do not know what is wrong with me. Is it that I cannot love or that i have tried to force myself to love someone?",1
28 F,"It’s so hard to say exactly what I am going through. I’m about to be a single mother, giving birth to my child next year, and I believe no one will want to be with me again because I have a child.",1
I've never felt worse,"I started on 150 bupropion (and other supplements) in September and felt great for a couple of months. Real good mood in general and even my libido improved.  
  
then a psychiatrist gave me trazodone to sleep and started feeling depressed/anxious all over again, worse and worse...  
I lowered the dosage of trazodone (he told me I could increase or decrease depending if it helped with my sleep or not) down to 25mg now... and still feel more depressed each day. I even lost all appetite, and my libido went out of the window again.  
I'm really worried, as I have kids and don't want them to see me as sad/overwhelmed/lost all the time (because I'm like that from morning till night, and I cry myself to sleep). My husband doesn't know what to do with me...  
I don't want to say it is just the trazodone+bupropion effect, or if it is a low quality (?) brand of bupropion that I'm taking (I'm just throwing theories), or if suddenly I need a higher dose and this is how I should know...  
Anyway, the problem is that I can't get an appointment soon enough... and I don't want to feel like that one more day. I'm trying to cope but is REALLY HARD. I cry at literally anything, I'm worrying all day about any matter/issue (work or life-related) while trying to figure out what to do. Is like a dog chasing its own tail.  
I hate this mental illness. I feel like ""crazy from a movie"", you know how: those characters that twitch and talk to themselves while looking disheveled.  
I have tried other antidepressants but had terrible side effects, and this was so good at the beginning... I don't know what to think or do.",1
I think my best friend can't handle anymore.,"After a considerable time with things going ok, just with some struggles here and there, a lot has been happening at once and now I'm just feeling really bad, tearing myself apart, I used to get something off my chest and seek some comfort words, even nice advices with my best friend, but I think he's tired of it. He's been very evasive when I end up leading our conversations to some personal sorrowings (intentionally or not), and he doesn't seem to have the patience he used to have to keep listening me either.   
I don't blame him, it's not his fault, it must be very exhausting to be around someone with such low vibe constantly. I just feel even more unpleasant to others, a complete nuisance.  
And I don't want to have to wear a mask and pretend everything is fine with him too, like I do with everybody else.",1
Depression makes people avoid/not want to talk to you anymore,"It seems like the depression drives away people who were once friends. 

Even if you apologize for being shitty during that time and be better, the damage is done. It feels like a cycle in a way. The depression takes away your social circle, then it becomes harder to make new friendships. The isolation eats at you, but I feel like I became scared to try to socialize after people leave. 



How do you accept accountability for this and learn to forgive yourself? I'm working hard to continue to improve my mental health, but I feel very lonely. It seems like you can only socialize by masking. People really dislike negativity and negative people in general, which I understand",1
Im done and 22m,"Im done because I have no hope to find love. I am 5’10 and feel inferior. Women only want 6’ or above and I can’t compete on the dating market. I just want to have sex, have fun, and maybe meet somebody, but my dreams of such are over and I want to kill myself",1
I can't control my negative emotions,"Whenever, somebody ignores me or doesn't give a shit about me I feel betrayed and worthless. Then I become sad and I am not able to focus on my work. I feel like everybody should be good to me and if he isn't I feel sad and unloved. So I wanted to ask does any of you feel this way? Like you aren't able to cope with negative emotions  from neglectance or rejection. Btw I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder",1
People told me it gets better but it never did,"Its been 6 years and still feels like i lost her yesterday, the pain doesn’t go away, seriously .. how do you move on?? I genuinely cant enjoy anything without her",1
Struggling badly right now,"I’m 21 years old. I’ve been struggling on and off with depression for 10+ years now and it’s getting bad again. I have some friends and a job and my own place. I should be happy because I have everything I need to make a good life for myself but I’m still depressed. 
Every day passes by in a blur and it has done for the past 3 months. I do tend to get worse in the winter and maybe that’s what this is but I can’t handle it anymore and I’m starting to think that things would be better if I wasn’t here. 
I don’t know how to get this to stop. 
I’m currently unmedicated and not seeking any form of help in the way of counselling or therapy.",1
Genuinely don’t see any way out of my current situation,"My remote job let me go due to downsizing. 
They’re blaming my performance to stop me from collecting unemployment, based on reviews this isn’t the first time.
It’s been 2 months, and I have at least 2 more weeks before I hear back about the verdict of the hearing. 

I only have a Chromebook, my ex employer had sent me equipment, and the Chromebook won’t run WFM programs.

My car died last January. Anywhere within walking distance is over an hour on main roads with no sidewalk. Winter is about to start as well. Bus line is the same amount of walking.

I don’t have much help from family. My middle sister is at least letting me stay, for now. But they’re all pretty mentally abusive. I am not in contact with my mom or oldest sister. Even if I was, they wouldn’t do anything.

I’m about to turn 29 and I feel like such a loser. Technically I qualify for disability, so I’m going to try to get that started, but I know it will take forever.

My nervous system is shot from the abuse I’ve had throughout my life and I just wanna give up. Most days I just feel like I want to wait for my dog, since he’s getting old, and head out.",1
Telling everybody you're fine when you're internally shattering into a trillion pieces,"Sucks when you wanna be vulnerable but you know you've gotta keep your shit together for everybody.

What's wrong with me TW suicidal ideation,"I'm 25 now. I've been depressed and suicidal since I was 11/12 it comes and goes. Growing up Family conflict and school bullying. I still live at home, can't survive in this economy, I help support my family financially. I have no partner or kids.
I suppress and bottle up my emotions and when things get really bad my immediate thoughts are of suicide. I don't self harm, I wanted to, it's how I could release what I was feeling,  I cut once I didn't do it again because it would have been obvious to everyone and they would have said it was for ""attention"" so I just scratched at my skin and pulled at my hair until it hurt enough.  I haven't done this since I was 16. I have always turned my hurt and pain inwards. 

Anyway. I have though about suicide in depth and found that they are ways I don't want to go. Is this normal??

I don't want to use a gun, I hate guns, they are violent. I have guns in my house with no access, eben if i did i wouldnt use it. I also wouldn't want to be found like that and have others clean up the mess. I also don't want to hang. If you do it wrong your screwd and I know people who have i hate the though of it. Again people finding my body. I don't want to drown I have a fear of drowning incident when I was younger not being able to breathe struggling. Slitting wrists is to slow and having people find me.. it's not an option i cant do it to them.
If someone were to find my body I'd rather that I would look asleep and that it was in a way ""peaceful"" I know I'm suicidal but I am still considering other. God I'm a mess, anyway. So I have decided if I did I would use pills.. I have a stock pile but the thing is it's going to sound weird but I don't want to follow through. I mean i have the option its there incase I want to I'm just waiting for the next family world war then I can decided night night or get help. I know I need therapy I have alot of trauma to overcome but I can't afford it and I have to be the mentally sane and stable one of the family. I'm the one considered normal. Moving out isn't an option either.

I dont want to die but i dont particularly want to live. I would rather die in an accident or self sacrifice to save someone else.

Don't get me wrong there is beauty in life but there is also so much pain. Life is bitter-sweet.",1

Crying the second I’m alone,"Hi guys I have a question if you’re willing to answer. I’m 17 and I’m not very close to my parents so I live with my bf of two years 90% of the time. When I go to my dads house for a random few days that he says he wants to see me (but really doesn’t talk to me, he mostly looks at me like I’m a fish in a fishbowl) I pretty much feel the deep sadness sink in. I am teary eyed the whole time I am here. He doesn’t talk to me much and we live alone in a large house. I’m downstairs, he’s upstairs. I just wanna know why I feel this pit in my stomach and heart whenever I’m alone and I don’t have my boyfriend every step of the way. Am I just lonely or is it a larger issue at hand like some trauma I haven’t yet dealt with or anything else ?


Also side question: how does one actually overcome trauma and childhood trauma because for a while I thought I have but whenever I deeply think about things or talk about certain things I just bawl my eyes out. 

Thankyou for taking your time to read my silly rant. I hope you have a good day and God bless you all 💙",1
seasonal depression tips?,"i’m starting to feel it trying to kick in and i’m looking for tricks or tips or things to do that will help me get through it

What if I don’t want to get better,"I (16f) have been struggling for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I struggled with depression, and had much deeper thoughts than I should’ve been having. I don’t exactly remember a time when I was happy. Now I feel like getting better and being happier would erase all that makes me who I am. I go to therapy but everything seems centered on “getting better” when I’m still struggling with even wanting that. I just feel like I was made to be sad and I almost enjoy the feeling. Is that wrong? I feel like I’m ruining everyone around me’s life by letting myself wallow like this but I don’t know how to even start desiring change. I don’t exactly want to off myself either, I just…want to continue rotting like this. Has anyone else ever felt like this? I feel like i’m crazy or a bad person or something.",1
I just... hate life,"Fuck everybody who says life is beautiful or a blessing or good. I will never believe life is inherently a ""gift"" whether it's meant from a ""gift from god"" standpoint or a ""lucky we are even here"" standpoint. Whatever the fuck you believe, being alive is a curse and even perfectly ""healthy"" people use these stupid fucking coping mechanisms to convince themselves that the suffering is normal.

I'm enraged at this part of me that still wants to hold out hope that I will accomplish my goals. That I'll get a girlfriend. That I'll get a job I like. Find hobbies I'm good at. Fuck all of it. Fuck me. This worthless piece of shit that thinks it still has a chance. Pathetic.

I'm so angry I won't kill myself. I'm furious. Because this life does not deserve to be cherished. And as disgusting as it sounds, I do not want the people who think that life is good to think they ""won me over"" by me staying alive. I want them to know I suffer every damn minute here and that it is their fault, even though I know it is truly mine. I will never fully accomplish anything. I will never gain anything. If I want to slit my wrists what the fuck does it even matter? Fuck everything and everybody. Me staying here is only torture. So congrats to everyone I guess. I will suffer longer. I will never be happy. I even fucking try to be happy. And all I get is shit. I've lost almost everything that made me feel safe, but someone will tell me I haven't because they know me so fucking well. I hate you. I hate me. And this is my only way to express that. Hell, it's wild to me that even saying all of this feels like I'm only expressing 1% of my true feelings on everything. FUCK FUCK FUCK.

Fucking please... if there is any sort of fucking god out there. Please kill me. Please please please. This is torture on so many fucking levels. I can't keep this up. Wanting to live hurts and wanting to die hurts. But I'm sure I'll be here tomorrow. And that is more excruciating than anything else...",1

Explaining myself (please help),"Hi :)
1 or 2 months ago i finally had enough courage to open up to my best friend about my mental struggles, about my depression and my suicidal thoughts. I also planned on explaining to him more detailed how i feel in person. We went on a walk together in a forest, but i just couldn't say anything. My mind shut down completely, as if i myself didn't know what i was struggling with anymore, even though i think i know what I'm struggling with. 
He told me that I'm important to him and that i can always reach out to him. And he even told me that he was thankful that i told him. Ngl that made me cry. But i still think he doesn't really understand how bad i am, and i don't blame him at all, i haven't brought it up anymore since then. I really want to explain myself better to him so he can understand me better. But i always think I'm bothering him too much with it. Whenever i express my emotions or feelings, they feel fake. I don't know why, i always feel so fucking dumb expressing my feelings. Positive and negative ones but mainly negative ones. I just can't express them, and it really doesn't help that we're both really socially awkward. I'm thinking about writing him another message where i explain myself a little more, but i just don't know where to begin. 
I thought if i opened up to him, everything would get easier.
Guess i was too naive.
If anyone has some advice on how i can explain myself better to him, I'd appreciate it very much.

Like, simply laughing with someone or siblings by the drawings or memes we make. Then I'll be like damn, if i did end it will they still be laughing or enjoying themselves at this hour. I would have never witnessed or feel this type of moment. I will eventually feel terrible after thinking about it, which will ruin the whole mood 

This guilty aftertaste of moments I have ruins everything I've enjoyed and it still haunts me till this day. I've tried so many times to just be grateful that I've expirienced it, that I've gone through it and didn't end my life, but my mind does not let me. 

It sucks to have my pride and guilt battle on every decision I make, that causes these mixed emotions. It makes me crazy and idk if someone can understand me anyway.

What do I do?,"Lil vent type beat

I’ve been so depressed (on and off, but mostly on) for a long time I don’t know what to do. I’ve been trying my best to be positive and just do my best but it’s not working. Every day I wake up and wish this wasn’t my life. I lack the energy to do anything meaningful. I just scrape by day after day. I wanna get shit rolling with these music projects but fuck I don’t put even a tenth of the work I could be putting in rn. I’m really passionate about it but I just can’t engage with it most of the time. I guess that’s what depression is. It doesn’t matter how capable I am or how much believe in myself, I just feel too hopeless to even try. It’s frustratingly irrational. I’m in so much pain. I feel like a zombie. The worst part is knowing I can do better. I’m mentally ill. I don’t have the motivation to seek support. It’s insane I’ve made it this long without ending my life. I tried a few years back. Unless I pretend to myself that I’m okay and that this world is bearable, I think about suicide nearly every day. To fantasise about it puts me into a path of suicidal>sad>cathartic>hopeful>motivated, but I don’t think that’s healthy. I won’t do it because I feel like there is a chance I make it and maybe I’ll be content someday. But at the same time nothing is moving forward, nothing is changing. I’m struggling. I can’t keep going like this.

Is that normal?,"I don’t get it. I understand why teenagers have sex, but, as a teen myself, I think it’s wrong and that they’re growing up too fast. Now the emotions related to sex is natural. I get that. Hell, I’m no stranger to that myself. But the action? I think it’s risky, even if you are wearing protection and you’re being as safe as you can. There are existing negative effects. But, then again, now that I think about it, there are negative and positives to everything we do. 


I wish I didn’t care about things so much. I hate hearing my friends talk about people they know in our school that have or had sex. It actually angers me; I feel that i’m the only one out of my friends that see everything “normal” as a teenager is wrong, in a way, and that we shouldn’t be so willing to accept things that are “normal” as “right” and “true.” 

But, maybe I’m mad because that’s something I’d never do because I care too much. If I didn’t care so much, i’d be cool and mellow like my friends; I wish I didn’t care. I’d definitely do drugs, drink, and maybe have sex like everyone else does in my school. They don’t care, and that isn’t killing them. They’re living their lives and acting “young and dumb,” just like they’re expected to act, while I’m over here acting like an adult and worrying about college and how I will financially support myself as an adult. 

My life would be so much better if I stopped caring. I think I might do that, really. I want to try weed when I’m out of the house. I’ll try the gummies and maybe vape as well. I just want something that will make me feel woozy and sleepy and relaxed and…”out of it.” I want to feel high and forget everything and just feel woozy and have everything feel nice and slow..",1

My trauma was brought up as a way to hurt me,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This will be long so thank you for taking the time to read it.  
  
Hey everyone I'm a 23 year old guy and I've been dealing with depression, anxiety and ptsd for about 6 years now. I was diagnosed last year and I'm currently on medication and I've been to therapy. I've been feeling better in every aspect other than focusing on doing the things I enjoy. I still feel very anxious and stressed out whenever I have to deal with any tasks that pertain to my future career.  
  
My parents are the root cause for most of my issues and due to certain circumstances I don't have the means to move out of my house. I don't discuss my mental health problems with them either. All they know is I have depression and I'm taking meds for it. Depression didn't make it easier for me to make friends and the ones I did have, I've moved away from them as they started to become hateful towards certain groups of people. So I don't have anyone to share what I go through and I didn't need anyone as I was doing better up until last night.  
  
I met this girl a couple of moths ago and honestly I felt heard and seen for the first time in my life. She's neuro divergent just like me. We have the same interests too. She was kind and I felt comfortable enough to share my trauma with her, tell her stuff that I haven't told anyone except my therapist. We grew very close to each other and she has even admitted that we are indeed very close.  
  
Last night I jokingly made a comment about her favourite author saying that I can write better than him and while laughing called him a chump. I wasn't trying to insult her, her taste in the author or the author himself. I thought she would find it humorous. But she got very upset telling me that it's unacceptable and that we're different people and she has no interest in me anymore. She then proceeded to bring up my trauma and used it as an insult against me. The same way my parents have done numerous times, which she knows about.  
  
When I explained to her how horrible it made me feel all she had to say was that she was in a bad mood that she was sorry. It didn't feel like she meant it and she followed up by telling me that's all she can say and that she has no interest in talking to me anymore.  
  
I feel the worst that I've felt in years. I feel all the progress that I had made has completely gone away. I don't understand how someone who cares about me could say such awful things. I get that she was upset but I don't think it was a proportionate response.   
  
I just want to know how I can move on and cope with this as I feel defeated. I thought I'd ask people if they have been through something similar, monumentally hurt by someone who you thought understood and cared about you. Any advice or insights you can offer me would be very appreciated. Thanks guys.",1
Why do I even try,"I‘m 30 and my life isn‘t the hardest, but it was before I got to the point I‘m at. I struggle daily to ever feel happy. Sure I play it off that I‘m in a good mood or what have you but deep down I just don‘t care. I‘m nice and seem to be treated well for the most part, but people I just can‘t take life around me anymore. I get up everyday for the one person I actually care about, my dad, the only person who’s ever been there for me for my entirety. Watching him suffer hurt me the most. I try my best but my best isn‘t good enough. I get so mad, I end up hating everyone, and seems that I am in the wrong because my buddy mistreated me and I lashed out. Wow cool I‘m the bad guy when I feel fucked over, ignored and or lied to. I am so sick of it all. I feel so fucking numb, empty and hallow. I just don‘t know how much more I can personally take. My mind is going all directions, I‘m sad and hurt, pissed and frustrated but I rather just not even be here. And nobody has to comment because I already know what you‘ll say, „Oh talk to a therapist“. Why, why does that matter, it‘s not like depression disappears cause you talk to some quack in a chair try to tell you your own issues that I already know. I feel so fucking alone, doesn‘t matter if I‘m in a room of people or not, they don‘t understand or think I‘m a fucking nutjob. I just don‘t even know anymore. Just rather end it, but I can‘t thats selfish of me to rid the world of my own stupidy. I‘m just sad, I cry myself to sleep most days. I don‘t know how to handle my own emotions right now. I have so much more but it doesn‘t even matter.",1
What should I do?,"I'm sorry for the bad english, its not my first language. I just want to share what I'm feeling right now. I don't know what I should do with my life anymore. I lost interest of everything even to myself. I don't have goals anymore and I don't care what would happen to my career. I feel like even if I die tomorrow, I wouldn't care. I'm scared of what I am now. My peers are like getting engaged, building a family, having career growth and here I am just existing. I don't like this feeling anymore.",1
Losing romantic feelings and just not caring about anything anymore,"Unfortunately, it's all coming back with a vengeance. I feel like I alternate between feeling nothing and feeling numb, to the point that I am losing all the love feelings for my girlfriend. I genuinely regret dragging her into my life and exposing her to this. The last week has been so bad that I can tell you with confidence a belt wedged into my doorframe will hold my weight. I was halfway hoping I would misjudge the lack of bloodflow, and I'd pass out before I thought I would. I'm not even sure I have the guts to do it, when I really want to.

I haven't really eaten the past couple of days. I haven't felt like it, or doing anything, really. I spent a few hours crying yesterday. I don't even want to be touched. She tries. I know she is there for me. I just don't care.

I don't really have problems. I have money, and most other things I want/need. I'm in therapy. I take medication (3rd/4th different ones now.) Irrelevant. Wish I'd get hit by a bus today.",1
Was told I should be ashamed for mental breakdown,"Kinda a follow up to my last post.

I had actually gotten better. My mom ended up helping me through it (albeit still not in the best way but I digress).

Today though I was supposed to go see my cardiologist but at the last minute, my mom changed it and only told me afterwards. 

I was shocked and in disbelief, to which I didn’t hide.

My dad comes barging in yelling at me: “She’s SICK! And you’ve been treating her like shit! You’ve done nothing but yell at her! You should be ashamed!”

To clarify, I won’t deny that I did lash out, but I was having a mental breakdown, I didn’t have the best control over myself. But afterwards, I went back to taking care of my mom, doing everything she asked and getting all she needed.

I explained that to my dad and he got even more furious.

“NO YOU HAVE NOT!”

My jaw dropped and I looked at my mom.

“She has been taking care of me.” She said quietly.

“OH, BULLSHIT!”

“She has.”

“BULLSHIT! BULL! SHIT!”

I shook my head as he stormed out of the room. My mom didn’t say anything else and left too. He hasn’t done a damn thing and today is the first time I’ve heard him even acknowledge she was sick. 

He acts like he couldn’t have taken me himself. I really need to go to that appointment but my mom is sick, I’m apparently faking depression and my breakdowns and I’m really just a spoiled brat that is a horrible person.

We live next to a busy road, I’m thinking about just getting it over with that way. It’s already stained with the blood of my first dog, so why not? Besides, I already feel numb. Just hoping it’ll be fast.",1
I can't stand this,"So I'm an alcoholic and all around loser. I have one friend that is getting tired of my bullshit because I can't fake happy anymore and I'm also a fucking dick when I'm drunk. I just wanna drink until I'm gone. I'm too fucking tired. I tried to get better but my feelings stay the same. I'm always on the verge of tears. I wish I could have a life, with a family and maybe a couple kids. I don't think that's really possible for me though. I've never met anyone that can stand too close to me for long. It feels like there's a really important part of being a regular person that I'm missing. The people around me can feel that. I keep wishing I'd get whisked away by an out of control car or that I would take a stray bullet to the head. I don't know what and if there's anything I can do. Maybe I was just born shit.",1
I feel totally screwed up in my life,"Hello. I hope this place is suitable for my post. I don't know where else I should put it. 

Most of the time of my life I feel like drowning. And it doesn't matter how many times I asked for help. It looks like it never worked. And I never recieved **real** help. From time to time I am having something I call *mental breakdown* in past I had 2 days of screaming from so much frustration and yesterday it was heavy and long non stoping crying. I just feel so screwed up by everything what happened to me. It feels like going crazy! I thought I can heal it but came yesterday to realization that I am not able to heal all this stuff in this life(time).

Emotional neglect in childhood. No male in our family. Absent dad was highly possibly a narcissist. Mom emotionally unavailable. But she is kinda immature and very sensitive in some things but never really helped me or stand up for me. Nobody explained to me periods / menstruation. Never had the mom with who you say to each other ""I love you"". She is hoarder and our living place = flat looks horrible. Plus being born into poverty. 

And I know how people think that you can earn money and change your life. But I can't. I tried and keep failing. Depression caused me debts. I attracted only toxic manipulators and narcissists in my life and what is worse I feel attracted towards them. 

During my life I tried several psychologists - nobody helped. And some of them were very unprofessional! Laughing at my expressions of anger when I was younger. Another one was the whole time staring into my eyes, never looked else where and it had effect like writing into journal. NO REAL HELP! And they even say they just can navigate people and not help. BUT THATS NOT REAL HELP! Sorry for my frustration but I think If someone is getting bullied - they need immediate help! And not this. (I also think that as I was bullied at age 12 by boys in my class screwed me up the most because in that time I started to have first thoughts about not living and since then I have depression from time to time). I feel so helpless. 

Never had confidence and the jerks I was dealing with, screwed me up even more. I never experienced real love. Never was in real normal relationship but instead I got mentally and emotionally damaged from manipulators, jerks and narcissists who I knew online. Even when one of them was from my country. 

I attract these types and even worse - I am also attracted to them. Even tho I don't want and there is zero possibility for normal or real relationship with them since they are fake and toxic. I am so fed up with this all. 

No matter how much self help books I read, trying to change myself, heal wounds, focus on self love, affirmations, EFT, talking with myself in mirror, hypnose - Nothing is helping! 

I just wanna find love. Find someone normal. But how can I now after being even more damaged? And how can I change who I attract and feel attracted too? 

I feel so lost. 

Lately I tried therapy. Wasted a lot money on it for a few nice words. I can't afford this wasting. I need real help. 

I had hope that I can heal myself with self help books and focusing on self development. But it doesn't change anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't even help myself. I don't wanna have wasted life like this.",1
sad about being so alone,Birthday was today not one person remembered. Not really a surprise I'm alone every birthday and holiday. Starts to eat at you after awhile and wonder if the world would be better off without me or would it be exactly the same because not one person would care or know I was gone. Just dragging myself through the years...,1
How do you get over the feeling of being a burden by talking about how you feel.,"For the past six months I have felt so alone. My entire life really I have always been the person to respond positively when asked how am doing, how’s school, how’s work, how’s whatever. I’ve always said the same thing to everyone. I couldn’t imagine worrying my mom or dad or girlfriend or brother about how I feel. 

Lately I am getting really worried about myself like I feel like I’m on a pattern of self destruction. My performances have really dropped at work, I’m waisting lots of money, and I have no regard for my future self in any sense. I just need someone to talk to without worrying the people I loved. 

I’m scared these tendencies where I care less about my future self could develop into more serious suicidal tendencies. I’m not there yet for a lot of reasons so don’t worry. I’m just worried it will get there one day. I’m really sure I would never do anything because there is still that overwhelming feeling of still protecting my loved ones.",1
What's the point?,"I really wish to be happy, but it feels like the whole world is actively trying to destroy me.
Can't remember the last time I felt any joy.

Today my boss at work called me stupid and incompetent, and I feel like he's right.

I've lost all my trust in people.",1
Gonna be 18 and depressed,i can’t believe that next year im gonna be 18 im probably gonna be as miserable as i am now lol i hate my life i hate how im wasting my life away to depression,1
My dreams are dying,"Hey guys, im losing a grade in school the thing is that this was suposed to be my last year, i just came here with a lot of help from my friend and now i will be alone again for a whole year, now i lost my chance of getting into the army or the police that was my dream, it all happened due to a episode of depression i had at the start of the year, theres nothing i can do, i numb the pain with porn and screen  because i feel like i cant bear it, everything came tumbling down, the girl i though was the one didnt even recognized me as friend at all, my dreams are dead already im just waiting for them to stop breathing.",1
will this ever end?,"16m last year something very (like VERY) traumatic happened to me, ever since that moment i just cant skip school. last year i used to skip like 3 times per week and trust me that i was mentally broke (i also started drinking a lot) 

now this year i feel better, but still not good, every week i skip one day (great advance i guess) but its still fucked up. ofc my teachers are well aware about what happened to me and even when they can empathize to me a little, they still put me horrible grades (i mean if they didn’t know what happened it would be fair, but they do, so its fucked up) 

this is my last year and my last days, my grades are very bad but trust me, i feel very blue most of the time so just going there to do nothing is a big effort to me

i know my mom understands me, thats why she let me skip and doesnt get angry when she see my grades or something, but anyway i feel very guilty sometimes, seeing her work a lot and me skipping whenever i want, but trust me, i feel like shit most of the time!!!!!!",1
I keep fucking up,"I keep trying to make more friends, get good academic results, improve myself but its just all fucked up. Why do I even try? Im so numb and tired of trying. I think my childhood abuse has turned me into a empty shell and Im just a zombie without much emotions. I exercise and try new things but I feel so empty so numb. Im tired of feeling like this. I dont want to live for a long depressed and miserable life.",1
Find it difficult to do anything,"Since I have fallen deeper into my depression, I struggle with doing tasks such as cleaning, doing work etc and it pains me so deeply. I have so many responsibilities and duties to fulfill and when I don't complete them, I am told that I am lazy, rude and incompetent. It makes me feel sad when people can have clean houses, study and do so much work as if it's second nature unlike me, who fails miserably time and time again. 

These are the times where I don't want to be me anymore, I have more vices than virtues and I have failed myself and others. Right now all I do is sleep because this despair I feel is inescapable. If someone can offer me advice 

I would be grateful. Usually when I do tasks I listen to albums but even now I suffer with doing that. Things are not the same anymore",1
The only thing that levers me out of depression is travelling.,"Other than travelling, nothing else does it. 

Good sex, forget it. Never had it. Never probably will.

Job I enjoy? Fat chance. Tried working that one out for over 20 years. 

If I could wonder around the world with my camera and live in hostels having awesome conversations and memories with strangers I meet along the way for the rest of my life, I'd be happier.",1
it’s hard,"Hello everyone/anyone that reads this.

I am 16, have both parents, a dog, a cat, I do really good in school, play football, but I don’t know what I’m doing.

It’s been like this for a while, but I’m either depressed or bipolar. Ever since I moved in 2017, I’ve been lost.

My cousin died when I moved here and that really hit me at the time. I didn’t know anyone where I live and I had no one, so I kinda just learned to deal with it on my own.

I eventually got the friends I needed but I’ve never really hung out with them, it’s just an inevitable thing that we’re around each other enough that we kinda have to get along.

A year after I moved, I told my mom I was suicidal by writing it on a notecard, but I didn’t really understand what I was saying so when she took me to get help I didn’t really try to receive the help because it was embarrassing. All that telling my mom did was make it so that I wouldn’t let her see that side of me again, because I hated seeing her so worried about me.

Now, I’m a junior in high school, doing pretty well, but I have no real friends. All my life I’ve never really had a real friend, definitely not a best friend. I see everyone else who has people they hang out with and it’s just weird. 

I became a vegetarian when I moved here because I felt bad for the unnecessary violence and I knew could give it up. But all that did was distance me from others and get me bullied.

I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I focus on school, and relationships come later. But because of my “ideals” I don’t do anything.

This year I told myself I’d go out more and I did, but the improvement was from nothing to almost nothing. I got into my first relationship that I ended after 3 months because I failed to become open with her, so then she accused me of cheating on her. I went to one get together with my friends, where I didn’t drink, everyone else did, and I felt so alone. My “best” friend, who I know the feelings aren’t reciprocated, pulled me in at the end of the night and told me it made him sad that we didn’t hang out and he promised we would more often. That was about 4 months ago and I know no plans will be organized.

I’m now talking to a girl, but she doesn’t really know me and I’m worried that I’ll just mess it up again and not be able to become open and just hurt her and distance myself from the closest resemblance I have to a friend.

I’ve never talked to anyone about my feelings because I’m too embarrassed but I cry myself to sleep seemingly every night.

My only identities are that I don’t eat meat (which I’m thinking about giving up), I’m smart (but it’s just a school thing, I’m stupid in reality), and I play football (which goes away in a year and then I lose the connections to my friends from football and I know I’ll lose those bonds).

My only real copes are others have it worse and it’s my fault. I don’t want to talk to people about my feelings, hell, I even made another reddit account, even though no one knows I have even one account, just so that I could make a post here.

I’m still depressed but I could never end it all I know. I’m worried I’m heading down that path because last night I started thinking about pinching and cutting.

I know that it’s my fault.
I know that my solution is probably simple.
I know that this is too much to read.
I know that no one else probably cares.
I know that this won’t get big and get a lot of comments.

I just needed to say it.

Thank you to anyone who reads this…",1
I ended my life when i was 19. I am now 21,"I don't know what to say really but I need to. June 17, 2021, I tried to end my life, and  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to live now, hell I'm not entirely sure why I did it in the first place. there's a number of reasons it could be but what the final straw was I have no clue.  
I was failing my first year of university, I was ending my teen years without a single relationship, I hated how I looked and I hated everything I did because it was always, in some aspect, wrong. Yet I survived, thankfully in most ways, but sometimes I come to regret it.   


I regret messaging my friend so early after taking the pills. I regret the pain and sadness I saw in my family. I regret my moment of weakness. But every now and then, I regret not making it quick or doing it right the first time.  


Then my family and friends would only be sad once, and I would never be again. Since that night I have ruined so many things. I can no longer join the army, I had always wanted to be a pilot. I have since failed and been expelled from my university. I have not been able to develop a single relationship in my entire life. I cant allow it I guess, as I don't understand why anyone would want to be anywhere near me.  


But I can't do it again. I cant bare to know that my brother and parents will miss me. I cant do it to them again.  


I don't Know what to do.",1
I dont think it’s possible to get better,"I’ve been depressed since I was like 12. I can’t remember a time I was actually happy though. I went to the mental hospital for a bit and finally got on medication, but it doesn’t seem to help at all. I’m just tired of feeling tired. I’m too tired to see my family or friends. The thought of getting up or something simple like brushing my hair is exhausting. I keep going to work and putting on a smile and being the happy person they like, but slowly that mask is breaking. I don’t think I can do it much longer, but I don’t want to hurt my family. I just wish they could understand how hard it is to live feeling this pain all the time.",1
I need to find whether it is depression or something else,"So in the past few days I've started to have this very wierd thing like making myself unattached thinking I will ghost all of my friends in future.

Not having much conversation with my family and friends. Not getting along. Living in delusion like that. Idk what I've rn and in the moment what I'll have in brain.

What is Happening to me :(,"So recently i’ve been suffering quite badly with essentially 24/7 anxiety/ DPDR and Depression - Ive been feeling more and more spaced out 24/7 as my post history will showcase 

However last night I had one of my crying breakdowns (not even sure why as im
Suffering with blank mind currently) - And then I had a really strange feeling like I couldn’t visualise anything I had done during the day, I also felt extremely disconnected to everything and even my bodily sensations felt weird (swallowing, wiggling my toes etc) - Ive now woken up with this awful headache at the back which was at the front yesterday, feeling almost delirious and confused, very spaced out again and feel like my brain is shutting itself down

I don’t even know how im writing this to be honest as it doesn’t feel like im in control or would know how to say any of this :(",1
I'm so fucked,"I just wrecked my second car and I'm losing my mind over it. I hit and icy patch and ran into a pole.

I don't know how to get over the thought and now I'm paranoid about driving again.",1
Not caring for others,"Hello,

Recently I’ve noticed that I have stop caring for others as much as I used too. I’m actually worried that I’ve always been like this and this is my true self. I was told that I wander off in conversations and go on my phone whenever the other person is talking about something deep, this is the first time ever I have exhibited this behavior and usually I’m conscious of it. But as of recent like the past couple of months I haven’t cared as much.

I realize at times that I end up going on tangents when I speak to people talking a lot about myself. Some one say I’m a Conversational Narcissist which makes me sad because I never thought I’d get like this. But I can see and feel what others mean, I feel like I’m always thinking of myself, how will this affect me, about my own feelings and what I wanna do. Before I was pretty balanced but now I can feel myself being a bit resistant to others thoughts.

I feel like I have been giving less effort towards others, when it comes to conversations I hardly ask follow up questions, or it’s hard for me to be genuinely interested (not saying what the other person is talking about is not interesting) but just when I hear someone talk I start to zone out and dissociate. I feel bad, but I do feel like it’s my genuine feelings. I want connection but maybe I truly don’t because I’m not willing to give others space or time in a relationship without feeling frustrated or annoyed. 

It’s like this feeling of wanting to have my cake and eat it too. But I’m upset that I feel this way and that I’m leaning more into it, I’m a therapist for khrist sake so I feel ashamed. Like am I an evil person?",1
Need someone to talk to,I’m in bad shape need to talk to someone,1
Yesterday was a so so day,"I’ll try to make this quick because I just wanna get it out. I haven’t always dealt with depression, I used to be a mostly happy and content kid growing up even with the circumstances I had growing up. Growing up my mom was mentally abusive and sometimes would get physical. I always just chalked it up as everyone from NYC is crazy like that.  My dad wasn’t really in the picture because he was off “working”. So I grew up doing a lot for myself alone. I have a brother and they were affected a lot more than I was and really went through depressive episodes growing up and doing self harm. Seeing how much home life affected them, I sheltered myself and was in my own bubble. Fast forward a bit and things have gotten better. My mom worked on herself to be a better person and my dad tried to be more present. I always understood why my mom was abusive because her mom was 1000x more abusive. My mom didn’t want to be like her mom but sometimes it would come out. I don’t consider my moms mom my grandmother because she’s not a grandmother to me. My cousins feel the same, she’s a terrible person.  Really just tons of generational trauma because my “grandmothers” mother was abusive as well. So anyhow, a couple years ago one of my family members committed suicide, chronic depression runs in this family! Because of the situation when my cousin took their life, I self medicated with alcohol and weed. I booked the flight for my mom and I that night. Unfortunately I was not able to attend to the funeral because I bought the wrong flight for the next week. Everyone was in such shock that someone so bubbly, happy, and just all around an amazing person took their own life. My whole family thought her suicide was a setup. It wasn’t until the day of the flight on the way to the airport that I noticed it was for the wrong date. My mom freaked out and punched me in the mouth. We get to the airport hoping that showing an obituary would let the airlines change the flight. They wouldn’t. So my mom went and I stayed back because I couldn’t afford another ticket. I self medicated a lot that night. Went to a club, blacked out and sniffed drugs from a stranger that night to numb the situation. Was extremely depressed afterwards for months. So fast forward to yesterday, it was my deceased family members birthday. It really triggered me. Self medicated with shrooms and ketamine. I had a good day out keeping busy walking around the city. It was when I got home that I got so anxious and the thoughts came rushing in. I ended up swallowing a bar of Xanax and just passed out from 6pm till this morning. Idk where I’m going with this, but if my family member didn’t take their own life I would take my own. Knowing that pain that everyone endured has kept me from taking my own life. Everyday I’m out I hope that there’s a drive by, someone robs and kills me, or I do drugs laced with fent. I live in the city so those are all very possible and it would make it so much easier for everyone to deal with my death. I don’t want to die, I’m just ready for it. I love life and often have great days. I meditate, remove myself from negative energy and people, and do well most days. Just some days are really hard like yesterday. I’ve been single my whole life because of my parents relationship and I know that I need to let that go, but I don’t want to be with someone that doesn’t truly love me. Idk if I had someone to hold me in moments like yesterday, maybe I wouldn’t struggle as hard. Rant over. I would tell this all to a shrink but finding mental health resources isn’t all that easy since I have no health insurance. Hope yall have a great day 👍🏽",1
I need help in accepting that I have a mental illness that requires medical treatment. I'm having a hard time in doing so,"I can't help but think ""what if I donìt actually need medication?"" or ""what if I'm just overthinking this and I don't even have a problem in first place?"" when it's clear that I'm highly limited by my symptoms.

I can only do work from home job(s), that I don't even like. I cannot enjoy the things I used to. Despite pushing through a lot of fears (2 years ago I had serious trouble in buying groceries) I still don't feel internally good. Even if I push through the fears, I won't even enjoy it anyways. I cannot manage a long lasting romantic relationship. My libido is basically non-existent. My social life is definitely impacted in a negative way.

A lot of symptoms got better for sure, but in 4 years I still have to experience a full 24hour day where I am symptom-free and feel good. The record so far has been having half-day of feeling like if I'm normal.

Living life with those type of limitations and pain is not worth, and I don't even want to live like this anyways, there would be no point.

I tried literally everything I can: went to 3 different therapists, studied psychology topics, applied CBT/DBT/ERP, fixed my vitamins deficiencies, increased my social skills, got into a solid workout routine, meditation and so on. There isn't one thing that I haven't tried.

I truly hate the fact that I have to rely on a medication in order for me to feel normal  
\- I feel less compared to other people that don't have this type of problems ""what if I need to learn something from this, what if I'm not doing something that other people normally do, what if I snap out of it""  
\- I feel that my life is ruined either ways. If i take medication I'll be dependent on it to feel normal, if I don't take it I'm pleagued to live the rest of my life like this, which I don not want to (I dealt with my fair share of suicidal thoughts)  
\- I feel that even if I'll be normal and feel happy, it would be fake. I would feel happy and anxiety-free only because a drug is doing ""something that I should be doing""  
\- I feel ashamed, none of my friends know about this cause I can't handle the negative stigma around it  
\- I know that you can take it for a period of time and you don't have to be on it for the rest of your life, but I don't know if that will be my case",1

Does getting a pet help?,"I have been dealing with some shit for a while now (I’m 18 and in my 1st semester of college rn) and I am lonely. I struggle to find any meaning in my life and I am barely motivated to even leave my room. I haven’t eaten more than 1 full meal every 1-2 days for about a month now, and the only time I’ve left my apartment was to see my family for Thanksgiving. I realized that I feel a lot better when I am around other people and animals, but I’m not sure if I should get one. I currently have 5 roommates, but I wouldn’t say I’m very familiar with any of them. We rarely speak and the longest I’ve actually spent with them has been about 2 hours. I want to make some close friends, but I have horrible Social Anxiety and Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder (its a form a autism) that have made it almost impossible for me to make any friends since elementary school. Clearly, I am horrible with people, but I have always liked spending time with animals. I have been thinking about adopting one, but I am not sure if I am ready for that. I am struggling to keep myself alive at this point and I am not sure if I am even capable of taking care of an animal right now. I think that having a pet will give me the motivation I need to fix myself and to be better, but I am worried that I might neglect their needs like I have my own. This semester is coming to an end, and I think now would be a good time to adopt an animal seeing as how I am moving apartments and getting new roommates, but I don’t know if this is really whats best for me. I don’t really know how long I can last living like this, and I need to change something soon. So I need to ask, can getting a pet help? Does anyone have any experience with a situation like this?",1
I'm tired of my mom being so passive aggressive and I'm planning on killing myself tomorrow,I'm genuinely so tired of having no one to come to with my problems. My mom has no idea how to deal with me unless im happy. I have zero friends to talk to and I spend almost every day now laying in bed unmotivated to do any of my schoolwork. The beginning of this year was going so well but towards the end it started to get all fucked. A week ago I tried killing myself with a kitchen knife but it was too dull to cut through my wrists so I didn't go through it didn't break the skin or anything. I'm tired of my mom always giving me a death stare now it's like she's mad at me for being depressed. Doesn't help that she doesn't accept me for coming out as trans either. Someone please help I don't know what to do.,1
Am I depressed or just experiencing apathy?,"16F, at the start of this year, I joined Reddit and posted on r/help me about my lack of motivation and my failing grades. Now, its 4:21 AM and I was wondering why I feel like this again, why I was feeling burnt out because that's what a comment suggested I was feeling.

I'm just barely through the 1st semester (sophomore), and I don't think its burnout because I just feel empty. I felt empty a lot through the summer, and I'm failing AP Euro and slacking severely in art and not even my boyfriend can give me motivation to do my work and such. 

I still enjoy things like playing games or talking to my friends, but I don't have any actual, real life people I'm friends with at school. It's hard for me to make decisions, it always has been, and during my entire time in highschool I've been feeling really empty and that it's been hard to motivate myself to even shower. I don't know if I'm depressed or not, but I do want to do something with my life, I just don't believe I can. I wanna be better for myself, but also so I don't fall behind. Even my old best friend who I haven't spoken to since like January 6th of this year who dropped out of school in 6th grade (didnt go to 7th, just got back in contact with them on Thanksgiving) is doing better in school than I am now that they're enrolled again. 

I've never been the type to go above and beyond in school unless it was something that I was passionate about like writing or drawing, but now I can't even finish one short story without writer's block or make myself draw in class. I know this is probably unnecessary but I just need to rant but I'm ending it here.



TL;DR: Am I depressed, or just apathetic? And is there anything I can do to help with either???
Also idk if this is coherent or not I'm soory 💀",1
I'm spiraling again,"I'm spiraling again, I feel like i don't want to recover though i do. ive been spaced out over 53% of the past month. I'm so tired yet i can not sleep, when i do sleep i feel even more tired, My physical health is declining too. I don't want to spiral again.",1
I’m not even real.,"I just feel like pieces of me are being picked away. My sister is constantly doing better than me and all I am to her is a lap dog, a helper, a servant. Just somebody who watches her flourish. That’s all my family recognises me as as well. They can tell I’m nothing. This may sound stupid but, I’m always critiqued and criticised for what I like but then my sister turns around and does the same thing and she’s praised. I’m such a sensitive and hollow person I rely on superficial things to replace who I really am, so the small snarky remarks hurt me more than the normal person can imagine. All they say is “yeah okay” “it’s ugly” “what is this” “you don’t look like her” “your body’s not like hers” “it’s too sexy for you” “I know who you’re trying to be” and I don’t think they have bad intentions at all but they’re so willing to drop money and compliments on my sister. I heard this cringey TikTok talking about this phrase, it went something like “for once I’d like to be the poem not the poet” it’s not verbatim. I just brushed it off at the time but looking back I realised that I’ve been a poet for so long. I’ve not even been a poet just for my sister, I’ve been a poet for many people, yet never anybodies poem. If anyone replies just know that I know that comparison is the thief of joy but i can’t stop. Im grateful for everything I have and I understand my privilege. I feel bad for feeling bad about feeling this way. Like tiny pieces of me are being snatched away, like I’m losing my true sense of self and like I’m not real.",1
"My family went on a vacation without me, without even telling me, and it’s my fault","Throwaway, because I'm being paranoid. And sorry for any mistakes i will undoubtedly make, since English is not my first language. And warning, this will be very long, but I have a lot on my mind…

  
I’m M35, my sisters are 33F and 30F, and my parents are 70. The first few 7 years of my life were great, I was very much loved and spoiled by my parents. When my sisters came, things got a bit more confusing for me I guess; it was hard to apprehend the world I came to discover around me, and I felt like I had lost my parents’ attention.   
I wasn’t necessarily close to my sisters growing up, or my parents but we did have good times, and even though my parents worked a lot, they made time for us as much as they could, and tried to teach us good values, and tried to make us experience things. Extracurricular activities, sports, arts, museums, concerts, treasure quests, vacations, gifts, honestly, I had it all.   
Both of my parents are orphans, so they made sure we got what they never had: in terms of affections and materials. I got told I was loved daily. But it wasn’t enough, there was something wrong with me. Sadly, they are from a generation where mental health wasn’t a thing, they didn’t notice. I guess they got a crash course with me though; because over the years I developed many issues, starting with a raging depression, addictions, anger issues, trust issues, suicidal thoughts, and whatnot.  
It all started to change when I started middle school in a new school, private this time, and I lost all of the few friends or acquaintances I had. I hate change, I can’t deal with it. And I just felt so misunderstood amidst all that, and I couldn’t voice or articulate my thoughts and feelings and process, and my parents didn’t have the tools to help me. They wanted me to get better opportunities, with better teachers, but it just wasn’t a match for me. I always got into trouble, but for small stuffs, that could be swept aside.  
I didn’t really understand how to make friends, I had to learn how to adapt, and it took its toll on me. I felt judged by everyone and everything, like everyone could see what a fraud I was, how terrified I was. I started to talk back, act rough, even though I was always a very sensitive kid. I got into fights, for myself or others. I got into fights with my parents, sisters and everything. It was rough, but I just felt so alone. I started going out with the wrong crowd, skipping school, smoking weed. A recipe for disaster I know that now. I ended up being expelled from several schools, including a couple of expensive boarding schools. It didn’t work : I felt they were sending me away to be this perfect family without me.  
I know I’ve hurt my family a lot, my parents but my sisters as well, especially 33F. We’ve always had somewhat of a on and off close relationship. I felt, still do, a kinship to her, but I have to admit I was so jealous of her. Everything seemed to come so easily to her. It was very much a love hate relationship, and she took the brunt of several of my rage issues, I was physically and verbally violent, especially toward her. I don’t think I can comprehend how bad I’ve hurt her really, but I know I did. I’ve hurt others and myself as well. I’m sorry. I was a kid too you know?   
I had so much rage in me, I was a ticking bomb and anything could set me off. Over the years, my parents tried everything, always made me go to therapy, but it never seemed to help, and no diagnostic was ever made.   
One or two of my doctors over the years mentioned briefly me being high potential but that was it. After years of highs and lows in my life, mostly lows though, I ended up with a diploma, but I never managed to break through in the field. So got more depressed, more violent. I ruined more than a few vacations, dinner, Christmas’, mother’s days... Most of those celebrations ended in fights because the stress of being enclosed with my family, forced to be together, and not avoid one another in our home, was too high. For all 5 of us actually, even for short periods of times. We were on edge, I see it now.  
Over the years, I’ve watched both of my sisters reached their goal, while I felt like I was just waiting for my life to start, living at my parents’ home, single, mentally ill, being a leech on everyone and making all of us miserable with my issues. I kept waiting for something happen, to change, to help, to end. Then 5 years ago, I tried to get my act together and found a great psychologist. I kept thinking that something else was wrong with me, I wasn’t just in depression, anxiety and an addict. After years of tears and searching, I was finally diagnosed with Asperger. Finally, there was a word to describe me you know? I wasn’t alone. I could be helped.   
I finally got to have some kind of independence from my parents, and seemed to be able to have a polite relationship with my youngest sister, and a great one with my middle one. We got so close, we opened up to one another, I was so happy. She was so much like me. She is the person I’ve felt the closest to. And I got to see and enjoy a few outings with the couple of friends I have left. Life was better, honestly best of my life for sure so far. Struggling, on benefits, but my parents made sure to make my life easier for me, especially financially. My sister called it enabling.  
I’m not saying I didn’t have tantrums for a lack of better words, I did, but I could mostly calm down and get myself out of a negative situation until I was ready to face it less angry. I started to get the hang of it, but every stress in my life was still a challenge to handle. It truly feels like I’ve made a lot of progress ever since. Even though I still feel like a fraud most days.   
Because therapy isn’t magic, during a family diner at my parents place, I snapped for whatever reason and hurled insults and provocations to my family. While I wasn’t violent, I was physically aggressive, threatening and verbally abusive.   
My middle sister hadn’t witness one of those episodes in a while and was shocked. She yelled at me, while crying that I ruin everything. She called me every name in the book, threw some ableist insults as well which I didn’t appreciate. How utterly hypocritical of her to say this, after all those conversations we had on the matter, I felt so much hurt, and on the moment, I felt like getting her back for it. I know it’s not right, and I try to tame it. I ended up leaving, well… the 4 of them ended up throwing me out, while screaming at me. I get it now, but this still hurt. I never fit, not even with my own family.   
That evening I ended up apologizing to my parents, they accepted them but as always after those scenes, they look so weary. I hate this look in their eyes, like I failed once again. Because it’s true, but I try so hard. It’s not enough but I swear I do. But I thought things would go back to normal-ish, I thought that I could apologize, and we could try again to fix our family, and heal ourselves together, because I’ve been getting so much better lately you know. But my middle sister has decided otherwise. She wants low to no contact with me. Only with me. She still sees my sister and parents regularly. I don’t even have my younger sister’s number to apologize, but I know she doesn’t care. She’s the one that hates me the most, even though she’s the one I’ve ignored the most.  
I hate them for it, but I know I deserve it. At first I thought I would wait a couple of days, but it stuck. Mid sis wouldn’t talk to me, take my calls or answer my texts. And I fucked it all up again by in insisting that we move on, and that she was wrong as well. The situation started between me and my parents, she got into it and then she insulted me as well. She hung up quite a few times, then blocked me I can only text her through whatsapp now. She says I’m emotionally blackmailing her. I didn’t believe I was, but I think she is right now. A few weeks after the fights she asked me to organize a meeting between her, my therapist and I. It got ugly once again until my shrink threatened to fire me as a client. But what my sisters says is true, but what I say is true also. We’ve bone been damaged, and I’ve apologized, and I understand. I just wish we could heal together.  
She accepted my apologies, thanked me, apologized as well but she says she doesn’t want a relationship anymore with me. She says she’s not ready, that I make her anxious. She has depression, and she’s being diagnosed soon for ADHD. That it’s not entirely my fault, but I sure didn’t help. That I got so much attention from my parents, as well as my youngest sister for health issues, that she had to teach herself a lot, too much. She protected my sister, herself, even my mom and dad sometimes, against me. She says that she has forgotten herself and her life for years to deal with all of us, and other health issues my family have had over the year. She was sick of being the nice one, and the one we all count on. Unlike me, my sisters never got to see a mental health practitioner.   
She says our parents successfully raised us the way they knew how to, yet they failed at the way we needed. We all have something to be mad at our parents for. She says that she forgives us all, because she knows we all did our best with what we had. Life and family are just messed up sometimes. Still, she says my autism is an explication but not an excuse.   
She texted me that nothing was easy for her either, but she had to make it through. She couldn’t be another problematic child, so she became the people pleaser. The one with whom we all got along better, the easy one, the happy one, the independent one, the older sister, the mediator. She said she had to pick up the pieces of what I broke too many times, literally and figuratively speaking. She says she chooses to not have violence in her life anymore, physical or verbal. That she won’t accept it from anyone ever again. She doesn’t trust me.   
She says that when they are the 4 of them she can breathe. She’s not walking on eggs, none of them are. She says I owe her some peace, and to leave her alone. She says, she’ll reach out if she ever feels the need, but otherwise let’s just see each other on xmax, and parents bdays. Not even her birthday, or mine. It burns so bad. Last month, she, my middle sister, got in contact with my therapist to set up a 4-way session: shrink + my sister + my dad + me.   
Basically, they wanted to tell me that last easter the four of them went on an international and incredible vacation without me, that my parents fully paid for. They didn’t tell me because they wanted to be able to enjoy it. My sister said that she felt a lot of guilt for it, but she knows that it was still the right choice, because I would have ruined it for them. She said that her and my other sister were the reason I wasn’t invited.   
When my parents approached them with the offer, it was their first question: would OP be there? My parents told them it was up to them, and they both said they wouldn’t come if I did. That I had ruined too many vacations in the past, and that our parents are getting old and that they both wanted to experience a peaceful and impactful trip with them. She said that she was absolutely sorry, that she know I must feel horrible. I do. I was furious when they told me. I had to celebrate easter alone, for the first time in my life. I know it seems like nothing, but we have our own traditions around the celebrations. I miss them.   
I knew that my parents were going on this trip, but I didn’t know about my sisters. My mid sister even told me that she couldn’t believe that I didn’t discover it sooner, but then again I never asked to see the pictures. She says I’m still too focused entirely on myself.  
She says, that she didn’t want to lie to me forever, and that’s why she had asked my doctor for advice on how to deal with this. She says it’s not regrets but remorse, and it doesn’t change the situation. It was not a punishment, nor a retribution for my action. It “has nothing to do with you OP, it’s about me, younger sis and our parents, for once”.   
I feel so alone right now. I know things are happening in my sisters’ lives but my parents are not very vocal about it. I wonder if I’ll be invited to their wedding, if they do get married someday? Maybe they have, and haven’t told me yet ha.  
My social circle includes my parents, my 2 dogs and just 2 other friends that I vaguely keep track of. I’m feeling so alone right now and it’s my fault. I don’t feel suicidal but I feel very much lost and sad. I’m seeing my shrink once a week, and I’ll survive this but I’m so tired sometimes. I just want to be held. I want to change and to want to rekindle my relationship with my sisters and my family as a whole and to keep getting better, but I’m afraid it is too late for the former part.

Help,"29M, I am destroying myself by over sleeping in the morning, it leaves me drowsy for the rest of the day and I can't concentrate, I live alone. How do I take responsibility of my own life?",1
am i depressed or is this just a bad time ?,"So , i have had these episodes of ""depression"" i found the word a bit too hard for what i am feeling , when i was younger there were two times were i was very close too unaliving myself , during those time extreme sorrow and loneliness had filled the hole where there were once hapiness. those two times i was able to get myself out of that mindset ,but i felt that i always had a part of me that still was there. with each year i feel like a part of me dies , i become less joyful , less interesting , les interested in things , i no longueur feel the urge to speak to people and everything has become a chore. i was able to conserve parts of myself with the help of my parents who brought me joy and my now ex-girlfriend , just before september i was told that i was going to change schools in a compltely different locations (3 hours from where i origanlly live) , far from my parents the couples of friends that i had and my girlfriend. the day of the break up with my girlfriend she attack my person as whole , i felt left behind, not enough and useless and that feeling never went , its still here after 3 months , i can't sleep without having a nightmare , i don't feel anything( i feel like a shell of my former self) , of cours my ex isn't the main reason i was already pron too going into this state of ""depression"" but with everything that happened recently that was the last push to make me num to everything. i've written a couple of quotes that in my view seem to show my way of thinking. I just want to know if i am in fact in a ""depressive episode "" or that i am just sad and that i will better in time , in short i need your guys opinion. (please keep in mind that english isn't my first language so if you see any errors in grammar or vocabulary thats because i don't have a very good level in english)

Heartbreak :

1)-I feel this constant emotion , going through meAt the beginning it was like needles going through my heartNow it still hurts but now it's constant and it seems to make me num to every other emotion

.2)- Sometimes I dream of you ,it makes me so happy because I was able to see you again but after that I feel measurable knowing that will only happen in my dreams.

3)- Sometimes I don’t feel like eating or doing anything. When you left me , I felt like my purpose in life has left me too…

4)-i feel guilty , guilty of not being at your standards , i know i can show you than i could and will get better , that the mistakes i made will never happen again , but i will never be able to show , since you are now gone far far away

5)- I hate myself , for losing you , to have made you suffer , I feel like I deserve this , I just feel like we didn’t even try to talk and you didn’t even try to understand me or think that I didn't want to make you suffer.

6)- when i see people together it constantly reminds me of you  , what we were , what we could have been , i hate those people , i know that it's unfair to hate them , but it feels unfair , why do they get to be happy while i am lonely and without any way to talk to you , the only thing that i have to console me is the memories of you.

7)- you have made it completely clear that you will never  talk to me again let alone entrain the idea of rekindling  our relationship , i know that it will never happen but somewhere in my mind i still have a little bit of hope that one day i will be able to see you again even if its brief , the idea that i will be able to see you again gives me enough strength to live on.

8)-I don't understand you , you were the one I was closest to , but now we are only strangers. I never thought this would end like this , no contact , giving me no way to talk to you again, i feel like i was only someone that you could completely forgot , while i will never ever  forget you , i feel cheated of my love since it seems that the love that you had wasn’t the same…

9)-I miss your love , but not only that , I miss your laugh , your face , your scent , your nicknames that you gave me… I miss you and what I was when I was with you.

10)-I am doing my best to move on but you made it so difficult , why did you make me so fond of you , so dependent on you . Now that you are gone I feel lonely , my love for you has become a curse that seems that it will never end.

11)I feel awful trying to contact you again , since you ask me to get out of your life but the pain was too unbearable , i feel like shit showing you that i still feel something towards you , but what made me even more measurable is that you respond with indifference and you said “i have completely cut the possibly for you to contact me since i didn’t want to suffer because of you “ , like i would make you suffer , i only want responses to questions that i had inside my head for all this time , i wouldn’t dare make you suffer ,i just wanted my pain to stop , now i will live with this until i become numb to it.

12)I wish I could show you my final message , my final farewell. I still have some much to tell you still and i will never be able to show it to you , that makes my heart break even more.

13)I now have hate for you , why would you let me suffer if you ever loved me , you wouldn’t let me suffer

14)I’ve started to learn to live without you , I still dream about you  almost every night but the pain has now dissipated , I don't feel guilty anymore. I still feel lonely at times but it's bearable now. I still hope that we will see each other one day. I do believe that destiny will make our paths cross again. I will wait for that moment until then I will better myself and become a better person. A part of me will forever love you , goodbye Juju

.Loneliness:

1)Sometimes I feel invincible. I know people don’t see myself that way , it’s more like I feel invincible regarding myself , I don't feel important or relevant, I feel like I am a leaf flowing in the wind without any power over what happens to me.

2)I ask myself why do i feel alone , everyone has someone they can talk to at night i don’t , in school i have friends but it’s not that kind of friend , i just feel that i am not that important to people…

3)I miss you , I miss you so much that when I am with friends it feels odd because you are not there. I miss you at school , I miss you when I am alone , I miss you when I am with my family. I miss you at every moment of my life, I miss my favorite person.

4)I feel lonely, it's so suffocating. I've lost everyone that I love in some way or another and it's horrible , now that I have lost you , I am truly alone.

5)Sometimes I feel like loneliness fades but just before I start to feel included you guys do something without me , showing me once again that people don’t care.

6)I feel alone , no one really cares or takes care of me. It's kind of my fault. I mean I haven 't tried making good relationships with people but I just don’t have the energy anymore , since people just leave me after some time and I become a distant memory.

7)Sometimes I dream of happier times with people I love and appreciate that seem so distant now , since I got used to the overwhelming feeling of loneliness.

8)Sometimes I question my existence. Why am I here? I am not good at anything in particular , I don't have good friends , I don't have anything to convince myself that I have any value , I really am worthless.

9)I want a new life or I want this life to stop. I don’t want to die but I just want the suffering, loneliness and constant heartbreak to stop and sometimes I don't know how to make it stop.

10)Every year I feel like a part of me dies , every year I lose people , every year I lose myself in my sorrow , every year I become less and less happy and my emotions become more and more locked or suppressed and only sadness and indifference fills my head.LivingI don’t want to die but I don't want to live. I am not sad but I am not happy. I want to feel something but I don't feel anything… I want to live but I don't think I am living anymore.I want help but I can't get it. it’s not like people aren’t willing to help , it's more like I want the pain to stop but at the same time that pain seems conformable and i least i know that won't disappear not like everything i have in life.Recently I no longer feel fear towards death , before I didn't fear it but I felt like I had something to live for , now if death strikes me , I wouldn't mind at all. Recently i had a nail in my tire , the mechanic and my family told be to stop driving my car since the tire could pop at any moment, i know i shouldn’t but i drove the car anyway , i went on the freeway , i was calm and clear of mind and i took the risk without a second thought since i didn’t care if my last moment on earth would be inside my car on that highway , since i have nothing to live for.",1

I think my boyfriend has RBD,"Hello,

unfortunately I have to turn to Reddit with my problem as my boyfriend doesn't want to go to a psychologist because of bad experiences in his childhood. He is often mentally unwell with symptoms of depression, but these symptoms usually only last 2-7 days. After that, he returns to normal. I have often had depressive episodes myself, but they have lasted from several weeks to a year.
It's very difficult for me to deal with because some days I have to be very careful and other days he doesn't understand why I'm being so careful. I just want to be there for him but I feel like I'm doing it wrong. Is there anyone here who also has RBD? Or anyone who has any tips on how I can persuade him to see a psychologist? I've tried several times but he feels attacked.

When I had my last severe depressive episode, he was always there for me and when he told me he couldn't cope any more and that I should go to a psychiatric clinic, I did it straight away. But he doesn't even want to see a doctor and somehow that really hurts me.",1

I lie and don't know why,"For context, 17yo male who keeps trying to tell people on this subreddit that life is worth living when I see no reason to myself.

I've been depressed for a while and I believe it got worse when I was in middle school so its been a shit show for a while. Recently went to a therapist and was formally diagnosed with depression even though I lied trying to make it seem like it wasn't that bad. I seriously went out of my own free will and still ended up lying because a saw a single teat running down her face. My own friends seem to be against me in telling me different lies about this and that. One that's particularly fucked with me is that I was told one of then was selling my younger brother alcohol and that was backed up by my other friends but now my brother says it's a lie. I don't know who to believe or why either should stay in my life. Or heck, why I should be in my life, sleeping is sooo much better.

As if that wasn't bad enough today while setting up for Christmas (which I hate) I kicked a Hawaiian Santa out of my way which then got me hit upside the head which I responded to by kicking a tote ending up getting me sent to my room. Then, on the way to my room, I fell rolling my ankle pretty bad in the process. I push my brother away while laying on my back because I need room to which he calls me a fat ass and locks himself in his room (where he and his gf are) which isn't allowed so I kick the door open and he curses at me and pulls a knife on me. At this point my dad steps in fixes his door frame (I fucked it up) and pushes me past to my room where I then proceeded to sleep until about 8 at night. But before I fell asleep I couldn't help but see how much of a pos I am and also had my brothers words of ""why don't you just kick him out already?"" Playing through my head. I can't help but feel it's better if I am gone but to where?

For anyone who read that I'm sorry but I need to vent and there's no one I can do that to with this. (only person I could vent to cares too much)",1
Should you “announce” your depression to a potential partner?,"Depression is something I’ve struggled with since childhood, and unfortunately I do feel like like it takes up a huge part of my identity. Now at 24 after medication, I do feel like my depressive episodes are under control and I’m getting some sort of life back, hence how this is my first time ever dating someone. 
Even today I feel like depression takes a big chunk of my life and I’m always trying to manage it. Sometimes some topics come up with my date and i feel like I have no answer because I was depressed for a very long time in my life. 
My depression used to be severe enough that I had no interest in activities or socializing, my date asks me about activities I enjoy or about my social life sometimes and I don’t have an answer because it’s all new to me.  

Which brings me to the main question, Is it okay to open up to someone new about depression? A part of me wants to be very clear from the start and say that honestly my life was deeply affected by it before and thats why I’m the way I am. But then another part of me says don’t expose your personal issues to anyone especially if they’re new. Any advice?",1
IDK anymore,I've wanted to kill myself everyday for the past 15 years. even on days that i'm happy my depression is in the back of my head gnawing at me. i'm so tired of not being ok. all i've wanted in life is just to feel ok. not amazing. not good. not even slightly positive. i just want to know what neutral feels like at least. i hate myself so much that even if i did try to change for the hundredth  time and it worked what would even be the point? i'm already 27 and obese since 10. my life is pretty much half over with the way i've treated myself and i'm too broke to afford any healthcare that could change that. ive got bloodclots in my lung that flair in pain anytime i try to exercise and it just kills my motivation. even if i lost the weight what would change? the bloodclots are a hereditary condition and ill be fighting them for the rest of my life even if i change. i want to kill myself and just end it all but i don't even have enough money in my bank account to cover my own cremation. not only would i destroy the very few people that care about me. but i would financially ruin them for at least a year. it hurts so bad to even think about it. it just seems like its all hopeless. this is the first reddit post i've ever made and i'm coming here because everywhere else just treats you like you're crazy for thinking this could even be an option. they act like you're selfish. what is selfish about ending my own existence witch has no point?  i cant be happy without immediately getting depressed in my own head and having to cover it with a fake smile. i have no skills that are exceptional. i have no friends. i have very limited family that even cares that i exist and im pretty sure they only care because they made my life hell as a kid. i cant stand the lack of common decency and social respect in the world. i cant stand that everyone judges me without judging themselves first. im in my mid twenties and im broke even though i work all the time. my car had a random electrical fire that totaled it right after my insurance lapsed. i dont know how to even proceed anymore. it seems so hopeless. i spent so long trying to be a good person and it got me nothing. people just walk over kind people. i hate humans so much it makes me sick. idk i had to put this somewhere because i am just lost. i feel like i threw my life away to try to get people to like and respect me only to find out that people only respect benefits. it seems so downhill from here.,1
Do I just hate happiness?,"I think I might just hate happiness. Is this normal?

I've always had a great and supporting family, I've never been given reason to be sad or feel like I shouldn't have a thousand things to be grateful for.

But all I can think about is how the world is such horrible place, and how do any of us deserve to be happy while others aren't?

Christmas is coming up, and aside from when I was a child, excited to get presents etc, I have always hated Christmas. It's just a constant reminder of the fact that other people have so much less than I do, or that others are so much sadder. In a months time we are all suppose to sit around and act so happy and satisfied while there are literally people freezing on the street, children waking up to nothing in poverty or maybe abuse, families being torn apart by war, people sitting in a hospital as they wait for their loved one to die. For someone, somewhere, the 25th December this year will be the worst day of their life. How is that fair?


Went off on a bit of a rant about Christmas, but it's other celebrations of happiness as well.

I dont celebrate my birthday. Aside from feeling uncomfortable at being the centre of attention, I hate celebrating milestones that some people just don't reach. It feels like a tragic reminder, not everyone gets there.

Weddings as well. I'm engaged at the moment, and I just feel all that happiness and emotion feel so forced.

People keep describing this feeling of true happiness around these types of events, but it just doesn't feel like any of it is warranted, deserved or even possible to be true.

Is this normal? Is this imposter syndrome?",1

I started working out, I look good but I don’t feel good. I’ve gone to therapy, I spent hundreds of dollars only for my therapist to say she doesn’t want to see me anymore. I’ve had people come and go in my life and I’ve had friends and family die which makes me feel worse and worse. I’ve never been so alone in my entire life, I have no one to talk to about how I feel, I’ve been single for years and even thought I didn’t feel happy in a relationship I still miss the feeling of being comforted and loved.

My relationship with my wife has deteriorated to nothing. My relationship with my other kids have also suffered. I have nightmares every night about horrible things my wife said to me about a year ago as well as regular ptsd things from work and the death of my son. I stress non stop about finances and what a mess my life has become. 

I've tried therapy. I hate talking to a stranger about my problems, and when I've tried talking to the few friends I have I always feel like my problems are my own and they must think I'm stupid. 

I've tried meds and I hated them. They just made me feel nothing which was somehow worse. Not to mention the weight gain and other side effects which were great for morale. 

At this point I feel incapable of happiness and don't exactly know how much more of this life I can handle.

Hi. I’m ziggy, recently I made a post to this sub Reddit about how I was planning to take my life, and I just saw my family for the last time. Well I talked to my boyfriend about everything. He’s going on a trip right  so won’t be able to see me or message me until January. So before we said goodbye I told him about my plans, I felt it was wrong for him to just never hear from me again. (My parents don’t know about him, so if I died he wouldn’t end up at the funeral..) I told him some of the things that have happened to me in my past, and how people have hurt me. He told me that he used to go through problems with his family so he understands, and how things would get better. He’s told me that before, everybody’s told me that before so I wasn’t really convinced. But then he asked why I wanted to end my life, and I really opened up to him. We talked for an hour or two and he convinced me to at least wait until he’s back from his trip. That means o have at least another month, but after opening up to him it felt like I had something worth living for. I no longer feel the need to stop living. Iv not really religious anymore but I feel like he was sent by something bigger then all of this. I feel like he’s my hope in everything getting better. He’s my hope and he’s proved I can still love. He’s proved I’m not broken, I’m just a little messed up. It feels like he’s but a bandaid over my heart, it doesn’t heal the wound but it provides comfort and stopped any further pain. I love him so much, and before that talk I was so scared of losing him. But then he exspressed how he’s scared to lose me. I have self worth now, and I have someone I love more than anything. He is my everything. “I can fix him.” Wasn’t true, but he could fix me. And for that I’ll never leave him.",1

Every day life is just trauma and people being obsessed with money F(29),"I'm tired of being sad but I'm constantly surrounded by people who are traumatized by life and obsessed with money. Relatives physically fighting each other about money, someone always dying or having to be hospitalized or sick. No one has ever been happy ever unless they talk about something looking good or getting money. Growing up, I was surrounded by a lot of snobby people who were obsessed with grades and friend groups who were all hell vent in being in dysfunctional relationships and looking good while all struggling with health issues and body image issues. Every day life is so ghetto and miserable, everyone is scrounging for money, and dealing with toxic relationships left and right. Can't look vulnerable or ask for help in anything ever. It's not like imlove in the ghetto either, I've loved int he suburbs modt of my life and still deslr with the same energy. Friends in school only liked me when I was pretty and passive, never talk about my feelings or how my day was even. If I looked like I was either unhappy and sad or even proud of myself for something and looked like I was progressing in it I was always out down and shit down. I realize how I think it was a jealousy thing, people.pjrring me down thinking I was perfect but I was far from it. It pissed me off when one of my friends in school faked cancer and even hospital visits and cutting her own hair to make it look real was babies all the time while I was seen as a bitch when I saw right through the act and paid no sympathy. Then they found out it was fake and I was like I told you so. I call people out on their shit and they get mad, then I'm quiet and keep to myself and still targeted like ""oh why don't you want to marry, go to college, etc."" when I know the campus was full of kids with fucked up home lives and relationships doing reckless shit and I was seen as the outsider for not partaking in it and doing my own thing, but then I'm criticized for spending my time and money in doing things I like. I always felt compared to people who are barely doing anything in their lives. A girl I dated told me she didn't believe in love until she found me and said I was more affectionate than her exes that gave her herpes and trauma then all of a sudden says because I didn't text her multiple times daily that I didn't love her and because I said i wanted to use protection when we had sex and I wouldn't risk herpes for her. Past people I've dated also said I wasn't affectionate but then vent to me about their toxic exes ruining their lives and idk if because I don't argue with them and actually like a peaceful relationship that doesn't excite them enough to want to stay with me. It's just odd, I'm a woman too and very feminine but I always attract chaotic energy and it's just exhausting every day is a fight. I'm safest in being a recluse and it makes me so sad when I turned 18 I wanted to break away from my controlling toxic home and do beautiful things but this world is so shit, tho it's easier with family now. Even the internet is so cracked, common sense seemed to end when COVID did and now the world went through shit. I miss the days I would just draw in my room while listening to music alone and daydream of an elsewhere.

how can i get better?,"ive been depressed for a very long time. my first suicidal thought (as told by my mother so im not sure if its true but i dont know why it wouldnt be) was when i was around 4 years old after a loved one passed away, i had told her that i was going to take my own life and although it could have been just a kid being dramatic it is also possible i was just very distraught. from then on i didnt have a great social life, i never had friends in school. home life was just ok, not great not horrible. around middle school it definitely got worse and high school was when i was at my worst. i ended up dropping out very very early (15) and i never went back to school. i tried alternative schools but i also have anxiety and so it was super overwhelming. ive never attempted to take my life and even though ive thought of it i never ever wanted to die because even though im depressed i do have a lot of hopes and i do see a future for myself but its so incredibly hard to do anything at all. a lot of my depression manifests itself in just having a severe lack of energy and motivation and it really holds me back from everything that i want to do. i dont have great hygiene because i genuinely cannot even sit up in bed most days, i starve myself because i dont want to get out of bed, i dont bathe unless i feel as if my skin is caked in dirt (its not but it feels like it) is there any way that i can get my motivation up? i cant just THINK of things to motivate me (such as my aspirations as it doesnt do the trick) and i wanted to know if anyone has any idea what i could do. i have been on quite a few different medications but all of them had zero effect (no negative or positive effects) so im not sure where to go from there besides my doctor just giving me a different pill each 3 months to see if it will work finally. i just really need motivation, it sometimes gets so bad that i cant even turn over into a different position in bed no matter how much i try and yell at myself in my head to move.

This is a very important year that will determine my entire future and which college I'll get into—anxiety is killing me and I can't stand that anymore. I've lately tried ending my life several times and I've yet to find a peaceful, method to end it.

I FEEL SO USELESS,"Title.

I'm 18 (f) and I think I'm just done. I don't know, but it's like everything I do is super embarrassing. 

I try to wear nice outfits, dress nicely, buy makeup, and look presentable, but I just end up looking disgusting.

I don't even know if I can keep on anymore. 

I tried doing things to help other people.

For example, I did write a letter to an incarcerated person (not a bad crime) because I wanted to provide some friendship. I think I just ended up embarrassing myself even more, and looking back on the letter, I realized that it sounds super cringey and honestly dumb.

Like why am I even here? Just to keep on being a failure? What's the point? No one actually likes me.

My brother left again for college without saying goodbye to me. Granted, I did take a couple of verbal jabs at him. Whenever I complain about my problems, he always - along with the rest of my family - tells me that ""Nobody cares."" And that really hurts my feelings! I know no one cares about me, but I just want some validation. I want to feel like I matter.

I try to be optimistic and tell other people that it's going to be alright, all while I suffer and drown in my own despair. 

I think a lot of my depression stems from wanting to feel validated. When I had ""friends"" in high school, they all had boyfriends and everything. And a nice family. And I always wanted that. I don't think I deserve that. I don't know where I'm going with this. This is already too long.

I don’t know why I feel what I feel so I try to find control. To make sure it is my body by making it bleed. Watching it. It’s depressing. I recently got prescribed new depression meds that is specifically made for those who suffer MDD which I recently got diagnosed with. What do I even do anymore? I feel like I can never run away from this. Why couldn’t I just never be traumatized and mistreated my entire life and end up with shitty coping mechanisms that people who don’t have my mental illness don’t understand that I wish it was easy to “just stop doing it” “stop thinking those thoughts” “try to be more positive in life” “you’re only like this because you choose to be unhappy and choose to have this”. If I knew it was a choice I sure as hell wouldn’t have chosen this.,1

Ugh,"I have school in a few hours. It’s 12:30 AM as i’m typing this. 


It was Thanksgiving break and I felt relaxed. I wasn’t happy. I just stayed in the house the entire week. I was finally away from school. And now I have to go back. 

Honestly, i’m tired of trying to maintain my grades and giving a damn about them. Because of that, I don’t even want to go to college, which, I know my family will disown me for. 


I hate this all. I really do. Why is it so much easier for people to “snap out of it?” Why do people make it seem easy? As immature and irresponsible my brother is, he still has hopes and dreams and would never end his life over anything. My mom too. They can snap out of it and keep going. I can’t. I don’t even want to snap out of it because people make it seem so easy and I find it embarrassing for me to make “getting better” so hard for myself. I should snap out if it. But, I can’t, and I’m almost done trying",1

Treatment-Resistant: What now?,"(29F) I’ve struggled with treatment resistant depression, OCD, and GAD my entire life. In my early 20s I experienced a relationship and a death that left me with PTSD and complicated/traumatic grief.

After over 15 years of unsuccessful medication and therapy combos, I recently completed almost 50 sessions of TMS. While I do think the TMS vastly improved my depression symptoms, I am still depressed. My question is what do I do now? Is this just life now? Depressed but not suicidal? What do I do?

I am still so sad, but the TMS helped me get back to a functioning place and lessened my symptoms so I guess you could say it worked. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do now. I’m still depressed…",1

things I should do before seeing a counselor,"I 19F is thinking ab seeing a counselor/psychiatrist at my college and was wondering how I can make the appointment effective?

reason: the last time I saw a counselor at my college did not go well, in the sense that I felt like it didn't do anything to help me. ik the counselor was an intern and I feel like most of the session was spent ""feeling bad"" for me.",1

throwaway bc I feel so dumb for even feeling this way.

I don’t have friends, my family think I’m annoying, I hate myself now because of my damages. And I want to actually die as sad as that sounds. When I was younger I wanted to do things but my parents would never let me, it caused me to miss out on things in life so I became isolated. Turning 18 they wanted me to do everything but I no longer had a reason to do them. I get a job for what? Money ok..? Then what do I buy? Nothing because I have no life.

It's the worst when it's dark at night like around this time (10pm) because I'm alone at home. I wish I had someone to talk to :(

I feel like death isn't so bad and I've been thinking that I don't know if I want to be here anymore. Like I don't give a shit about anything. It feels like my life is just a massive drag. And I have no purpose or meaning, I just feel like I'm living for the sake of living. Nothing makes sense. Life is just hopeless. I have no friends or family and everything is wrong. I'm so alone.

"Hey, this is my first time trying to talk about how i feel. I am in desperate need of help.","I am 29 studying a master degree, have a job and a girlfriend and i have what we call a good life.
I have been dealing with psychological issues since 2018, but i managed to keep the most part of it under control, or so i thought.
For a couple of months ago, i started to feel really down, like never was before. The feeling became heavier and heavier, and i felt that my head and my body were really overwhelmed almost the whole time. I was in a stressful period of time before it started, but i had a lot of stressful periods in my life and never felt as heavy is it was this time.
The thing that is really ruining my life is a strange feeling in my chest, near the heart. It’s not like a physical pain, but much worse. I have never found the right words to describe it but i will try. It’s like a heavy emptiness, with something boiling inside of it, and it makes me feel every heart beat like it’s beating harder that normal, even though the pulse is normal. This feeling can stay for days continuously. Sometimes I don’t know if it’s in my chest, my stomach or my throat. It can be trigged by nothing and anything, and it occurs by itself most of the times. It makes me really down, fearful, anxious, demotivated and depressed.
I have regular meetings with psychologist, and going to see a psychiatrist in a couple of months.
What is this that i am feeling? I would listen to any advice :)",1
Scared of relapsing,"Idk if relapsing is the right word. Like, not on drugs, but I'm scared of being depressed again.

I was incredibly depressed for years. It honestly almost killed me - I was miserable, it was painful, and I finally, finally after years found my way out. The thing is though - now I'm terrified of being that depressed again. I don't even know if I could do it again, and I'm scared of feeling that way again. The thing is, I avoid doing hard things because I worry that it could send me back into depression. Like, I worry if I take a risk - move across the country, or even have a tough conversation with a friend - and something goes wrong it'll plunge me back into that. I feel like I'm more emotionally fragile than other people, who can encounter situations that make them sad without it threatening to completely send them into years of horrible depression. And I'm avoiding things that really could make me a better person because I'm scared of this - I'm just taking the easy way out because it feels good, when I know that if I took risks it could really help me in life. But I just feel like I can't do the depression thing again. Any advice? I would really appreciate it. Thank you :)",1
My boyfriend laughed at me when he found me in a bad state,"I’m 25 he’s 31. I’ve been acutely declining. Today I obsessively searched for Reddit posts and YouTube news about women ending their lives just so I can relate to something. I’m hiding in a closet because I want to cry and be alone but he opened the closet door just to laugh at me, ask if I want some of his food and then sarcastically ask if i want him to shut the door. He shut the door and went back to doing his own thing. I don’t want his attention, I haven’t been speaking to him, i ignore him most of the time and I’ve become clearly apathetic and rude to him because I want to be alone. I just wish he didn’t make fun of me. I truly just want to be alone and ignored. He didn’t have to laugh at me and make fun of me.

Reaching a breaking point,"For a while I thought I wanted to kill myself, but after further reflection, I don't think that to be the case any longer. It's difficult to pin down what I want, exactly. As of writing this, it's 7:20 p.m. on a Sunday. My mother is out working and my sister is asleep in her bedroom, and I've spent my day the way I spend most days. I've been scouring the internet looking for anything sufficient to distract myself from my current situation. As it stands, I am unemployed, and have been for an embarrassing length of time. I have a dwindling pool of friends, and I'm not too confident the ones that are left like me all too much. I pace frantically between every room in the house, listening to music while I imagine a better life. One where I have friends, a job, a girlfriend or boyfriend, where maybe I can be happy. I don't want to die, but I find myself unable to live. It's been months since I haven't thought about killing myself, but that would be a concession, and an admission that I can't live the life I'd like to, and what a tragedy that would be. No, that's far too depressing an ending for me. The thought crosses my mind occasionally that maybe I don't deserve the life I want, to be happy, or to be loved, but that's irrelevant. In the real world, people don't get what they deserve. All that's worth having must be taken, and at this point I couldn't care less if I deserve it or not. I want it, and I'll have it.",1
Everything is terrible,"I’ve had these moments since I’ve been out of the hospital where I’ll think that I’m doing better but then part of me thinks that I’m wrong, to where I’ll begin to sense impending doom, like like a mental crash or a breakdown is bound to happen. Maybe that’s making me more susceptible? Or maybe it’s some cruel joke by the universe to actively be making things worse hoping I’ll crack. 

I can go out and have a fine day but I’ll look at myself in the mirror and feel disgusted with my appearance and it’ll ruin my mood. Or I’ll suddenly be reminded of a traumatic experience and I’ll want to die. Or, more recently, where people are constantly saying or doing things to me that make me feel completely awful, as though there’s something wrong with me based on how I speak or think or go about things. Do I deserve to be belittled? Insulted? Over something as minor as not wanting to order my food at a drive thru when I’m on the passenger side? And what I say doesn’t matter. 

I’m so accustomed to feeling miserable and worthless this past year that less and less affects me. But then when something does it just throws me off. So why now? When I thought I was a bit better?
Was I just ignoring things before?
Was I really doing doing better when I couldn’t even get myself to brush my teeth regularly again? 

I don’t even know what regular people are supposed to feel like so sometimes it seems like a sham to me. Even reading this feels like a whole lot of nothing and that I’m a worthless person since I can’t articulate or even be bothered to do basic tasks. I just keep thinking of trying yo drink myself or drug myself but it’s such a fruitless effort since I know it won’t work and nothing will change. ",1
I don't know if it gets better,"There are moments of fleeting joy. Most of the time, you are in despair. Like you are gasping for air and can't take a full breath. I don't know if it gets better but you have to find something to hold on to. You have to fight every day. It gets tiring and I wouldn't blame anyone if they felt they couldn't fight anymore. Sometimes, I feel like I'm on my last leg and then I start over again. ",1
how to handle episodes in college,"I was diagnosed with severe MDD a few years ago after experiencing symptoms for most of my teenage years, and now typically have one major 2-3 month episode per year with some smaller rough patches in between. Most of the advice I've found online for continuing ""life as normal"" while heavily depressed tells me to... not do that. The general consensus seems to be to just hunker down and ride it out (something I'm a pro at by now).

Problem is, I'm in now my senior year of college -- I can't just pause my life for a few months until I'm well enough to exist again. I flunked all of my classes and almost got kicked out in my second year, but now that I'm set to graduate, I REALLY can't afford to do that again (I'm on a time-limited scholarship and getting loans to cover the rest has been excruciatingly difficult as is). As it stands I'm missing several major assignments, haven't started any final projects, and haven't gone to class in... a while. My professors seem to be pretty understanding and have given me extensions to try to get the work done, but that leniency can only go so far and I REALLY feel these external things spiraling out of control again.

I can't afford to see a therapist or psych right now (lost my last job due to... you guessed it, depression); I'll see my primary care doc in January and he can up my existing meds but that's about it.

I know I'm ""getting bad"" again. Usually this happens in spring or summer when I can just veg out in the a/c and watch tv all day, but that's not gonna fly this time. How can I protect the life I've built for myself when I'm too depressed to perform basic functions?",1
Seasonal Depression,I want to end my life. Or maybe I just don’t want to exist anymore. I’m not sure. All I know is the closer it gets to Christmas the more I think this might be the year I kill my self.,1
Nobody will ever want me and I'll never get better.,"I don't even know where to start. Usually when I try to come out with my issues the entire app crashes or whatever I'm writing gets deleted like god or something really loves to fuck me in the ass and make me feel pain.

I've had depression for years. Since childhood. Then I got really sick in my teens and have stayed sick into my adulthood. It started with food poisoning and grew into mold and other horrific pain and symptoms that I went to the ER for hundreds of times over ten years. 

I've lost everything. My house. My job. My dignity. My family. My friends. My self respect. Any hope. I don't know how I'm still alive. I have put a gun to my head so many times it's ridiculous. What I've been through, I should not be sane, or alive at this point. Somehow I'm still here, and I hate every single second if it. I don't know what to do about it. 

From the moment I wake to the moment I try to fall asleep I am in constant pain physically, emotionally, and mentally. And fuck it, if there's a spirit. That too.

I'm poor. I'm alone. I'm useless. I have no skills. I have no value. And I'm a fucking coward who can't kill himself. So I'm stuck on this planet enduring more and more pain because there IS NO WAY OUT for me. There's no avenue to take. Pills, medications, diets, fads, therapies, exercise, meditation, books, praying, gods, other human beings. There is absolutely NOTHING on this fucking planet for me. I don't know why I'm here. 

The only thing I can think of is that I'm paying for something horrible I did in a past life. Maybe I was Hitler. Maybe I raped babies. I don't fucking know. What's the worst thing imaginable a human being can do. That's what I'm paying for. That's everything I've felt every day while I've been alive. Pain for no reason. And nobody gives a fuck. This is hell for me. 

I pray for an early death. A death that comes in my sleep so I get one gift while on this Earth. A death that is peaceful. I will never understand how what was done to me was okay in the eyes of any Creator. That Creator has never known pain. 

And I'm lost. My I'm bitching, relentlessly, about something that can never be fixed. My brain is fucked. My body is fucked. And I've been left here to rot and die because I offer no value to the human race. This is beyond evil. 

Anyway. That's my story so far. K bye.",1

Recently diagnosed?,"17F, Ive gone through a couple of counselors/therapists over the past couple of years for suicidal ideation. Recently my mom told me some of my counselors had diagnosed me with depression, which I was never told of. I’m not sure how to feel bc I’ve been suspecting something was wrong for a while (obviously bc of the suicidal junk) but also kept being paranoid I was making up a mental illness on purpose for attention (ever since I was a preteen I romanticized mental illness and explicitly wanted to be depressed/suicidal). I was also obsessed over getting a diagnosis for something but this felt underwhelming; maybe I thought depression was too “boring” of an illness?? As if I needed to be more interesting????  
I’m going to go to a psychiatrist to talk about taking meds, but I’m still unsure if I’m actually depressed or not. I just keep getting these mood swings that only last a couple hours before feeling fine, if not better. I always got a good score on the depression screenings I’ve done at annual check ups at the doctor (except for the suicidal part). Lately my work ethic has gone down the drain and I don’t care for things as much so I hope I don’t kill myself before I maybe get better from whatever this is.",1

I just feel empty all the time, on the urge of crying but I never can and I have to go college now but it feels like an impossible challenge to do so. My attendance is rapidly dropping and I'm just failing at everything in my life.

My story,"I (15 F) have been struggling with depression since I was a toddler and had my first suicide attempt when I was 10y/o, started self-harm when I was 12y/o, diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety at 13y/o. assaulted at 14y/o.
I started working with a social worker also at 12 y/o for a year and a half. I confided in my doctor about my SH and SI (suicidal ideation) and they recommended me to outpatient therapy which i did for 3-4 months. During that time, I found another therapist who literally made me sob into my moms arms on the first day, but I stuck with her for a few months and then she really started to weird me out so I asked my parents if I can switch therapists and they agreed. I started seeing a different therapist for over a year and she was not helpful for me. I decided I needed one last try, and I found my current therapist who is very helpful, supportive of my interests, and is very sweet. 
I’m on two different medications, one of which is a booster for the other. 

Current: I have a few friends who are pretty inconsistent with the way they treat me. I do not have a significant other and don’t plan to for a while. I get treated badly at school. I get stared at, I’m given dirty looks, I’m called names, talked about, and kind of like the schools joke. I try my best to fit in but nobody allows me to move on from my mistakes—mostly my mistakes in middle school. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just know that i don’t like my life and would rather not be here than live it. I have a few ways of coping: music, singing, and art. I try to do these things as often as I can, as well as things I learned in outpatient. My friends make it somewhat better, but I don’t know what to do with my life socially.",1
Advice needed,"Hi I have been struggling with depression for the past few years and last night decided to test a plan (an option for ending my life) to see if it would work (it didn't).

I wish I would have died in my car accident,"I have ALWAYS struggled with depression since childhood. I'm 23. I thought I'd be done with this anon account after a couple posts but guess not. This year, I had a mental breakdown after catching covid and quit my shitty retail job in June. I have been receiving treatment through therapy and im constantly trying new meds, but nothing works, and what will is illegal here. 

I had a terrifying car accident in July. Was going 60 on the highway when my tires locked up. Spun out into the guard rail. Thought I was going to die and felt my body give up. Well guess what? It was such a lucky accident. I was the only car affected on a full highway. 20ft or so forward and no more guard rail, I would have gone into the other lane or flipped. Despite my airbag not deploying, I walked out of a totalled car with only bruises, scrapes, and a mild concussion. 

I wish I would have died then. It's November, almost December. I can't hold down a full time job without losing my insurance or having a breakdown. I don't have a car to go to work. The money i got from totalling won't buy me half a working car. I keep applying to places and no one calls, and I'm tired of having eyes rolled at me because I don't want to go into big box store retail or fast food. I haven't been able to get my meds for two weeks because the pharmacy and my provider keep playing chicken to see who can fuck up the most. This is the second consecutive time this has happened! I dont even know why im upset because EVEN WHEN IM ON THE MEDS IM EITHER MORE NUMB OR WORSE OFF. 

I live at home. I can't give my family a Christmas they deserve this year, let alone pay them rent they deserve. I'm a deadbeat, I have no partner, no college degree, no opportunities to leave this shitty state that's actively fighting against my right to live. I don't know how to make myself see past it all right now. Seeing my family at Thanksgiving just made me feel like more of a loser because those people have gone through war, loss, and actual problems. And I'm just sitting here wishing I wasn't when they're all strong and able to be here in spite of everything they've gone through. And I put in all the work to develop coping skills and keep up with my therapist's suggestions, but I always end up at another breakdown. I feel like I'm failing her too.",1

Depressions relapse over the last few months,"I have been experiencing episodes of depression over the last 3 months. It started when I quit my last job and had been unemployed for about 2 months. The Whole job hunting process, with the rejections and slow application processes had gotten me down. I eventually got a job at a really good company, doing something I had always wanted to do. But the depression just got worse when I started work. The first month at work I could barely function and was fully forcing myself to socialise and network when all I wanted to do was curl into a ball and go home and cry. 

Eventually I got more comfortable at my new job and I slowly started to come out of the depression. But over the last 2 weeks I noticed that there were days where I could feel the depression creeping back. And yesterday, it just all fell apart. 

I'd taken a short staycation with my parter. We were in the room pretty much the whole day. Just chilling and watching movies. As night started to fall I was overcome with this terrible, sinking feeling in my chest. The walls started to look grey, the noise from the air conditioner started to sound different. It was like some ominous scene from a psycho-thriller and all I wanted to do was go home and curl up into a ball. 

As soon as I got home I cried, I had a panic attack and was just inconsolable. This morning I feel even worse, I couldn't even bring myself to take a shower. I just forced myself out of bed and into my work clothes and went about my regular commute. Now I'm sitting at my desk, wanting to go home and curl up into a ball. 

How do I overcome this? I've been seeing a therapist but not consistently. I don't know how to be more consistent about this. 

And more importantly, I don't know if I should tell my partner about my depression. They know I've been going through something but they're not aware of the full extent of it. I'm scared this will ruin our relationship.

I appreciate any help an guidance I can get.",1

I've been bullied since 2nd fucking grade, I've been dealing with BED since I was 7. I'm 13 now, and it's just gotten much worse. My dad is narcissistic, and puts everyone down besides himself. My mom is actually nice, but seems oblivious to what I'm going through. I don't keep in touch with my older brother, and my older sister can't really help due to her jobs. Social media, friends, and sports are probably the only things that keep me happy in life anymore. Even then, I've been exposed to horrible parts of the fucking internet, especially here on reddit. I was traumatized for life here after what seemed to be a cool edit, turned into a livestreamed fucking suicide. I still can see it in my head to this day, and I was exposed to it 4 fucking months ago. I cut for about 3 months, but never very deep. I cut just a little bit so that there was a clear mark there. I cut with a very sharp set of tweezers, since I didn't have access to any blades. And when a friend asked about it, I just lied and said it was my dog. I can barely take this shit anymore. I don't want to end my life but, I don't really know anymore. I've helped others get over depression but, I feel like that's what started this fucking shit for me. I try to be nice, even with my anger issues, but all I get back are insults and punches. I don't know what to fucking do anymore. I need help.",1
I’m seriously considering ending my life.,"Its so exhausting to live with this sinking feeling, i quite literally feel like i’m physically drowning all the time. You know what the most ironical part is? I’m a therapist. Day in and day out i help my clients feel better, try to be the empathetic and kind person they need in their life, and so many of them have reported progress over the years and continue to do so, but the most ironical part is i can’t help myself. I’ve tried meds it did not help. I just.. i don’t find the will in me to continue, i am exhausted and depressed and i want to end it all.",1
Can't figure out why I feel the need to complete a checklist before I kill myself after graduating from college?,"In 2019, I attempted suicide after I graduated high school. Now, I am about to graduate college this December with a bachelor's of science in computer science. I have decided I'm going to kill myself sometime after I graduate. I'm declined to go to my graduation ceremony earlier this semester berceuse I originally wanted to kill myself when I get back home from college. However, I do not feel complete yet. For some reason, I refuse to kill myself until I complete a few tasks. I made a check list of things I wanted to do before I kill myself.  


Here is some of the things on my to-do list before I die:  
\- Graduate college with a CS degree  
\- Clean my bedroom & bathroom at home  
\- Delete my social media accounts  
\- Organize all my personal files on my computer  
\- Clean out my truck  
\- Play video games with my friends  
\- Go out to eat with my family  
\- Have a BBQ with my close friends  
\- Have one last drink with my best friend  


I will admit there are some things I would like to do before I die. However, some of these actions I'm considering will only keep my alive longer. For example, I'm a 22 year-old male and I'm still a virgin. I pretty much lied to all my friends about not being a virgin. This is because I didn't want them to know because my friends assume I can get women. I work out at the gym a lot and I also like doing stand up comedy in my free time. I have never had issues talking to women but my depression keeps me from making a move. In the end, I always ended up jerking off to porn or something. This has led me down a very addictive path with porn but that's something I don't feel like going into in this post. I have never romantically held a women's hand. I do have female friends but I've always been afraid of persuading a relationship because I always knew I would kill myself eventually. The thing is I've planned on killing myself sometime after I graduate college. So I always told myself, ""What's the point of getting a girlfriend if you are just going to break her heart by killing yourself later?"" I did accept a job offer in October but it doesn't matter because I don't want to be alive anymore. A couple days after my first suicide attempt in 2019, I made a promise I was going to finish college and that my life would be better. Now, I realized I only gave myself more time of battling my depression. Sometime during my sophomore year of college, I told myself I would only be allowed to kill myself after I graduate with a degree. My parents paid for all my college expenses, so I would feel bad for not finishing out my degree. I just turned 22 years old and I'm still angry that I survived my first suicide attempt when I was 18 years old. I woke up angry thinking I was such a loser that I couldn't even commit suicide properly. Sometimes, I keep thinking myself, ""I wouldn't be suffering right now if I would have just died that day after my last day of high school..."". All my friends and siblings had dreams of going to college and getting their dream job. My dream was to not be alive. I'm honestly surprised I've managed to stay alive this long. I just don't understand why I refuse to let myself die until I complete all of these tasks I've given myself. I haven't even wrote any suicide letters for family and friends. I do take daily anti depressants and do weekly therapy appointments. I haven't reached out to any friends and family about this because I don't want to be talked out of it when the time finally comes. Sometimes, I just want to kill myself right away but I have this annoying voice telling me to do these things before I'm allowed to kill myself. I know that my sudden death will cause pain to my friends and family. I really hate that I'm going to cause grievance to all my friends and family. The thing is I know I won't be here to see it happen. I know it's selfish but I'm just looking forward to finally end this pain.",1
Going insane hi,My brain is fucked up I wish I wasn’t born,1
There’s too many of us,"


I’m scared there’s too many people to save before I can get any help. Just scrolling on Reddit…any social media app, really, there’s hundreds and thousands of people with shittier lives than mine, all begging for help to not kill themselves. 

It’s like a sea of severely depressed people and im just a drop in it. We’re so fucked. There’s too many people to help and not enough saviors. Why should I yell out for a life preserver when everyone else is screaming for rescue around me? It seems like half the country is suicidal. I feel like there’s no hope for any of us. 

I have a therapist, I’ve told him all of this but it’s been two months and I still don’t feel better. I’m scared nobody is going to come and save me, I’m going to have to pull myself out of this depression. I’m not strong enough anymore.

I have to get through this week. Then again. Again. Again

I’m really sorry if this sounds whiny",1
My Sobriety is Worse than My Addiction,"I actually haven’t been doing too terribly. After being homeless on the streets with no food or water for nearly a week, while also detoxing from a terrible Xanax addiction that I stopped cold turkey and getting shipped to and from California; I finally have somewhat of a home and I’m back with the person I’ve been calling my soulmate for years. 

I’m currently clean of all drugs which is really hard for me since I use them to cope with my depression, anxiety, etc. But things are getting tough. My partner and I aren’t doing great financially but because of this I feel like we should both be working equally to achieve our financial needs. 

I’m already stressed since when I moved in, I was expected to help with rent which was already behind. I don’t really mind the expectation since I’m living here now but it brought a lot of stress beings I came into the household after being homeless with no job. 

Ontop of this, our household isn’t doing great with affording food or household essentials. In the past few weeks I’ve used nearly every dollar I’ve had toward either helping with rent or helping with food/essentials. 

I now can no longer pay for groceries, essentials, rent, my phone bill, my partner’s pet food, or even substances to cover it all up. This is the hardest part for me. Usually I’d atleast spark up a cheap cigarette to take the edge off but I can’t.

When I was an addict I maintained a well paying management job, I took my significant other out on dates, I was genuinely happy. Now that I’m sober I can’t find a job, I can’t make my partner happy (it seems), and I’m losing motivation to even try.

The old me would just turn to SH but it puts a lot of stress on my partner. With my partner being all that I have left to keep me motivated, I don’t know what to do with myself. I have such a disgusting taste toward myself that I can’t seem to get past. These stressors seem to never fade and honestly I feel like it’s all going to end up killing me the longer I hold it in.",1
My life is a lie,"I guess I should start with I just recently graduated from high school and I’m taking a year off to work and have money to go to university next year. Im already set to go to school September 2024 but I really don’t know what I want to do yet. Im living at home working at a swimming pool as a life guard I also don’t enjoy either of those things I want my own space away from my parents and my job sucks I’ve been there since my last year of high school and I’ve been full time for a month now. My co-workers all clown on me as im the only full time staff member besides my three childish supervisors. My coworkers are between the age of 16-22 and they make my life a living hell I don’t get along with many off them and it’s really awkward to be around a few of them as I have outside of work issues with them. To make matters worse my supervisors are obsessed with high school and young adult drama and there all in there 30s. Once I’ve caught them talking about how I’m terrible at my job and they hate me because I’m a male also there’s only 3 males and 22 females on the staff so it’s very sexist at time. 



Sorry for the rant about work I’m moving on now in my personal life I have a lot of spare time on my hands and I’ve been hanging out with my friends a lot and 90% of my friend group is now in a relationship 5 of us were single at the start of this month and now it’s just me and one other. I want a relationship but every time someone try’s to get with me I I don’t like them and when ever I try to get with someone I like they don’t like me back. I feel like I’m stuck in a endless loop right now not knowing how to fix any of my issues. The only things that bring me joy at the moment is sitting down at the end of the night and smoking my weed pen listening to music by myself.",1
Please I don't understand what is wrong!!!,"Hi to anybody reading this.

I need help and I don't know where to turn to because the internet hasn't given me answers. Sorry for my grammar but I really don't care about something so small right now. 

I have always been sort of anxious but I was a happy child. I was also a happy teenager and even though I have never had a girlfriend and I was kinda lonely, I still had friends who cared about me and I was happy. I was so excited for the weekend to play video games or ride bikes with my friends, and I would only get anxious over my health (which is good, I just have hypochondria) or during social situations with new people. To my friends I am extremely talkative, but to my peers I am quiet. I cannot keep stressing how I loved my life though, even though it had some loneliness and longing for more friends.

Then came 2023. I was 20 and I took a math test in February. I did great and I wasn't worried about it, but suddenly later that night at around 10 PM I got flu like symptoms with chills and a fever and crippling anxiety, and it lasted the whole night. It disappeared with the night and I was back to normal for over a month, until my second math test on March 9th, 2023. I was scared I would have the random fever again but not overly scared, and when I went to the test, I started feeling nauseous and I had my first ever panic attack inside the testing room. I did ok and left the test feeling absolutely horrible, and the nausea and crippling anxiety continued on into the night.

Late into the night, I started feeling better and went to bed happy, but I woke up after about 3 hours due to stomach issues, which I assume was caused by anxiety. I was anxious the whole next day and when going to sleep that night, I had my second ever panic attack, which literally made me feel like I was dying. I was so afraid of these sudden events and I didn't know what was going on, and throughout the next week I experienced hell. I am an introvert and I like being alone, but I was unable to be left alone during this period because I was so afraid of literally nothing. There was nothing I was thinking about, I was just constantly shaking and having panic attacks and fearing that this was my new life, that this anxiety was permanent, and that my life was over. I was put on Citalopram, my first ever antidepressant, on March 16th and the anxiety began to fade away over the next month. I wouldn't wish what I went through during that month on my worst enemy, and I don't know whether the citalopram helped me recover or maybe I just calmed down, but I have no idea.

I had a great few months after that but on September 29th it came back. I joined a club that day and it wasn't my type of scene, so I left disappointed, but literally an hour later I was back on the club page looking for more clubs to join, so I obviously wasn't depressed or anything. At around 10PM that night though, the crippling anxiety from March 9th came back out of nowhere, and I couldn't finish my lucky charms due to the sudden nausea return. Throughout the next 3 days, the anxiety's physical symptoms all came back, and I instantly lost all of my interests and desires. All I cared about was getting better again, and I wanted to figure out why this anxiety was back.

Over the week that followed anxiety became anxiety + depression, and I began to think that if this continued, I don't want to live. Nothing got better and on October 10th, 2023, I was admitted to the ER for suicidal thoughts, which I had never had before that point. We upped my citalopram to 30mg and started wellbutrin but it didn't work, and I had to go off the wellbutrin about 5 weeks in. It's now almost been two months and my life is hell. I haven't played video games in 2 months, I haven't hung out with my friends in 2 months, I want to cry all the time, I am hopeless, I started reading the Bible and I now pray to God every night, and I want this nightmare to end, but I am a pessimist, so I am having trouble believing it will get better without seeing results. 

Please they have checked my blood, its fine but my prolactin is 23 which is a bit high. They did an MRI and it's fine, no pituitary tumor, no tumors period, and I am so scared, hopeless, and sad. They tested testosterone, prolactin, cbc, metabolic panel, cortisol, 24 hour pee test, stool test for H pylori, magnesium, zinc, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and I just don't understand. What happened to me in such a short time, why can't I recover, and how do I stop this pain. I am weaning off the citalopram because if there is even 1% of a chance that citalopram caused this depression, I must know. I was taking famotidine for 3 years and I stopped that 2 weeks ago, and I was taking finasteride but i stopped that on october 10th this year. There is no other meds I can cut because I don't take any others except a vitamin D supplement, and I am so scared. 

Did my depression just develop suddenly in the span of a few days or is something physically wrong with me. I literally was praying I had a pituitary tumor because then I would have an explanation for this illness, and I just want my old life back, the life before September 29th. If anybody has any experience or idea what this could be, I am begging for advice. I really hope something is honestly wrong with me because I don't want a non externally caused depression, im so scared of it, because what if it never goes away and my life is over. What if the pain stays and I never feel excited or happy again. Please if anybody has had a similar experience or any advice at all, please help.",1
Am i depressed? help a girl out,"Read my resume and lmk. Im rlly used to downplaying and invalidating my own emotions, because thats what my mom does anyway, but I dont think im being dramatic this time, I think there is something actually wrong. Also tired of googling things and taking depression quizzes.

\- I've felt hopeless and had a life-doesn't-matter attitude for around 2 years. Usually i get like a good few days of being happy and I forget anything was ever wrong, so it took me until early october to realize that i've had this same feeling for 2 years.

\- I think about dying alot, like everyday without fail, sometimes multiple times a day, any chance I get. 

\- I use the idea of death/suicide as like a back up plan, because i might run away by july (18 but strict parents) and i tell myself if it went south i could just kill myself and be over with life.

\- I don't think life is worth living, and i think this everyday, so often that i even say it outloud to friends.

\- Every tiny thing pushes me over the edge, if anything negative happens i immediately think about suicide, and start crying. It's rlly dumb, idk why i do it. 

\- I genuinly think i hate my parents and being at home is such an awful experience for me, i hate weekends and breaks because i know that the whole time, i'll feel depressed and be irritable, also cry a lot. I also don't leave my room except for food and i dont look at my parents when i talk to them and avoid them in general. Everything they do literally grates against all of my nerves at once and they make me feel angry so easily, and that makes me feel depressed.

\- I start crying anytime i see a tiktok of someone with their mom/dad having a good time.

\- I have felt empty and hopeless for a month straight (its usually not this long), it's been so bad that i actually signed up to talk to a school counsellor and i opened up to my friend about feeling suicidal.

\- I feel guilty for everything, for feeling unhappy, for wanting to run away, for wanting to die.

\- I sometimes wish that someone else would gently kill me

\- I wish i was in a coma, or could just lie somewhere forever and float around and not talk to anyone or do anything, just float in a comatose state.

\- I wish i could erase myself from everyones lives (family/friends) and that my parents would forget i ever existed. Also wish someone would just pick my entire existance up and move it far away where i could be alone fully. 

\- I hate myself

So anyway lmk ig if you think im depressed or not bc im not trying to walk into the school counsellors office just to be told that i'm fine and then get embarrassed. ",1
"It has been a very long road. I will continue to have hope, or at least try.","Forgive me but this is going to be a very lengthy post. You can skim some parts if need be.

*I had to split the post within the comment section because it kept saying error..?

I don't even know where to start exactly, but I'll tell you my current condition and explain to you how I got here. I'd like to stay anonymous bc I'm (nor do I think I'll ever) be confident and comfortable to share my experience with anyone.

I'm 23 years young, have a highly sensitive personality, deal with PTSD (maybe even cptsd), have always struggled and continue to deal with severe depression, newly diagnosed HIV person, I believe I'm one of the most kindest people, am gay, black, extremely empathic, and raped/molested from the age of 4 till 10 years old by someone in my family. I think those are the most important things you need to know about me, especially for context. 

My life has always been challenging from ever since I was young. I always knew I was very different from others because of my sexuality, and was constantly trying to discover who I was, much less even being comfortable enough to open up to people. I use to be religious, and because of that I've always painted a bad picture of myself because I truly believed God, Jesus, this universe didn't love me. 

It took me up until the age of 16 to finally open up and try to be comfortable enough to share myself with my friends, family and peers about all of who I am, or believed I was. I began to focus on my spirituality rather than associating myself with my family's religion. I've made alot of discoveries about myself, have the courage to be happy, and have felt like I was finally accepting myself for the first time in my entire life. 

I have a very complicated relationship with my father and after I opened up to him about my sexuality he told me he loved me...but that wasn't all. He told me how I could cleanse my sins by praying to God and convinced me to try and have relationships and sex with women (and I was still very much a virgin). He compared me to pedophiles and compared my sexuality to his adultery..he told me he was cheating on my mother and said that we could overcome our sins together. We argued alot and have always had a rocky relationship. He's never fully accepted me and I think I've sort of had a voice in my head say similar things to me for a very long time. Much to say I lost my faith in our relationship and my religion, it severely depressed me. 

My parents never gave me any dating advice (but they gave my other siblings dating advice and encouragedthem to even bring their partners sometimes) and so I sort of ventured through the dating scene with no sort of father talk about what relationships should look like. I fell head over heels for anyone who even showed me slight affection and I think it's turned men off from dating me..dating now is such a joke to be honest. I always thought something was wrong with me because guys never wanted to stick around, and so I sort of became a serial monagomist. 

My very first real relationship was very toxic, and I was only 19. I met him through an online dating app, and we went on several dates with each other, he was so charming and made me feel so important. Unfortunately thats the only good there ever was. He lied to me about his age (said he was 24, actually 31), was already in a relationship with one of his roomates, and sort of deceived me into a polygamous experience with them. One night when his roomates were all asleep, he took me upstairs and we had sex. It was actually good at first but then it started to hurt alot and I told him to stop because he was becoming really aggressive. He then whispered into my ear and told me no. I told him to wait, and he just kept going really hard. He finally got off and apologized but I felt extremely weird right afterwards and didn't really know how to react. In my head I sort of just didn't think about it and tried to ignore it. Later on through a strange coincidence with a mutual friend, I found out that he actually tried to rape the mutual friend. 

That wasn't the only tragedy, things became really bad in 2022
All in the span of 2 years, I found out or went through some very disturbing and traumatic events:",1

Is this the real me?,"I’ve been on antidepressants for nearly thirty years. Recently my doctor and I agreed to try and half my dosage.

Snapping at everyone, bad tempered miserable and a complete bag of nerves. I should also add I’m currently experiencing quite a lot of stress at work.

I think it's time for me to face the music. (Rant/Thoughts),"Hello Reddit,  
  
This is my first time posting, and it may be a little chaotic and disorganized so please be patient with me. What follows are some of my personal feelings and thoughts that I have never shared with anybody else.  
  
There's a saying that has been running through my head lately. Roughly the saying in English goes: ""Everything catches up to you no matter how fast you run away from it."" And it caught up to me a long time ago, but I'm realizing this now. I'm 26 and I feel like life is passing me by, because of my inability to act upon myself to get better, to take chances, to take risks or anything else of sorts. I’m empty. That sense of nothingness and eternal void is unbearable, yet somewhat comfortable, and the messed-up part about this has been going on for so long, that I don’t remember when the last time was that I felt ‘something’.   
  
There are plenty of things that I should be grateful right now as I’m writing this. I just moved to a different country, I have a significant other (living together), I have family and friends, you name it… It's a funny situation – surrounded by people who care yet feeling alone.  
  
Stagnating in this realm of beating myself over things and paralyzing myself with overthinking led me to believe that I am a failure and boy, do I have the record for it. I still haven’t finished uni, that’s one. I’m dragging this along with me for many years, and I don’t know if I have the mental capacity to study and learn and finish this thing once and forever. Besides that, there are plenty of other things that I left halfway, maybe that’s for another day. Because of said stagnation, I drove myself into this deep depression and resentment. And I can’t claw my way out of this.   
  
I have no reasoning for all of this. I want to justify the things that I’m feeling, but I can’t. Sometimes I wish something bad would happen to me so I can say “yes that’s exactly why I’m feeling empty/depressed”.   
Or maybe I don’t want to help myself? I don’t know, I don’t have the answer to that yet.   
  
I intended to write more on this, but I got stuck in the mud and lost my train of thought. One day, I hope to write another...  
  
Thank you for reading,   
I hope all of you find the strength to fight these silent battles.

I probably gonna kill myself the next year,"I was raped when i was younger, lost my last job because of an anxiety dissorder and panic attacks and at the end i was in a psychward, in this time my own family had nothing better to do as using me and my money while i was suffering. They never cared about me. In the last years multiple familymember died and it was too much for me, i always feel horrible since that, had selfharm ocd and did selfharm, thinking almost everyday about suicide. I tried to open up to my friends but all i got  was a ""yea, happens"" when i tried to slowly open up and they just ignored me. Everyday, i hear from some idiot how easy my life is. I just can't do this anymore. Nobody needs me in this shitty world. Friends mock me because i told them i'm a virgin ( i don't have to tell you why, it should be obviously ) I get mocked, how bad my future is looking because i'm jobless and on top i have to hear from really, every fucking person fucking how easy and cool it would to be me, i just can't do this anymore. I want to die. I planed some long time ago, to kill myself on this day, i think this will be it. I'm not strong enough anymore to keep living, atleast not like that.",1
When?,"Hey all. I'm new to this subreddit, but have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ocd, and panic disorder since around 2010. When I was younger I was told and shown that life when you are an adult becomes so much more freeing and liberating. I am 24 now, graduated college, have a full time job, and things have only gone downhill since 2010. I have family near me, friends I hang out with often, but most of my life just feels useless. I used to have so much fun when me and friends hung out, that the downtime away from them didn't feel as bad. But now, it all just feels like a chore. I am medicated, and have been for years, and have been going to therapy for many as well. But tbh, I can't do this shit till I'm old. I have maybe 5 more years in me, at most. Everything I do, it feels like I am doing it out of necessity rather than wanting to do it. And I understand that is how much of life is, but I would rather just brave the unknown than continue on doing this till the end. If 90% of my life is going to be wake up, work, clean, spend 2 hours to myself, repeat then what is the point? I have two nieces which I adore, but life is crushing man. I know many of you are going to say that they would be sad or confused if I did it, but i cant remeber the last time i felt a real emotion. The last time I cried was 2018, i cant remeber the last time i genuinely laughed or smiled because it all feels like a front at this point. When does this shit get better, if it ever does?",1
Will it ever be ok,Will the silence be ok. Will my thoughts ever calm or will they continuously lose control and just become so toxic and unbearable. Everything seems ok but I feel like it’s all a lie. Being alone is hard but I will not put myself through another relationship like my former one but then I’m stuck with me. Alone with me… I don’t even like me. I have so much disgust and hatred for myself and feel vain whenever I do appreciate myself. I don’t like this shell I’m in. But even if I were to go on from this life. Would it finally be over? Or will I have to live with this nonsense again. I see the beauty but the pain. The pain is too intense. It’s too overwhelming. This life I know has suffering. I know it’s somewhat normal. There is supposed to be a balance but I feel like the scales have tipped and I’ve drowned into the abyss. Is there a way out? Or will I lose when I slip.,1
Don’t feel like myself anymore and it’s affecting my marriage.,Title says it all. I don’t know what to do. Therapy isn’t working. Pills help a little but the feeling always comes back. I miss being happy. It’s been so long,1
Life after life-long depressions,"Hey everyone,

just wanted to share a little bit how my life feels now that I got out of my depressions. I’m a 29F & have had depression almost my whole life, starting with my teenage years and only a few months spread in between where it wasn’t as severe. The past 6 years were pretty difficult & when pmds & more family matters hit as well, i reached a new low with heavy suicidal thoughts & ways of fulfilling them.

I’m now 3,5 years into therapy & been on prozac for the past 2 months & i am a new me. I took off taking meds for so long, but I truly feel like myself now. I am enjoying life again & am looking forward to whatever is ahead of me. Occasionally I feel like deep down there is still the depression lurking & wants to come out, but it’s manageable.

Both therapy (still ongoing) & medication did it for me to not struggle existing anymore. I just wanted to say that sometimes it might work, even ehen it feels all lost. I came to terms that I am that person who has no energy for anything, is overwhelmed & exhausted easily by everything & is constantly negative & exhausted by merely existing. Now I know that this in fact was not the permanent state I was supposed to be in & how good living can feel. I came to acceptance with my depression & lifestyle (which made me more depressed bcs i kept pitying myself). 

I remember reading somewhere ‘when things become better, they usually don’t come back & share that, they don’t need the platforms anymore’ which is why i just wanted to share this, in case just one person need’s a little bit of an hopeful outcome from a stranger. 

Hope you all are able to come past this, no matter how long it takes!",1
I can't get out of my bed ?,"That strange loop in which you want to be a better person, more productive and healthy, but you simply can't get out of bed... I love sleeping, no matter how many problems I have, I can always sleep and it's hard for me to get out of bed, not to mention the food, I'm too lazy to eat and I only do it because I'm so hungry but the fact of cooking...dah",1
I'm so tired,"Nothing is set in stone in life and everyone walks a different path but I've always believed that a universal truth is that you're supposed to try different things and fail. You have to fail a lot. You get some wins and successes along the way by learning from these failures.

But I'm so tired of failure. When everything I try in my life no matter how small results in humiliating failure, I struggle to see what more lessons I can learn. 

I don't yearn for a lot. I've wanted to end my life since I was 14. I'm 25. For most of that time I still tried and failed. Then in college I coasted through not caring about what it was like after I got my degree or if I even liked the field. I wasn't going to be around, after all. Obviously I didn't even successfully end my life.

I failed relaitionships, personal projects, finding a job, weightloss, improving health and everything else.

At some point, the failure stops being a teacher. It just morphs into a constant reminder and validation that I am not good enough and likely never will be.

It shouldn't be this hard. I shouldn't be this weak and stupid but yet I see everyone around me despite their struggles thriving and growing and learning and I just fucking can't. 

I can't believe I fought the suicidal thoughts for so long, clawing towards a life I thought was maybe worth living only for this to be it.

I don't want wealth. I don't want sex. I don't even want a family. I'd be ok if I could just move out and live by myself and see what else life has in store no matter how small but I just can't do it. It's failure at every turn. I get it. I get it. I'm not supposed to fixare on success. It's the journey.

Well I'm tired of the journey. I'm tired of putting so much effort into myself and the things around me only to be left in the dust by my peers. I don't envy or wish ill on them. I love my friends, but DAMN is it humiliating how much more vibrant and beautiful and full of life they are. I feel like such an embarrassment whenever I'm around them. Like an ugly inept eyesore. I feel so ashamed of everyone asking me what's new and for the answer to always be ""Well I tried X or Y or kept up with Z but nothing really came of it"" every single time.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. My dreams turned to dust long ago and I'm seemingly not even good enough for the most basic menial tasks. 

I'm so tired.",1
I can’t do my hobby anymore,"Sorry if it sounds childish in advance… I’ve been doing gel x for a few months now, but I developed a gel allergy. While it’s not to the point where I get blisters, my cuticles itch after every set I do. I was very excited to be starting nail classes next month so that I could learn to do them professionally, but some stuff came up with my parents and financial aid so I wasn’t able to apply. I made an attempt to let my mom know that I wanted to get an allergy test at the dermatologist so if in case I was allergic to HEMA or something, I could try another HEMA free brand. Today I decided to just sell all my supplies I’ve bought during the past months. These include acrylic supplies, gel x supplies, nail charms, nail powders, practice hand lamps etc. I’ve always been self conscious about my feet, but the other day I was telling my boyfriend how happy I was to finally be able to wear open toe shoes without being embarrassed of them since I’ve been doing my own nails, but now that’s pretty much over. I don’t do much, I don’t have siblings, not much friends, parents are always gone, I’ve just been waiting for school to start up again. On top of everything it’s very frustrating to hear my mom complain about me not having a job. I told her me doing nails would’ve allowed me to have a job and do what I wanted. She’d pay ungodly amounts for other hobbies like dancing and stuff she wants me to be in, but because nail techs don’t have a retirement, she didn’t want me to get too comfortable and stay there as a nail tech. Doing my nails gave me confidence, and the feeling of accomplishment, as well as the ability to be creative. All the time, practice, money… down the drain.",1
"Tbh I don't know what peace feels like, why do I have to go through this","My dog, my support dog after my grandma passed away, marshmellow is his name. he ran away today and yes I'm blaming my mom because she was dumb enough to leave him outside all alone. She has had that habit and luckily in the past he was right there at the door but nope not this time. He was my only hope, he made me feel grounded and safe but now he is no where to be found. I am so fucking tired of experiencing grief, I lost my dog, my grandma, great grandma, great great grandma, older sister, my dad just got locked up yet again, all the people I once called my friends are gone they dont give af about me, my mental health, happiness, stablity, etc are now tainted. Can I have any fucking peace. I feel so much and the things I am feeling are nothing but depression and anger. I need to just be okay, thats all I want. My mom is a bitch who makes me feel like shit for feeling as much as I do but guess what she can be emotional all she like, she can express her emotions but when I do it I'm given a whole speech of ""advice"" or shot down. I feel invalidated by life. I hate this shit",1
ghosting,"why do i always ghost everyone?

i'll always make friends and shit like that, but then i just feel the need to escape from them. just ignore them for months on end. and then one day, i'll randomly come back. and then after a week or two, i'll disappear for months again.

i ask the question, ""why do i always ghost everyone?""
but in the end, i know why. i don't deserve the attention they give me, i don't deserve the time they waste on me, and i don't deserve even a sliver of happiness they give me.

their happiness that they share with me will just disappear shortly after anyway, it all just goes away.

this goes into another topic as well. i literally just can't let myself be happy.

feeling like shit all the time is comfortable to me. the moment i ever feel even slightly happy, i panic. it doesn't feel right, it just isn't right. how can i even allow someone so selfish and awful such as myself be even a little happy? i can't. and i never will.

one day i plan to end my life. don't know when, jusy eventually. could be soon, could take a while. i have unfinished buisness before i do, however.

anyway thanks for reading this dumb little rant. if you leave a comment, don't say some dumb shit like ""it'll get better!!! i promise!!!"" i've heard that empty promise more than i ever wanted to.",1
I'm so annoyed with being alive.,"I'm not angry, sad, or anything of that sort at this point. I'm currently sitting here with four assignments due for today and tomorrow, astounded at how tedious everything is. I fail to see why I'm forced to do anything at all. When did I sign up to go to school, get a job, maintain my physical and mental health, and slave away for society? I never did. And yet here I sit doing nothing productive because my (presumably) ADHD brain can't handle placing the effort I'm putting into writing this post into actually doing my assignments.

What's even the point? I wish I could buy a nitrogen gas canister, and close my eyes as I drift away in peace. I don't like it here. It's so boring.",1
Depression,"I don’t know how to cope with depression. I am 21 years old, and I achieved something in life at the age of 18 by working abroad. I earned my things; I always persevered on my own. I have the physique of a bodybuilder, I know that I am handsome, tall, but I struggle with depression. I feel like trash going through a life that doesn’t make sense anyway. I miss having a family and tenderness. Today’s rat race for everything depresses me. People are artificial. I am a highly sensitive person, and externally, I appear tough based on my posture. I cry every day while working at the company. Medication helps me indirectly because I often break down. I miss an intelligent woman who would be loyal and sensitive, and it wouldn’t matter how many outings we have on the weekend. Suicidal thoughts haunt me every day for the past 5 years since my parents’ divorce. It hurts that I don’t have their support. I would most prefer to put a gun to my throat and shoot myself, but I lack the courage. I am suffering terribly. I would like put gun to my throat and shoot",1
Is it intrusive thoughts or an actual voice in my head?,"Literally every second of the day my head is filled with bad thoughts. I’ve always said it was persistent intrusive thoughts but now I’m wondering if I’m crazy and it’s actually a voice. It tells me I’m worthless, useless, no one loves me, no one likes me, I’d be better off dead, worthless piece of shit. I see therapists and on meds but literally 100% of the time I feel like I’m a failure.",1
I'm having troubles ingesting my meds,"(23F) I'm having troubles trying to ingest my meds.
My therapy consists in 2 different pills I have to both take at breakfast time and again after dinner, but I'm failing to take them correctly because of the trouble I have everytime I try: the pills are kinda big so I take a mouthful of any sugary drink (preferably fruit juice), stick the pill inside my mouth and pray that it goes down smooth, until it doesn't and as I lightly feel the texture of the pill touching my throat I get immediately a violent gag reflex. I don't know why I have this damn sensitivity but that's forcing me to choose to not treat myself and I will never heal.",1
My friends are pushing me away.,"For context, I have been friends with these two guys for most of my life (I’m 20m) my friends are the same age, recently we went abroad to do nothing but have fun but I tend to drink a lot more than my friends so when we would go out I ended up always having to take care of them. And don’t get me wrong of course I’d rather take care of them than let them get hurt or something but in the morning I would jokingly say I had to take care of them but by day three I think they got fed up with me because even I realised that I would be moody before we went out knowing I would have to take care of them.

Anyway since then, they haven’t really talked to me and I can’t blame them, we haven’t went out, played games or even texted, it kinda hurts but I don’t hate them for it, why would they bother hanging out with me when I kill the mood sometimes haha.

I don’t wanna reach out to them to be honest, it’s been made clear that I’m on my own for now at least. 

Anyway, and ideas on how I could distract myself for a little while? Thanks in advance.",1
Depression/Adderall Addiction,"I used to be addicted to Adderall then meth. I went to rehab 3 yrs ago was doing great and the past six months became severely depressed, no motivation, no energy or focus. I got back on Adderal to help with motivation/focus and abuse it. For the week it lasts I’m happy, energetic, motivated and can function. No depression. Im already on depression meds and have tried other with no luck. I don’t want to go back to addiction but I need something to help me get out of bed and be productive.

Not wanting to talk,Does feeling depressed not really wanting to talk but able to post stories?,1
Ever feel it coming? But not sure if you can stop it this time,"I’ve fortunate to me depression free for about a year now.. my friends even told me they are proud of me. However, As of late, I feel it brewing. I know that feeling I just can’t explain. That sudden sadness that washes over you. You don’t want it to come back. You don’t want to tell the same friends (your core support group) that you are starting to struggle again. My friends are living happy lives - why burden them with my problems?

I’m starting my self coping methods, listening to music, relaxing, watching tv shows. If I have to - take a Xanax. But still, I always fear that depression is going to come full force again and I’ll rapidly spiral. 

Why can’t it be gone once and for all? 😔",1
I am tired and constantly anxious about my life… I’ve just had enough (PLEASE READ),"This life thing I’ve been doing for a couple years ‘properly’ now, is now starting to get really tiring for me. My name’s Oli and I’m 21 years old who lives in the UK. Everyday I wake up anxious / scared as fuck of going to work which is so toxic that I can hear people talking crap about me (mainly my boss and his PA who works in accounts) which is so draining and just makes me feel worthless. I’ve worked there for about 17 months now, I gained my qualification through their apprenticeship (I have a BTEC extended national diploma in Software and Game development too + 6 GCSEs including English & Maths) however, I’m just not happy and I’m really, really tired of life.

I’m scared of the what if’s 24/7. Like, in this day in age with society, no job is guaranteed, anyone could let you go in a second and then BOOM - you are homeless and everyone looks at you as a fucking slug who is worthless to even look at. I’m so upset on what life is. Humans are judged by a fucking shitty piece of A4 paper and expecting to be perfect all of the time. I hate seeing people financially struggle and work 50+ years of their life only to die chasing the money purely for survival.

I wish I could change the world and let humans live freely without slaving away just to get by… but I can’t, or else I’ll just vanish like the other people that tried.

I’m severely anxious and depressed, I need help but I’m just so tired of all the shit I’ve been and am currently going through.

I’m in a very good relationship, but, I’m not happy with how life is and i just can’t accept it.

I don’t want to do what society wants and would like. Like what, work for the rest of your life for some bitch boss who pays shit money and can get rid of you at any given moment and ruin your life??? Im done.

Fuck society, im not writing anymore on this particular post, I need help as my head is fucking me up and I’m constantly scared of change, financial stability, failure, homelessness, the way society sees me, death, being broke, etc.

What is wrong with me and what can I do to help, I just want to be fearless and change the world and be happy.

My dream is to travel the world and help people, not working an office job, I’d rather do something that makes me Healy and benifits other peoples health and life and just truly changing the the world and showing people that humans deserve to live a stress free life. 

I’m very religious and believe in god and always try to do good. Like, behind everything there is always a creator… remember that, that’s why gods real!

Anyways, I could keep on going, but I’ll end up writing fa book on how I lido like to change the world and stop being depressed and anxious all the time.

Please help me, what can I do to be happy and just fearless of everything in life? I’m 21…. I don’t want to die, but my god, I’m tired and nothing makes me satisfied, nor does anything make me happy or excited no more like it used to.

Please help, I don’t expect any help as I would prefer other people would be helped instead of me, but if there is anyone that could help me, please help me end this constant anxiety and fear and depression of this thing called life.",1
I just don’t feel much of anything for some reason.,"Since January, it just feels like I’ve been going through the motions. I laugh and cry on occasion, but a lot of it just doesn’t feel authentic or real to me, if that makes sense. It feels like I’m just alive most days, doing the same boring old patterns while being too scared to break out of them. I’m just typing this out because it’s always been easier for me to convey my feelings into writing as opposed to speaking with someone about it who might not be able to relate to or understand what I’m saying.",1
"Dropped everything, impossible to find motivation","I feel like I have dropped all my responsibilities and priorities in life. 

I don’t clean anymore.
I don’t or hardly do laundry anymore.
I don’t visit grandparents and family anymore. 
I struggle to do grocery shopping, I mostly order takeout.
I go to bed at crazy times and struggle to fall asleep/get out of bed in the morning.
I can hardly get myself to go to work and every morning I consider just giving up and not going. The only thing keeping me motivated is the fear of losing my flat. 
I miss deadlines, do a shitty job at work and avoid contact with anyone if I can.
I feel drained, incredibly bored and restless at the same time. 
I overthink, doomscroll or spiral in paranoid thoughts quite a lot and fear that my bf will abandon me (which tbf I would understand, I am annoying and needy when I feel insecure). 

I want all of these things to get better, but it feels so impossible to even do one of these things. Usually I find it so tough to even physically move from the place Im at.

The only thing that motivated me still was to hang out with my bf and to spend time together. Im noticing that even there my motivation is fizzling out though. When he asks to do stuff, go shopping or go for walks now, I say yes, but rly I just wanna stay in and “exist” most of the time, whereas I used to be rly excited to do stuff he suggested. Anything that requires any kind of effort, I just do not want to do.

I know Im ranting and I would really like to feel in control of my life again. Im just cruising through life right now, collecting regret and guilt along the way because of the things I give up on, the family and friends I avoid, my work I dont do well anymore and the responsibilities I ignore. 

Went to my GP and explained this stuff, but I really dont see any of this improving any time soon. I feel like a victim of myself. I dont take care of myself and my environment, and I lack all of the motivation/sense of responsibility to do so. I notice that I just dont really care enough anymore, even though I would really like to. Is this part of depression or am I just a shitty human?",1
This sucks,"For some reason today sucks. Not even the medicine is helping. I'm going to have to force myself to drive to get something to eat because otherwise I won't. I'm hungry with no appetite. I'm so so drained. So much class work and exams to worry about. I feel bad but my cat is really annoying me today. She won't eat her food because she's picky and keeps meowing at my door. She also made a mess with her little box and kept walking by meowing and messing with the bleach bottle as I tried to clean it up. I just want to have nothing bothering me at all. I'm even upset because it's too hot with the heating and without it, it's too cold. I'm extremely uncomfortable with everything right now. I'm both hungry and full, cold and hot, sleepy and awake, annoyed and apathetic. I also got called bipolar as an insult today which was just amazing :^))))",1
idek what to do anymore,"20 m here, life seems so meaningless right now. am addicted to phone and weed. why am i even here if i don't bring any purpose.",1
Need it off my chest.,"It's 2AM and maybe I'm not thinking straight.
At the end of everyday I feel unsatisfied, yes I do things that I like, I hung out with friends and I practiced my hobbies, still I'm revenge bedtime procrastinating like I'm missing something. But it's school, If I go to sleep now, I'll have to go to school sooner. I have one friend who doesn't hang out with me outside of school. I think I'm getting dumber since I'm not understanding anything I'm getting taught, I'm thinking of just not doing any homework anymore and not learn for the tests and see what happens. When I come home from school, everyday at 4PM I just lay down tired, I wait for dinnertime and then after dinner I do my homework, after homework play games and then I lay in bed until 2-3AM. Every morning I'm tired. I'm asking myself if I'm ever truly happy. 
If it weren't for a comic book and my favorite band, I'd have given up already.

This post is so unorganised and probably meaningless, but I just had lots of things to say.",1
Feeling like you're not suited to be a person/alive?,"Hi, for context I've had depression for as long as I can remember and I've always had this feeling that I'm just not cut out for life or that I've irreparably damaged myself and my life and I can't do anything to improve my situation so I might as well die because my own actions have made my situation so that my life will never be exactly how I want it to be. For example, at the moment I'm struggling with the fact that I have awful posture and always have had it, and it's very likely the reason for which I have precordial catch syndrome, which makes it even harder for me to complete tasks like folding laundry or picking things up when I get my chest pain. The fact that I have this irreversible damage to my body because of my bad posture that I cannot fix because of my low self esteem making it impossible for me to hold my body in the right posture, makes me feel like I'll never be able to live a good life because of the problems caused by this bad posture. Another example of this is college applications. I'm a senior in high school and everyone at my school has finished filling out applications and I'm too nervous to ask my teachers for recommendations even though I know I'm a good student and my teachers would probably say yes if I asked them, I just feel like it's too late for me and I might as well give up, and since I can't go to a four year college because of the fact that I've missed the early action deadline for so many of the schools I want to go to, and because I'm so terrified of asking for recommendations, I shouldn't keep on living because all of my procrastination and inability to do things that most of my peers are able to do, I am not fit for life and I should just die. Anybody know what this is called or how to stop this? Thanks.",1
I’m extremely lost. No hope,"I’ve recently come to conclusion that I'm probably autistic. I have an extremely hard time interacting with people and avoid interactions/parties with my friends and family because of it. I have never been able to get close to people because I lack the social ability to. It has made me extremely depressed and I have felt this way since I was very young. 

I have a lot of other problems such as bipolar disorder but I am currently taking medication so I don't experience any episodes. Pretty sure I have a learning disability as well because I am awful at everything I do. I repeat the same routine everday and I hate it. I wake up, go on my phone, feed my cat, eat sometime during the day, then go to sleep. This has been my life for the majority of my life. My average daily screen time this week was 11 hours a day and sometimes it can even get up to 14 hours a say every week. I've done nothing my whole life except browse the internet and play video games.

I hate doing these things everyday but I don't know what else to do. Everything is really hard for me if it isn't sleep, video games, or browsing the internet. My diet is terrible too but I am sure it is because of my autism. I've always been an incredibly picky eater and I hate it as it is just another social barrier I have.  I am losing hope on being normal. I used to be able to somewhat mask before I had a big mental breakdown in 2020 and everything has gotten worse. I have had a girlfriend and we dated for 6 months but after my breakdown we seperated. After the break up I realized I was masking almost the entire time I was with her

Again, not sure if I have autism but it explains a lot. Not sure why I made this post. Just lost and looking at what I can do. I am becoming suicidal again but I really don't want to die. Just I don't see any other way out of this misery every single day",1
I wish my life didn't get ruined by people,"I was on such a good course, everything was good. Growing up I dealt with bullying but nothing else. but as I got older, I got exposed to bad parts of the internet (I joined, regrettably, a furry community after being groomed by a creep). Which led to, obviously bad things for a minor joining such a community. I got manipulated and traumatized, leaned on it more as I didn't really have friends irl. (I got a group shortly after irl, they were horrible sociopaths).   


During high school I was bullied a lot, beaten, attempted to be blinded and the principle sided with the kid that tried to blind me, so did the leader of the group I was in, I was sexually manipulated. I kept getting fake friends and ended up being hurt bad back to back to back. I had no justice, it was always against me.   


In college I got raped by a 25-year-old woman. She manipulated me heavily and made me fear ever saying no to her, and eventually used that. Even worse she did this when dating a very sweet and kind student (probably also manipulated). I developed sexual issues (I was a hypersexual before, no outlet in any healthy form, then this happens) No longer a hypersexual but I can't even approach sexual stuff anymore. I couldn't masturbate without flashbacks. It was fucking horrible, still haunts me three years later. Ended up with an ex that was a manipulative bitch, she gave me a panic attack so bad I had stomach acid come into my vocal cords for a prolonged period causing me to get sick and develop permanent damage to them. Ever since that day I have not been able to breathe without feeling like there is a hand around my neck, I cannot yawn, I am extremely short of breath, no treatment has worked (no medicine, breathing therapy didn't do shit and I nearly pass out from it).   


I had another ex, who had mental issues, you can guess how that went. This ended mid 2023. I developed pneumonia around the time and spent summer at home, I'm still dealing with damage to my airways from it. It sucks. breathing is even worse.   


after years of trying i made one good friend, she was like an older sister. Apparently I somehow hurt her after standing up to the pervert that sexually assaulted her and groomed several other people (and still was) in her friend group. I lost everything for not putting up with a horrible person. She has mental issues and I believe that contributes to how she felt about me. Definitely not a real friend :/ (Therapist was given details, I say she isn't a real friend not because I feel that way but giving all the facts to my therapist they weren't a good friend, hard for me to see because I never had a friend I talked with all the time for months on end with and genuinely never had a dry spell with).   


I'm about to graduate university with no friends, no parties, no fun experiences, nothing. I am alone almost all the time and its really getting to me. I feel so sad, I wish I had one good person in my life. I wish I didn't have a fear of women now. I try to join online communities but I'm terrified, it gives me such horrible anxiety.  I feel like I'm just going to live in the shadows my whole life. I can't get a friend, I am scared of people, I just wish I never dealt with the groomer in the first place.  


I've always been a very sweet and gentle person, people have used me so much for that. I hate it, I wish one person appreciated me for who I am, for my qualities, instead of use it. It feels like nobody ever will.   


I hope life gets better, I'm grateful I never gave up on my studies no matter how miserable I got. I managed there. ",1
a really bad day.,ive struggled with depression for years and it comes and goes but only a few times have i actually felt suicidal. ive been trying to do good ive really been doing inner work and spending time with family and friends. but today i just had a really hard day and on my drive home from work i had to pull over. an overwhelming wave of sadness came over me and i just felt so alone in that moment. and i really started contemplating. looking at maps seeing if there was any near by bridges i just feel so alone and  like only my family would care and be effected. i don’t play a big role in anyones life to the point that it would really effect anyones life and that hurts me so bad. i just really want to be held but theres no one to hold me. i wiped my tears and kept going like i usually do because i haven’t ever got the balls to truly go through with it but i just feel so lost and alone. and the holidays never help that empty feeling. i feel so useless. i really hope i find some peace soon,1
Depressed and don’t know why,So I was on drugs for 7-8 years. Been clean for 4 years now. Still very unhappy. I’m wondering just how depressed I was before drugs.I don’t really recall being depressed but maybe I was and didn’t really realize it. So how does someone find the source of depression if the don’t know what it is. PLEASE PLEASE  DO NOT SUGGEST THERAPY.I see a therapist 2 times a month.to me suggesting a therapist is not helpful advice. What would you tell me if you were my therapist.,1
sick of adhd and hs,"^ title: i feel hopeless towards my life and existential. i can be so happy and grateful some days, but this thing sorta comes out of nowhere for an hour. just cried yesterday, and this is what sparked my ideas and thoughts on this matter:



i dont know what to do to destress now. i unbelievably hate highschool for far too many reasons. putting in effort to get bad grades, my schools authority and tardy policy, derealization, staying at school for far too long for band rehearsals, and depression. i have tried for far too long to make an improvement at this school, but nothing works. i moved here from a fancy charter school which was fantastic, but florida public school? fucking sucks. i cant move now because i am a senior, but anything would be better at the moment.

i still try a heck of a lot, but i get too much advice that it doesnt work. i definitely feel horrible about not using good advice i hear all the time. generally, with how bad my anxiety is, i feel like it’s not enough to live off habits that can only help me so much. i feel awful not being able to superhero-ify myself, but i just forget it all and get too stressed or bored. part of this is me being super critical of myself

i *do* take cold showers. i blast my ass for so long in those things (been doing them 10 months. 10 months!!!). yeah even despite living in florida, i use ice from my fridge and lift it over my head just so i can get cold enough. yes, these have helped, but they help a little too well, or just are too hard to plan out. i take them at night because i have to (school starts so early… 6 miles of traffic into school at 7am if i want to be on time). i have been trying forever to take them into the morning or stopping them, but it just feels like an addiction i have. but also, i feel like my self worth is based on these showers (i got into that habit when ive taken them for so long on and off since 3rd grade). 

i just now recently stopped them and started taking warm showers, but it still has messed up my sleep schedule, and i dont feel routine enough to restart school tomorrow.



executive function and cognitive dissonance:

i feel that those “skills”, tips, or thoughts to get out of depression/suicide are not working. they either take too long to get started, or (horribly) i forget them. it never helps when i feel so limited in high school. i believe college will be the fruits of my labor and have the successful habits i already have be beneficial. 

i also do stupid shit, like wear the same pair of pants everyday or not wash my hair (because im am so fucked). i feel so left out because of these things. but i definitely have a conflict of interest between them (i.e dont wash hair everyday because its bad? or wear whats confortable for a happy life). only in some cases do i push past these conflicts like with me finally taking melatonin (common anxiety issue btw that i feel towards other things: melatonin = pill, i take pill for sleep, i take *drug* for sleep, i am bad person because drug, bad person = melatonin).

i guess what can i do now? right now i have a pildonial cyst that has been killing me, and now i have a broken nail on my toe. i have had shingles in the past from pure stress unfortunately.



note: i have been diagnosed adhd-inattentive at the start of this year. i have been diagnosed with an adjustment disorder after moving, and other things like that. im taking concerta right now, a sorta effect medication, but i have been noticing an increase in heart rate and insomnia. its very common to feel like my heart is going to explode out of my chest.",1
Does it get better?,"I'm 32, struggling with depression for years.

just got back to college after thanksgiving break and damn I feel so lonely and lost. decided to go out and shop for something that I've wanted, literally left the store cause I just wanted to lay in bed instead. 2 more weeks until I go home for winter break. idk how I'm gonna push through the week.

Also, I have a fairly normal life. There isn't much to complain about. I'm fortunate enough to have food, shelter and clothing.",1

Am i depressed?,Ive talked to a few people and they usually just say im depressed but i dont feel like i am like most people do but i get the feeling of crying alot but i never actually cry the last time i actually cried was 2 years ago when my grandpa died but i didnt even know him like that ive only ever met him like 3 times but i cried and then my other grandpa died a few months ago and i saw him almost every single day but i didnt cry when he died. Another thing that happens is i get really sentimental about things like the other day i went to a concert and after it was over i felt off and weird and got sentimental about it like i was going to cry but didnt and the it happened again today and i just dont understand it.,1

Disappear like I've never exist,"Hi! I'm female, 17 yo. Right now, I badly want to disappear. I don't want to exist. I just want to disappear like I've never exist before, but, how?

Beforehand, I'm not an English native speaker, so, I'm so sorry if I make a mistakes with my words. I don't know who else or where i can share my thoughts. So I'll just write it here.

In October 2022 I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, I go to a psychiatrist, and I take some medicine. I also have been hospitalized before because of attempting suicide— I was there for just one week.

It's been quite a long time that I can't feel happiness (Maybe it's been a 5 years, or more) I'm lossing my interest for everything, even for a things that i previously like and bring me joy. All I know is sadness, madness, and emptiness. I can feel it in my body, all the parts of my body, especially my head, and my chest, was feel so heavy. Nearly the end of the year 2022 is where all of this got worst. 

I swear to God, I can't focusing on doing something. I can't do simple things such as going to school, doing my chores, or socialize with people—my friends, even my family. I isolated myself, I'm so exhausted, I don't have any strength left behind, even to just take a breathe. It get worst, I didn't go to school, I don't take a good care of myself. My bedroom, is full of chaos—it's so full of trash, all of my clothes, school amenities, etc. Everything were scattered in my room. My room is so messy, and so do I. It's not just my mental health, but my physical health was also fall in a really bad situations. Well, I know, it's my fault... Cause I really don't take a good care of myself at that time, i barely eat, i hurt body, i don't take care of my hygiene— I barely take a bath, sometimes I'll just wash myself and brush my teeth, and that's it (ik it's gross, I'm sorry...)

I, just wanted to die.

I feel like I'm a failure, as a child, as a siblings, and as a human. I have a really low confidence, I don't trust myself, I doubted myself. All i think about is that I wanted to disappear, and then it's change to ""I want to die"" I do self harm a lot, when I feel all the bad emotions, I started to punch my head so all of the gut wrenching feeling disappear. It's feels good, like a kill switch for my brain. But you know what? I feel it everyday, so, like, literally everyday, I hurt myself. Other than that, I really wanted to die. Sometimes I take a lot of pills, hoping that it'll slowly kill me, but luckily, it didn't work. And the peak was, one day, early in the morning where I couldn't sleep, I'm alone with my fucked up thoughts, I decided to go on in the middle of the road, hoping for some car to crashed my body. But When I heard Azaan (It's a call to pray for a Muslim) I walked back to my house. In the middle of the day, it was my schedule to go to my therapist, I'm telling her that I almost kill myself. She's telling me, if i want to, i should go to psych ward. I agree with her, in my mind, i just wanted to recover. I just want to live a ""normal life"".

I don't really remember a thing when I was there, but, like, I don't really want to go there ever again. Since then, I'm telling myself. ""If you want to die then die right now. And if you're gona live your life then you should do it right."" Honestly, I really don't want anything anymore. I don't see a point of living, and I don't see the point of death neither. 

I choose to live. I tried to build my life again. I try to think positive, take a really good care of myself, rebuild a good relationships with people around me. 

Because I didn't go to my school for a long period of time, I take a risk to drop out of that school, I declare my resignation. My teacher was trying convinced me to not drop out from that school. It was a really difficult choice for me, I can say that my school is very nice, the teachers, friends and everything there was sooo nice. But I really can't study there again... In this year, gladly, I was accepted at a school to start my school life again. I even got into my dream major. I met a new friends, i met a cool teacher, I even joined an organization at my school. I'm proud of myself for all of this.

Right now, I can do things that I couldn't do before. I go to school, doing all my school assignments (Even though it's a little difficult, I can still do it) I take a good care of myself, I take a bath everyday, I eat 3 meal a day, I put on my skincare routine, I can go out with my family, with my friends (Even tho after that I feel like my energy was sucked off, but I can still do it) Basically I'm living my life.

But, I really feel empty inside, I feel like I'm a robot, with no emotions other than Sadness and Madness, again... I mean, idk, sometimes I think it's better for me to feel empty, better than to feel sadness every second of my life. I feel empty but my head feels so heavy. I think, in this past year, I push myself to feel numb. I did all those things I didn't really want to do, because, I didn't want anything anymore— other than disappear, like I never existed.

Anyway, idk if there's anyone who'll read this post, but, whoever you are, thankyou so much for taking your time to read my thoughts. And wherever you're, may peace, love and happiness have their way with you. I wish the best for you, don't forget to take care of yourself. I give my warmest hug for all of you.",1
Learning to live again…,"I’ve struggled for the better part of a decade with depression, PTSD, panic disorder among other disorders affecting physical and mental health. Three years ago today, I checked into an inpatient facility recognizing I was no longer safe with myself. Three years later and I’ve finally reached a point where things are going alright again. I still actively struggle with the aforementioned issues, but I also find that I take genuine joy in life again. I’m the top of my class in my university within my major, I’m in a relationship that seems on track to turn into an engagement and eventual marriage, my relationship with my friends have never been better. I find myself smiling again. This is the first time in my life I can say that I’m free of suicidal thoughts and at peace with the direction my life is taking. I’m writing this post because I’m in an odd place of disbelief. I still struggle daily with panic attacks, mood swings, poor appetite and sleep, exhaustion, depressed mood, and all the other ins and outs of depression. I’m not cured, and it’s hard to not get mad at myself. There’s more positive in my life than ever before, and yet, Im still depressed. I guess 8 years of pain and struggle don’t just disappear overnight, but I guess I hoped it would. I never planned on living this long, and now, I have to actually live and it’s odd.",1
No sense of self,"Hey all, 

Just wanted to vent and get some advice. I've been dealing with depression for the past 2 years. And I'm on uni break for around 3 months. As I was planning what to do on my break, the new hobbies I wanted to start and goals I wanted to achieve I realised that I have no sense of self. I used to do so many hobbies when I was younger and essentially had a raison d'etre. But in the last few years all of this has disappeared. I was brainstorming about the hobbies I wanted to do during my break when I realised that I have no motivation to do any of it. I can't bring myself to do it. My days consist mostly of  working out, uni stuff, cooking, cleaning and sleep. And when I'm not doing that I'm constantly distracting myself by being on my phone and watching shows and movies. And even uni, which I disliked so much, at least gave me an objective to work towards, finishing an assignment or studying for an exam. I realise now that I have no objective. I have friends who get amazing grades, have so many hobbies, stay fit and just generally do so well. And I have no idea how to get to their level of actually doing things for enjoyment. I just don't know what to do for the next 3 months of break. I've applied for a few casual jobs, but honestly that's just another way to distract myself. 

How do I enjoy stuff again? 

Sorry if this is incoherent and super ranty. Would appreciate any advice. ",1

And I know what you are going to say: ""curate your content"" or ""don't look at it"" BUT EVERYONE IS TELLING ME NOT TO LOOK AWAY AT THE STUFF THAT IS HAPPENING, NOT ONLY IT IS STRESSING ME THE HELL OUT BUT IN ALL HONESTY ITS MAKING ME EVEN MORE DEPRESSED EACH AND EVERY DAY I LOOK AT IT. THE SECOND I LOOK AT THE STUFF THAT IS HAPPENING I START BREAKING DOWN CRYING AND I JUST WANT EVERYTHING TO BE OK FOR ONE SECOND. JUST SO I HAVE PEACE IN THIS WORLD. BUT I FUCKING CAN'T I FUCKING CAN'T. AND ALSO MY FRIENDS KEEP ON SUFFERING TO THE POINT I WANT TO SUFFER SO THEY DONT HAVE TOO.

"Trying to get better, parents are not helping","Hello all, I’m 19F recently got back to college  from the thanksgiving holidays. I was sexually assaulted at the end of my freshman year of college leading to a number of things, my grades dropped and I’m overall not as assured. My employer over the summer saw my weakened state as an opportunity to bully me relentlessly. I never went to therapy over the summer. 

I started the current school year in a very bad place. I started therapy and it got a little better like there was a way out of this. Then it just… got bad again. I cant do any of my assignments and the semester is ending very soon. I went to the gym to get away from my problems and I think it’s genuinely the only thing stopping me from ending it all right now. I just don’t see a future where I succeed because my gpa is already in the shitter.

I’m from an immigrant background with parents who think acknowledging your mental health rather than keeping it to yourself is a slippery slope. My mom keeps starting fights accusing me of being lazy and that she doesn’t see me doing anything towards my future when I show her the things I am involved in for my resume, and the plan I have for the upcoming winter break to get a medical certification. 

I try to use buying one silly pair of earrings a week as a way to get through the week but my parents scold me for using the money I earned from the job I had to fight to get up for every morning. It’s a bad coping mechanism I know but I wish they wouldn’t embarrass me for it.

40 years old and no future,"Hey, so a few months ago I turned 40 and I thought I was fine with it, but since starting a new job I have realised just how much it is affecting me. I have been drinking very heavily (a bottle of wine most nights of the week) and have put on about 12 pounds in the space of 2 months, but I don't really care anymore.

I think what triggered it was that I got desperate after being out of work for 18 months and took a job that is pretty much the worst type of job for me, namely on phones in a call centre. To make it even worse, I am working with people who are pretty much all in their 20s (including 2 of my supervisors) and it has made me feel such a failure (with good reason) that I am 40 and working in an entry level, shitty call centre job instead of having a career. Every work day is a humiliation.

I only have myself to blame, which makes me feel even worse. I left school with few qualifications, not necessarily because I was bad at school but because I just didn't care about anything, not my school work, grades, exams, or future prospects. I went to a university but never used my degree, so it is basically not worth the paper it was written on.

I have never had interests in anything really, and every job I have ever had has felt like torture. So, given my lack of qualifications, life goals, career options, and social skills, my only real prospects for work are low-paying, monotonous, super stressful or back-breaking jobs. For this reason, my main goal for the last 20 years has been to avoid having a job when I can help it, which I have been relatively successful at, having only worked solidly for maybe half of that time. This, of course, has left me in even worse of a career position, as I have little job experience.

I think up until recently I had always kind of hoped that I would eventually find something that might interest me enough and/or had a solid prospect of employment after training to take on as a career. But now, at 40, I have realised that this is just never going to happen. My current job is a six month contract only, which will leave me in the same position I was before but even worse, because now the only career options realistically available to me will be call centre ones. I thought about the possibility of doing an A+ certificate in IT, but I will be pretty much in the exact same position that I am in now. 40 years old and only entry level, call centre roles as a possibility.

I guess I should be grateful that I was given a chance considering my job history, but I really only feel resentful. Resentful that I have to go to a job that I hate and causes me immense amounts of anxiety and stress, and resentful that I was born into this world that about as far removed from being designed for me as possible.

I've read and watched all the videos about turning your life around, but they are all aimed at people in their 20s-early 30s and also presuppose that you actually have interests (other than drinking). I feel that once you reach 40, if you haven't sorted your shit out then it's pretty much over.

I am at my lowest ever point, writing this while drinking another evening into the ether.

Thanks for reading.",1
Please help,"I'm really tired, friends.

TW: OFFING ONESELF.

Hi. I'm 29 F and I'm tired of living. 

I've been diagnosed with (severe severe) treatment resistent MDD, GAD and PMDD. I also have severe primary insomnia and I've been on meds for 2 years for that. 
I've been ill with the other 3 for 10 years, getting close to 11. 
The only time I ever felt mentally ok was when I was pregnant and then after that life has been a hell (baby is almost 7 mo now). 

To keep things simple: I have PMDD, which meant I was severely ill for 2 weeks in a month. You can look up John Hopkins pmdd symptoms and it has extensive lists what you can go through every single month ( it's mental and physical issues) and mine change every month so I can never be prepared (some things are set in stone that I know I have). Pmdd is like the ring leader, it eggs my other illnesses to become worse. I used to be diagnosed with BPD because I have like 8/10 of the symptoms but that's ONLY when it's my hell weeks (pmdd weeks). 

I've taken 6.different anti depressants and if they work, it's never longer than a year before they become useless. 
I have tried all kinds of herbal treatments. 
I've done ketamine infusions (550 per sessions, 8 of them). I've done TMS (36 sessions M-F) I've tried to make my diet better, I've exercised (and still do when I have time). I've tried to sleep on time. I've taken and take vitamins. 
I've been to therapy and DBT sessions. 
I'm taking a new medication that literally costs 1100 a month and that doesn't work either. 

My depression and anxiety are coming back even during my good weeks...I have been in duloxetine since last year March and it didn't help with pmdd but it kept my depression and anxiety somewhat at bay. I upped it when baby was born (120 mg from 60). I have very bad PTSD from being so ill after having baby ( couldn't take care of her for 24 hours alone for 4 whole months). 

I'm at my ends wits. I honestly don't know what to do. My illnesses are so severe that I cannot work. I've been to 2 mental institutions and I've tried to off myself 6 times (before baby). 


Fyi: never hurt the baby, never thought of hurting baby, I love her so much, she is the reason I haven't yeeted myself out the window. She's my everything.",1
I just realized that is my personality that makes everything to difficult for me,"I think I have failed to develop a reliable personality or what should I call it that should function automatically to make proper reactions to the outside world. 
For example your body or brains know how to react if somebody makes you feel uncomfortable, but for me I don't have any of the sense. 
Dealing with people, making reactions to any situations have never been installed in my brain, and neither can I express my feelings of love or trust. What's worse, I don't know how to form questions or how to ask people for help. I have never learned and I know normally people do such a thing unconsciously. 
I have to take a lot of energy everyday to think about how to react to any of these. When my surroundings are filled with good people, I can be worry free since they would take care of me, but if I somehow ended up somewhere there are people who spot my weakness and start to take advantage of me, then I am really suffering from it. 
This makes me not see my future, I am such a failure of everything, I am 34 years old and haven't started anything since I couldn't handle these overwhelming situations. 
I have tried to end myself but it wasn't easy to achieve. 
Is there anybody just like me? Please talk to me about your story please, thank you!",1

Life is Beautiful. Death is Not the End.,"Life is beautiful. It's a gift. No matter how much we struggle. Sometimes struggling is a part of that beauty. Sometimes you can see it hidden in your pain. And your pain becomes beautiful. 

No matter how much I struggle, and sometimes it's alot, I never wish for my life to end. Sometimes I feel like I can't bear the pain and I want the pain to end. But I know that death is not the end to pain. You bring everything with you when you die.

I would never ask for blind faith. I only ask you to observe life. Do we ever leave behind anything completely in life? Or do we always hold some of it still? Therefore why would death be any different? The best time to fix our problems is while we are alive.

No matter your pain you can choose to view life as a gift and a joy. You are smart and that choice is always yours. You can make that choice and it can change the way you view life. It can help you. 

You can enjoy the days you don't have pain and the days you do have pain you will be able to deal with it better.

To the children in this sub. You are so smart. Your role models in life have failed you. Nobody has given you the tools needed to live life joyfully and purposefully. 

Stay open to everything but never have blind faith. Never accept what people tell you until your life experience shows you its true. Always question everything you are taught.

Love is your guide. Always trust love. Always let love for others and yourself guide you. And again don't believe anything I say, try it for yourself.",1
"My best friend checked into a mental hospital today, what can I do to help them?","Hi, title is pretty clear... My best friend checked into a mental hospital (in a different country) after a horrible experience that overfilled the glass. It's manic depression. Psychologists and psychiatrists are helping, their parents are helping but I don't know what I can do during this period. It's going to be a couple of months. Does anyone have any advice?",1
What should I do with my life?,"I'm 27 yrs old young and single man.I came out of depression about 3yrs ago and after that I came to Dubai for work.After coming here I struggled very hard each and every day of my life working 12hrs every week.Finally I got a nice job and continue working for almost 3months which will be coming this 30th November.But suddenly they informed me about a week ago that I need to leave the job.Now I have to go back my country and without the job,less savings and thinking about the situation of my family now again I am starting have the same feelings that I had 3yrs ago.I don't know what I should do and I don't have anyone here like before.I am fed up.",1

Over it,"I have nothing to be sad about yet, here I am. I love to work, I love to travel, I love to make money, but I always end up burning myself out trying to achieve everything at once.

I'm disappointed with my life. I wish I was happier. I wish I didn't know how the world worked so then I can live in complete ignorance. I really do envy people who do whatever they want without thinking of the consequences. I'm the type of person who has a plan C just in case the other two plans don't work out.

I have no expectations for anyone. It might sound fucked up but I just don't believe in anyone but myself. I'm happily married yet can't voice these opinions to anyone but strangers. I would rather die than let people know how I actually feel.

I'm tired of the fake ""you've got this"" or even ""take a rest, slow down"". I can't slow down. I can't take a rest. If I pause for even a day then I'll completely fall behind and can't accomplish everything I want to do. I'm honestly tired and over everything. 

I'm looking forward to the day I die since I won't have to worry anymore. Isn't that funny? The way some people can just nonchalantly talk about how they wanna die? I'm one of those people. I know people don't believe me but honestly, dying sounds absolutely liberating. I fucking hate life

I can’t say I blame them. I know that I am not perfect, I try my best to be there for others, but it’s almost impossible to have one of them reach out to me unless I have to spell it out that I need someone.

And I feel selfish for wanting that. I feel so much guilt for just wanting there to be someone to tell me that “you’re going to get through this.” And to actually listen to my struggles. Not “oh same” or “bless you.” 

I just want to know that my life had some significance in this world. That I actually have some meaning to exist and it not be as a bad example.

Quitting,"I (18 F) honestly feel like quitting and giving up. I’ve been skinny my entire life with an extremely quick metabolism. Suddenly I started gaining weight my senior year but I never really realized it until it was too late. Now I’m considered overweight and everything I eat reflects on my weight. I weigh more than most of my friends and my partner. I don’t weigh a crazy amount it’s still pretty manageable and I’ve lost 3 pounds recently from trying to manage it but honestly all of it is getting tiring. Watching my friends eat whatever they want without it reflecting on them, constantly having to turn down food to stay in a calorie deficit, watching my roommates just lay down in bed while I’m busting my ass off at the gym trying to lose the stomach I gained. All I see are skinny girls online and I constantly look at my old pictures when I was a 25 inch waist. Now I’m like a 28 inch waist in the span of a couple of months. I feel massive next to everyone but I also still appear skinny. It’s hard to explain, I think I’m developing body dysmorphia. The way the weight distributed is mostly in my legs but a little bit of it went into my stomach and that’s the main part bothering me. Also the fact that I went up like 4 pant sizes. It’s just incredibly frustrating. On top of that, I’m not adjusting well to college at all. I got diagnosed with new health problems which I’ve never dealt with before, am having trouble making new friends, and lost all my confidence that I gained in highschool. While I’m making all these changes, I still have to keep up with school and my grades which is a completely different ballpark from highschool. My ex best friend treated me badly so unfortunately I had to block her on everything. My other best friend moved to a far away college and honestly all of this change is not easy at all. I went through 2 bad breakups last school year near May and over the summer and I haven’t healed from that. My life just seems to be getting progressively worse. Everytime I go to the doctor I have a new medical issue that just makes my life harder. I just needed to rant, I’m going to try to make it out but honestly I don’t know. I know nobody is probably going to read this but that’s completely fine, I just needed to rant.",1

I don't know how I'm going to get through the night,"I've known a girl for 4 years now and when she left me, I was depressed, lost interest in life and had suicidal thoughts. Then I sought therapy and spent a year as an exchange student. Meanwhile she got together with the guy she cheated on me with and then she broke up with me coming back wanting me back. Now her dad and grandma are sick and she needed some distance from me, she's doing a lot with a friend, hasn't written to me for days, hasn't wanted to meet for almost 2 months. When I wrote to her today asking if she had feelings for him, she replied that she didn't know. She also didn't answer me when I asked her if she still wanted to see me and always used her dad's and grandma's illnesses as an excuse and said her boyfriend was just distracting her. But I'm now so broken by her behavior myself. But she doesn't answer me anymore. I can't take it anymore, I'm at the absolute end. I don't want to have such a bad depression again and I don't want to start from scratch again, I'm lying in bed and I could scream and cry at the same time, but I can't get any answers",1
I don't feel like doing anything,"I am going through the darkest depressive episode in my life. I am 38F, and within the past 6 months all important aspects of my life for me - career and family - have crumbled to the ground. I lost interest in my job, my spouse left me, I don't have kids as I have been struggling with infertility, my dad is dying of cancer. I live an isolated life as for a number of reasons I failed to establish meaningful friendships beyond that with my ex-husband. 

I go to work because I have to secure income to be able to pay rent and feed myself, but I don't enjoy my work and I have to really force myself get out of bed. During weekends when I don't have to go, I don't feel like doing anything. I haven't turned on my TV for 2 months now, I don't find interest in any book, any hobby, any sport. I don't want to join clubs and classes and I don't want to meet new people, platonically or romantically. I eat whatever to keep my body going, but I don't enjoy food and I am not interested in preparing a nice elaborate meal. I don't want to listen to music. I don't want to go for walks. I don't want to get pets. I can't think of anything meaningful to do. 

I just want to fall asleep and wake up in my old world where I had things to look forward to. I don't want to take medication. I have taken SSRIs in previous episodes, many kinds, but side effects were too much, for example, complete loss of sex drive and I had this weird and very creepy sensation of being out of my body. Experimenting with them was exhausting and the trial and error made me feel worse in a way. And now it is very different without these goals I am not motivated to heal. I don't know how to find this motivation and start to hope for and look forward to things again. 

All seems game over to me. I had years of no depression before between episodes but the only thing that kept me afloat is that I had some aspirations and goals to pursue, and importantly, a person to share these goals and joys of life with. Yes I am dependent, I was never able to feel whole and happy when on my own. When I am in a committed relationship I function well. But with older age it becomes more difficult to identify realistic significant goals like you know, starting a family, building a career. 

I know I have a lot of grief. I reached out to my doctor, they were supposed to call me back and set me up with a therapist but the office never did. I feel like the healthcare system (US) is failing me as despite having a good insurance I am not getting help. I barely got myself to make the first call and I just can't get myself to call again and follow up, and there will be waiting again, and I just don't want to go through this torture. I've never seen a therapist who was useful actually anyway. Last time when I got out of depression is not because a therapist helped me, but when me and my partner decided to start trying for kids, so I suddenly had something to work on and look forward to. 

I am writing this to pass the time, really, I don't have a question. ",1
I’m so tired,"I am not in danger. I will not kill myself. But I’m just so tired.

I’m a sixteen year old girl and I’ve made two attempts on my life - one at age twelve and another at age fourteen. Before my first attempt, I had been suicidal since I was around ten (give or take). So, in short, I’ve been battling depression for about half of my life.

I know people care for me and they will be sad if I am gone, especially by suicide. My first attempt, when my mother visited me in the psych ward, she said that she saw my violin case and all of my things and it made her incredibly emotional. She said that she wouldn’t know what to do if I succeeded. That’s why I don’t think I will kill my self, at least I would wait until after she is gone.

I just don’t know how I can live into adulthood. I’m lazy. I don’t do my homework. I have no motivation to do anything. I just sit at home in bed or play games on my computer. I see my manager talking about the other kids my age and how they’re working eight hour shifts, on top of other jobs and school, and I just feel so ashamed. I see the other kids with good grades and doing work outside of school. I’m fat at BMI 26.4. I can’t do anything ever. I drain the money from my mother because I require so much therapy and medication, for what?

I just feel like everything would be better if I didn’t exist. I’m tired of fighting. I can’t even do the bare minimum without exhaustion. I’m tired of being depressed. I wish I could just stop being a lazy tub of lard and do something except mope around all day.",1

Not sure what do to,"Hi. I'm new here and well 
I am not sure what to do. 
I know I should seek help but not motivated to do so. 
A quick run down
I'm female (29) I have Suffered from ED in the past. I am severely depressed, high anxiety and have frequent panic attacks due to my job.

My job makes me want to kill myself EVERYDAY, so much so that I started SH to cope.
I'm starting to think I won't make it to the end of December at this rate. 

I know I should get therapy but just the thought of cycling through therapist after therapist drains me and makes me wonder if I'm even worth saving or I should just continue as I am.

The small enjoyment I get is from a mobile game. It's sad I know. But just the thought of me finally getting a new unit of my favorite character keeps me going.

This mobile game means a lot to me as it's been my comfort since I lost my vision in one eye temporarily, (it's healed now after 3 months) and due to that I've had to use my credit card to pay for a lot of expenses  because my jobs disability did not kick in on time. (lots of trauma there)  so my credit card bill is high which also doesn't help my financial anxiety. I was never compensated.

I just really want to know what should I do?!
I feel like I cannot talk to anyone about my problems for fear of judgement or being sent away to treatment or crazy house.
Since depression seems to be joke to both my job and most people around me. The last thing someone wants to hear is ""I wish I were dead.""

I am unable to quit this hell hole as it helps sustain my living situations in my town and is the only job paying me enough to make a living here with all the bills I have to pay now. along with my student loan on top of that too.

I’m really scared right now,"So this just happened, I was literally just woken up by my stepdad at around 4:30 this morning. He told me he and my mom were going to take my grandma to the hospital.

I’m worried about my grandma, and I’m scared because of the conditions of the road. It snowed here this Friday and I have a lot of bad memories driving in weather like this, and I can’t help thinking of every possible thing that could go wrong. I’m so sorry if this is not the place to post right now, I’m just afraid and needed to vent to people that I can relate with. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this, I just want to know everything will be okay, but I’m scared to lose my family.",1
37/F and in a dark place. Keep getting sucked into a hole. Not sure how it gets better.,"I’ll start by saying I’ve done some things to pull myself out of feeling so bad. In 2019, things were dire. I was badly in debt, in a job I hate, and recovering from the breakup of a 3 year relationship where in the final 6months of it was treated very dismissively and poorly by my then partner rather than him doing me the kindness of breaking up with me. The split happened at the start of 2019, and he spent many months since inveigeling himself into what was my friendship group and effectively charming them all into being his friend, to the point that they’ve had friendship activities that have excluded me. It’s felt with some of my now ex-friends as though our friendship’s been conditional on it being ok for my ex to be in group situations with us and it’s been tough.

I was on a path in 2020 towards putting this all behind me. Enrolled on a Masters degree related to the career I wanted, potentially moving to my uni city but for lockdowns keeping me in the city I live in (still now), making new friends, etc. However, different things went wrong. I couldn’t afford to move city owing to continuing debt and wasn’t having luck with changing job, so it was arranged at last minute for me to stay with my employer and continue working for them on a part time basis whilst studying remotely(successive lockdowns meant this was happening anyway).

Cut to two years later when I would’ve otherwise expected to finish my final assignments. I had two left to do. Two stressful things happened in very quick succession. Firstly, in June 2022 my apartment was taken on by a new landlord who made it clear that we would all be served with section 21 notices of eviction (as is known in the U.K. - they call them “no fault” eviction notices and the term to get us to bugger off is two months). I jumped before I was pushed and moved in with a friend for 10months. In August 2022, it then transpired that my employer had put me on the wrong contract for the start of my part time employment with them during my uni course, and had overpaid me for two years - and my manager and the HR manager tried effectively to blame me wholly for a situation they were equally responsible for spotting sooner. Long story short, I’m effectively in indentured servitude working for them for longer than I ever wanted, in order to pay them back, and it’s killing me inside. I’m lucky to have a good team and a much more supportive line manager, else I’d be much worse than I am - but I am still struggling.

Effectively, I’ve been sinking back into depression annd anxiety. I know I am. I feel like when I'm 39 and free of this bullshit from my job like no other employer in the field I want to work in will have me over some 20-something hot shot who has had the time and energy to advance their skills and expertise in the things they need. I’ll have nothing left to give of myself. I’m fortunate right now to have a loving, wonderful partner (and dog) and frankly they are both key reasons I’ve not ended my life at this point, but I know I cannot rely on them for my self worth. It’s otherwise totally in the toilet. I worry it will only get worse for me here and fear I will have nothing to offer the world, my loved ones or myself. I’ve fallen so short of my own standards for myself and can’t see a way up and out.",1
Struggling with meaninglessness and death anxiety,"Gonna start this off by saying I know this isn’t a unique viewpoint at all, that it’s one that’s actually not entirely uncommon among people my age, etc, but I still want to get it off my chest and hear thoughts from others. Warning: it is very long.

I’m 21 and in college and in the last few months have begun suffering from constant, pervasive death anxiety that has led to me becoming depressed, and seriously reckoning with mental health really for the first time in my life. I’m seeing therapy and trying out medications but so far have not found any meaningful relief.

I don’t say this to brag, but I am, and have always been a very philosophical, cerebral, intellectual-oriented person, and that’s what has driven me to my current situation. I read a lot about religious studies and mythology, because that stuff is extremely interesting to me, but a huge component of religious belief is beliefs about death, afterlife, soul, reasons for humanity’s existence, etc. I’ve been an atheist since middle school and previously found myself very comfortable with my views, but for some reason reading so much about the topic of religion - specifically with the thought that *every one of them is wrong* in mind - gave me what I would call an existential crisis, because it really impressed upon me in a way I’ve never felt before that *holy shit, death is the end and we really aren’t here for any reason at all*. And to me that’s horrifying.

The problem isn’t that death feels like an escape, as I see is posted a lot on this subreddit, but the exact opposite: I *like* being alive, that’s why I’m *terrified* of dying. I like the college I’m at, and am interested in the things I am learning. I have great friends who I like spending time with and can count on to be there for me. There are passions and pastimes I get enjoyment out of and want to keep doing. This just makes me feel like *I have so much to lose by dying*.

I had previously felt, quite securely, that many old adages about death were true: that there’s no reason to fear death because I was dead for 13.8 billion years and wasn’t bothered by it and since won’t be bothered by it after I’m dead either, that I’ll never really live if I’m afraid of dying, etc. Carpe diem. Memento Mori. In essence: that death is nothing to me because death is itself an imperceptible state of unconsciousness.

But now, that feels like a threat, a permanent and total annihilation of my self, which nullifies all meaning in life. If death is inevitable, and it is the end, then what’s the point of anything? It’s one thing to believe that I can make a mark on the world, that I can contribute in some way to the progress of humanity, but progress is a myth, and humanity itself is doomed.

Nothing lasts, everyone who lives will die, humanity is a random cosmic fluke, the Sun will eventually blow up the earth if we don’t drive ourselves extinct first, the final end state of the universe is probably eternal nothingness in which literally nothing can ever happen again. The very notion that one’s brain can randomly suffer from a genetic chemical imbalance that alters their ability to think and feel is itself so absurd. The thought that the universe is indifferent to us is so crushing, like a cruel truth we were never meant to know, the most sick joke ever played.

Even if I do have a soul and there is a heaven, I don’t want to be a disembodied soul! I don’t want to spend eternity in endless bliss in union with God or something! I want to be *here*, in this world, with these people I love, without having to worry about our bodies crumbling away or our planet dying. Immortality isn’t an option we have, and even if we had that, unless we outline many precise conditions for it, it would also become unbearable. So there is no good option. Eternal life is bad and death is bad. The universe set us up to lose.

I know it’s pointless, but I can’t help but wonder about it: Why did I have to be born in the period of human history where we knew these harsh realities, when instead I could have been born somewhen, somewhere else with greater religiosity, and I would be able to indulge the wishful thinking of afterlives, divine cosmic purpose, a meaning for suffering? No, I have to live in “modernity”, when not only is capitalism making people miserable and killing the planet and I can’t do anything about it, but I have to reconcile with modern science’s bitter truths. I never asked to be born, let alone in this time and place, and so surely I never asked to deal with this wretched fucking human condition.

I know, on an intuitive level, that I don’t have to feel this way, that I can be happy even though I know I’m gonna die, which most other people, including other atheists, seem to be capable of. But even when I think of living the ideal of a long, happy, and successful life, in which I achieved my life goals, have no regrets, cultivated a lasting legacy, can die happy, even then, I will still have to age, and wither, and *die*, and there’s nothing I can do about it.

And that assumes I even get that far; people say “you are so young! You have so much time!” And all I can feel is *you don’t know that*. Random chance, no matter how unlikely, can cut my life short at any time. I’m not even guaranteed 80 years of life! I could get cancer in my 50s or get hit by a car in a week. Even so, the notion that I’m young and therefore shouldn’t be worrying about death - indeed, wasting my finite time - isn’t particularly helpful either; punting the problem down the road to suffer over it later doesn’t exactly resolve it!

I had previously committed myself to existential nihilism and existentialism’s response to it, that is, that none of us are born for any intrinsic purpose or divine plan and that we must find and make our own meaning. That felt freeing, self-determining. But now I just feel like, isn’t that subjective meaning illusory, a product of our stupid animal brains connecting dots where there aren’t any to trick itself into feeling better? I have even been trying to look back into spirituality and faith to feel better, but there’s always the voice in the back of my head that says, you know this is irrational, you know you cannot fool yourself into believing any of this, no matter how much you want to.

In school, I read all about theories in disciplines that claim that pretty much everything is arbitrary: one of the fundamental ideas of linguistics is that all language, all communication at all, is arbitrary; anthropological theory says, cultures are merely social constructions invented to serve biological functions; psychology says, evolutionary biology explains largely how our brains work, including religious experience. Of course, postmodern theory even posits that there is no such thing as fixed, non-arbitrarily filtered or expressed truth at all! That’s all there is, evolution wants us to keep making babies over and over, we’re not here for any other reason and that’s all our bodies are designed to do, ultimately. If you strip all of these things down, what am I left with that’s real? *Nothing*. How do I even know *anything* is real? Nothing means anything.

And I know, on some level, that I don’t really believe this, otherwise, why would I enjoy my life enough to not want it to end? There are still things I want to do, feel, accomplish: I want to write and find success as an author, learn so much more about the topics I’m interested in, consume more art and play more video games, spend more time with my loved ones, see more of the world, experience the love of finding a romantic life partner, fuck, I’m a virgin and I want to know what sex feels like! But I fear that all of these desires are insignificant to the universe, stupid evolutionary instincts, arbitrary illusions I only value because of the culture I was raised in and therefore meaningless, and most of all, that I won’t have enough time to do them, enough time, in the most literal sense, being my Self.

And therein lies the paradox of it all, I do think life is worth living, but my fear of death and nihilism are destroying my will to live, and I don’t know how to claw my way out of this contradiction yet.

I just needed to get all of this off my chest in a space outside of therapy. I don’t know what kind of responses I’m hoping to get from people by posting here.",1
Am I depressed? and kind of a rant 22M,"Early this year my uncle committed suicide, a week after that my grandpa died too. Few months after I got into a work related accident and was bed bound for two months, and now about 2 months ago my girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me.

Ever since then I have been feeling depressed, Its not as bad as other posts I see here, so I am not even sure if its depression, I still go to work, I still get up from bed, shower and brush my teeth and all that. But I hate the things and hobbies I used to do before, I cant help but think about sad things, I cant help but feel alone. I dont wanna hurt myself or kill myself I just want someone to talk to and spend time with, thats the only way I can really get my mind off of things.

Problem is Im an introvert and I dont really have lots of friends especially IRL ones, i have a bunch of friends online but its not the same. I just feel so incredibly lonely and I dont wanna do anything anymore. I feel like the friends I currently have are tired of me complaining about how shit I feel and I am trying to make new friends but its a slow process. I used to hate going to work and would look forward to going home, but now work atleast partially keeps me busy, now its the weekends that are giving me trouble because I just have nothing to do. I have no friends, the hobbies I used to enjoy I dont enjoy, I cant focus on anything besides sad thoughts.  


I also think ill never find another person I can connect with as much as I have with my previous girlfriend, how can I when I cant even make friends in the first place.",1
I think someone else can live my life better than me,"It’s been such a wild ride lately. I really desperately want to exchange my life with someone cuz I know they’d be so good at it. 
They’ll take everything I have, make it their own and flourish. Don’t ask me how, I just know that someone underprivileged can live really well in my place. I’m so ungrateful I tried to mix my medications but unfortunately I can’t OD since I miscalculated the meds again lmao.. it wasn’t bad, I threw it all up. It’s been a while since I actually pulled something like this lol but thennnn.. I got to get drunk! My stomach is killing me rn but I feel somehow more sane too. 

I realised there’s nobody I can actually talk these things about anymore cuz as I said. Someone else can do well in my life, it’s just me who can’t figure it out. I’m the one who’s stuck, anybody else would’ve lived a happy life so far in. They would’ve done better and been better but I just suck like that so I can’t. But I need to tell someone. I’m self centred afterall, I have to crib about being hurt, emotionally and cry about how things don’t go my way. Just awful and ungrateful as a person like that yk? 

Anyway, saw today. Will see tomorrow. I’m not religious but I pray for death more than a better life. Nothings wrong with me, I just suck at living. It’s no biggie, I just tire people out and frustrate them by being sad and pessimistic is all.. really. I even had Starbucks this morning after throwing up cuz my mouth tasted horrible but it’s okay, everything is okay. I’m just going to disappear soon, then some random person can take my place and nobody will realise, it’ll be perfect",1
I don’t deserve to complain,"I know a bunch of people that went through so much more than me. And they still get up every morning. Doing whatever needs to be done. That’s why I don’t even feel like talking about what I’m going through. Because those people will think that I’m complaining about the smallest things but to me these “small things” are very hard. They’re exhausting. Every morning I wake up feeling like I should just give up. 
I don’t have people around me who truly seem to understand what I’m saying and truly care. It’s so hard feeling like you need to do everything by yourself. I’m way too weak for this world. 
I tried reaching out to a friend when I was having too many negative thoughts and they just turned it into a joke… idk what im supposed to do.",1
Struggling to find useful counselling/help,"I'm in my second major run of depression, diagnosed and back on antidepressants. Have tried very hard to follow advice of CBT literature, and engaged with journaling and regular exercise, but the overall feeling leaves me with a feeling of ruminating and self-obsession. Through GP had series of webinars that didn't feel like they taught me anything I'd not tried before.

The feeling and weight of not wanting to get up, to carry on, to have the effort of each day is palpable. It's only obligations to others, and the feeling of not wanting to let down people that stops me from withdrawing completely.

Although financially perhaps not something I should be looking at (cost of living being what it is) I've tried private counselling, but finding people who are similar enough to me that I feel I can have some rapport is difficult. Without wanting to sound sweeping and possibly sexist, a lot of the local counselors I can fine are older women - and my experiences haven't been great.  My best progress was with a similarly aged guy to me.  But he died of covid, and left me feeling somewhat adrift.

Issues around my feelings of self worth and questioning if I actually add anything positive to the world dominate my thoughts.  And even a passing unprompted ""thank you"" can be enough to move me to tears.

I need to find a path out of this.  Whilst not suicidal, I do question the long term sustainability of my situation. I'm existing at times, not living, and feel devoid of joy.

Meditation, medication, mindfulness, and behavioural action plans don't seem to be changing things. And I feel a lack of joy in things I used to love. I want to be a better person for the perks around me that I care about, not a joy sponge who is the shell of a person.

(Suffered loss of parents - one recently, suicide of ex, and period of self loathing in relatively short space of time. Want to feel like a person who is making the lives of those he cares for better, not worse. Sick of being a burden to those he loves). 

Probably no quick fixes, but maybe there are things I've not thought of. UK if that makes any difference.",1
life’s hard man,i’m a 20M i don’t know if i’m dealing with depression i won’t diagnose myself wit it but i do feel hopeless with everything nothing is fun anymore i always question myself is this rlly worth it ? i want to take my life but i’m scared to hurt my family nd i’m scared to be alone after death,1
"I recognize the problem, theoretically, I know how to help the problem, but I just can't be bothered","I, 23F, have been diagnosed with MDD for 3 years now. I've been in therapy, with plenty of doctors, and a decent support system. Obviously, anyone can be affected by depression, but I have found that the younger generations are aware of the whys and how we could fix it, there's just no feasible way to do so. 

I'm in college, I'm in a weird relationship, I live in a rough home still. I know how I can fix each of those things that would help my mental health, but I can't in this economy. In this day and age, there's no way for me to actually help myself. There's nothing to look forward to, there's no affordable way to put myself and my needs first. We have access to information on mental health but not on any ways to actually fix or help it. 

And the holidays are hard. I know I don't like celebrating them much anymore. So many bad things happen during them that just the time of year alone gets me down and in a bad place while everyone around me is ""getting in the spirit"". I'll never understand how someone can actually be a fully functioning human. I have all the resources on how to be but can't. I've zero interest in anything and so I do literally nothing but doom scroll all day and I feel horrible for it. I keep thinking ""when I grow up, it'll be better"" but how can it be? There's definitely things I want to achieve, but it just seems so impossible sometimes. ",1
I hate everything about myself,"I hate I can't even get myself up in the morning, I hate I have sleep apneia, I hate I have asthma, I hate I get angry so quick, I hate I make everything awkward, I hate the fact that Im lazy and cant even keep my own room clean. I hate the fact that I say the wrong thing at the wrong time. I hate the fact I can't even stand up to my mother when shes being a bitch, I hate that Im so fat (like seriously I weigh 300 pounds) I hate that all my interests are considered ""weird"". I hate that I get obsessive over fucking fictional charecters. I hate that I can't even talk to a girl. I just fucking hate every last goddamn thing about me. ",1

I Want To Do Fun Things but I Struggle To Actually Do Them,"Does anyone else struggle to pick up hobbies? I have this thing where I am hesitant (?) to start new things. I don't even start new tv shows. I want to pick up my knitting and play video games but the hesitation or whatever keeps me from actually going through with picking them up. So I end up scrolling on my phone endlessly. I feel absolutely ridiculous that I struggle with this.

So tired of everything.,Im so tired of being in constant pain. It slows me down so much I just want to cry all the time. I feel bad for everyone around me. My thoughts are getting worse again. Im so sorry to my love.,1
What am I doing,"It does not matter how hard I try to do anything nothing changes. people always looked down on. My childhood was shit I had no friends everyone looked down on me treated me like a shit so I isolated myself. It does not matter how hard I try to study everyone still thinks I'm dumb, I can't comunicate. Everytime my coursemates get offers to participate in projects and then here I am pushing everywhere I can. I get ridiculed laughed at and I still try to do something. I hate this world I would rather live like I did in a small house alone and keep playing video games and eating shit and not doing anything than dealing with my shitty life and at this point I want to give up I don't know why am I forced to live my life like this.

Success stories of overcoming anxiety/ depression,"Hey everyone, I have been experiencing the worst anxiety/ depression since August when I caught the flu. My symptoms are physical too, I have muscle pain, fatigue and overall not motivated, have been taking a 2 week off from work to rest and recover and tmw will be my day back and I still feel the same :( It has taken a toll in every area of my life.

"I feel, I’m the failure factor","For the past 4 to 5 no six months I have been feeling my IQ drop gradually. I joined a very very bad college because I had no other option, road learning is rampant there and I haven’t found anyone to talk to about my interest like books, formula, 1 other things, I feel that whenever I do something or try to do something it will end failure.

Like 2 to 3 months ago, I entered Formula One as a fan and the team I am sharing for is continually getting worse and worse and worse. I have been exercising for two weeks straight, but don’t feel any noticeable or any small improvement. My sleep pattern is all over the place because I can’t sleep due to these starts. I feel anything I try to do want to do or will do is going to end in failure because I am the unknowingly knowingly. When I got aware of my families financial, they went downhill when I got confident about my driving skills I crashed when I got confident about my learning skills. I failed or almost failed in two or more subjects.

Even now I think I have lost all my skins. I just turned it in yet, yet I am not running and whatever I want through internship and shit is so make it that it cannot even classify us income for me.

I really want to aim for the moon but I don’t think my failure ass will reach the sea level",1
Self-forgiveness,"I can’t forgive myself for how I lived my life.
So self-centered, lazy, passive, passionless,..

I truly believe I’m a sinner. Not necessarily in the religious sense (although a lot of religious thoughts are going through my head), but towards the world, others and me.

There‘s something like a law of the universe, I think. It’s about the balance between giving and taking. So far, I’ve been taking and taking and taking. I feel so bad about it that I can’t put it into words properly.
Paradoxically, by putting an end to my existence, I would take even more (to make myself stop taking, at least?!).

Best wishes to all of you.",1
"Is this normal to feel so sad and hopeless after ending a relationship, moving into a new city and starting a new job all by myself at 32?","Hi everyone, tldr;  
  
I'm a 32 year old male who got out of a 6 year relationship 13 months ago, live in the NYC area. I'm a smart guy, and have a decent job, pretty good looking and live by myself. Here's my story: I grew up in a middle class home on Long Island, but near the city. My parents always worked, and I had friends, and the usual experience growing up with friends, etc.  
  
In college, I stayed local, and partied a lot, it took me around 7 years to graduate instead of 4, but somehow I graduated with a Computer Science degree. I didnt go away to school, but rather worked my way through school. I had friends, and worked a job, but was less ""Privileged"" per se than my peers around me, who were lucky enough to go to school away.  
  
I met the first love of my life at around age 20, and we dated for four years through college. She left me after four years for another guy, which really stung. I was in a dark period in my life, living at home, almost done with school, it was a rough summer. I met my ex girlfriend in August of 2015, we dated for a long time. In May of 2016, I got into a bad car accident that was close to taking my life, but thankfully, I survived it. Unfortunately, we broke up in August of that year, but we reunited in 2017.  
  
In 2018 I finally graduated college, and found that I tended to do much better in the workforce than I ever did in school. I got a job at a bank doing IT and I worked my way up from $45,000 a year to $110,000 a year in 4 years. I worked this job, and lived with my ex girlfriend for around three years. Unfortunately at this time, I started gambling and lost some money, and ultimately after a long time dating her, she left me. I was devastated, literally dating this girl from age 24/25 to age 31.  
  
Here I was 13 months ago, almost broke, forced to move back in with my parents. I started paying down my debt, and I started dating a girl, who I had really really intense feelings for. We got into a ""situationship"" for around 4 months, before she left me on Valentines day of last year. I also started doing a lot of self care during this time, such as working out, eating clean, I got some muscle for the first time in my life after hitting the gym almost daily which felt incredible, and found that it was getting pretty easy to get matches on dating apps.  
  
I went a step further, and in March of this year, wanting a career boost, got a job at a Hedge Fund in NYC, levering the NYC pay to my advantage. I got a job at one with a $140,000 a year salary, which is great for a single guy and been employed there since. In July of this year, I moved near the city, into a small, but spacious, non luxury one bedroom apartment.  
  
All of my friends live back home, and I'm far away from them, so fairly isolated. I traveled to California and did a west coast tour by myself this summer which was incredible. My job also is fairly solid. However, at the age of 32, after multiple situationships since my last relationship, I feel stuck in life, unsure where I'm going, like I have no purpose, and like a pure failure.  
  
I'm lonely, I have no friends that I know, I literally moved to a new city on the outskirts of NYC, and I'm not really involved in the social crowds. I go out to work at 5:30 in the morning, come home at 6PM at night after busting my ass all day, go to the gym sometimes, then open up dating apps, to get hot matches often, but most of the conversations end up no where, while I do get dates, and have gotten laid a lot this summer, I feel empty.  
  
I feel almost like I dont know how to make new male friends, my old identity is completely wiped away, and I feel sad on the inside. I feel alone, burnt out, disgusted with life, and like I should have a house by now. Instead, i""m working a fairly decent job paying off debt, which I'll be done paying off in about 12 months. While I get dates on dating apps, there's lots of ghosting, attractive women frequently randomly ghost even after good banter and I literally know no one where I live.  
  
is this normal? I feel like my identity is completely shattered, like I do not even know who I am anymore. I feell like I am living to go to work, make money, pay off my debt slowly, get laid once or twice a month, and go to the gym, like a hamster on a wheel just rinse, recycling and repeating.  
  
I also have met some nice girls despite all the ghosting on dating apps, but I feel like i'm emotionally paralyzed, almost like I'm permanently ""emotionally unavailable"" from getting fcked over by life.  
  
I'm not trying to cause a pity party for my self, I just feel disgusted with myself and with my life. I feel like it's possible of course that I may have depression ,but its hard to tell if its from my environment, my genetics or both. Im going to see a doctor to address it regardless, and I'll keep working out.  
  
Has anyone ever felt like me? I feel lost, alone, like I""m just going through the motions of life, like I'll never find the love of my life again, and like I'm just wasting my existence on the outskirts of NYC to be a worker bee to get drunk one night a weekend and get laid then do it all over again.  
  
I know things need to change. I just don't know where to start first. I feel completely lost. Thanks for listening.",1
I'm tired of hating myself... height... weight I'm popping benzos to be in I don't care land,"34 male who has either some form of extreme low self esteem, body dismophia or possibly OCD. I hate being 5'7 and I'm stalky 25 pounds overweight.... I'm popping benzos to just not care I've bee on them for 7 years so I know I'm already dependent. I don't take a crazy high dose but moderate like 3mg Ativan a day. Bah I can't stop obsessing over my looks. Been doing it for 15 years. Only thing that helped was medication which has stopped working now meh I pop benzos. I wish I could have my legs broke to grow an inch and a half or I could get my hands on steroids and who knows squeeze an extra inch out myself.... I hate life. I. So drained, can't work, live in this as$hole neighborhood with thieves and addicts and yah.... I just wait around all day no gears are turning into my head I've totally been numb with depression",1
25M - Need advice on how to live life,"I'm 25M looking for some advice or to talk with someone who could offer me perspectives to better view things objectively or turn my view up.
Currently I'm dealing with some bit of depression and emotional numbness. I'm seeking professional help but wanted some bit of real advice, perhaps from older people.

Depression for me is likely effect of my circumstances I've built around myself rather than be the cause for them. I'd be hard pressed to acknowledge otherwise.

I have generally quite low self esteem, I've lived a mindless life and continue to do so. But I've been aware that it's just going to cause suffering. I can't justify the way I've lived or am living. Because its a blind day to day living of procastination on life. I can't trust myself or the way of life I'm living or if I don't change.

I don't quite have a sense of self or emotional response or personality. But even than I have this assumption that I don't need all those, because I'll still be living wrongly. I don't feel like I know how to live as a human correctly or feel lesser than others.

A big reason for alot of these things is me living in an isolated manner or vaccum.
Which means I don't quite know how other people my age are living or in general how other people live there lives or how people are.
I'm not 'learning' or 'growing' as I age. Parts of me feel the same as I was few years ago, likely because I've not really processed what it means to be me or what I'm doing.

My value, social value, ability in real life, ability to have interpersonal relationships, looks, personality all is below average I'd say.
More importantly I'm continuing to do a blind run of my life, which means my disaster management abilities or transitioning into different phases of life or tackling different scenarios by myself is weak.

All these are a life lesson I should've learned with my experience in college. Which should've been an opportunity to learn how to live from others. But instead i self isolated and at the end it became a shame for me. Because i didn't help myself.

I can't give myself happiness or adventure, I can't rely on myself or the person who's living my life (me). He's living in a comfortable bubble which isn't too comfortable anymore.
Unable to face that reality probably, I live in a dissociative manner disconnected from myself and my emotions.

In reality it all just seems like an escape and my lack of taking responsibility of my own life. I need to parent myself but I continue to neglect and waste time.

I may sound being hard on myself, while it may be true. I can't quite self love if I don't move forward (whatever that may mean).

I don't feel like my own age or the fact that I was a teen or young adult because of loner way of living. I generally feel shame for that.

All this is likely me being harsh on myself, but I don't quite want to self love this person.
Neither do I know what I'll do that'll tackle the shame, but probably when some things change maybe I'll be able to view it from different perspective.",1
im so fucking sorry,i keep fucking up im getting worse and im fucking up. I was cutting myself so I showered to get the blood off. and I was messaging my best friend and I sent her a picture of it. she says she loves me and not to do that but asked that I dont send any pictures like that anymore because it makes her upset. I didnt even fucking think of it and now i just feel so much worse I keep making pain theres no end to all this i cant think properly everyone probably hates me and i want out,1
My dad said laziness and depression is the same thing,"Laziness may be the wrong word. He keeps complaining to me how annoying his colleagues are at work and he don't want that anymore. He has absolutely no worries. Today at the table he told me being lazy and having depression is the same, or he have it worse. I don't think he have a daily battle in his mind of how to survive the week or weeks till the next holiday. AND EVEN THEN. The battle isn't over then. It just keeps going. He just wants at least a longer weekend to recover from work. People with depression never have a break! It's exhausting to hear him whines 24/7 but tell ME I shouldn't act like that..",1
Why does it not get better?,"Not even being dramatic the depression hasn’t stopped it’s been 6 years of this shit. It’s something we all have to live with I guess, I feel so out of touch because the depression has dragged me down into another realm. Fuck this illness it’s no joke. Fuck anyone who doesn’t take this illness seriously.",1
"So I'm tired of the constant nightmares, so very tired..","it's rare that I sleep for more than a hour or two hours at once. even more rare is that I sleep in total for more than a few a night.

every night it's usually the same. dreams about either my somewhat recently deceased father, or one of the few girls that completely broke my heart. I can feel myself crying/hyperventilating/having a straight up anxiety attack in the dream and wake up in a panicked state covered by cold sweats and out of breath. It's almost physically painful while I'm asleep. I can't even really describe the feeling other than it's one of the worst I have ever experienced 

the dreams are never the same, only the stars of the show if you will. and it's very taxing on my psyche. besides the obvious reason of lack of sleep it's a terrible way to start my morning and this is most mornings. usually I'll wake up at 3am and just dont even want to try to go back to sleep for fear of being sent right back into where ever I just was in my mind

it makes moving on and getting over past trauma extremely difficult and I don't know if there is anything I can do. it's been happening non stop for a couple of years now and shows no signs of slowing down. can I do anything? is this just my life now?

I have no idea if it's common. I don't like to talk to people about it as I don't really have anyone that would want to care to heard about it so advice and comfort and/or understanding are non existent. I just have to try my best to shake it off and go on with my day with but it's difficult and I seriously doubt very healthy as I'm basically just bottling up all these things that will eventually just explode outwards

how often does this happen to other people? is there anything I can do? I just want to move on from these things, live my life somewhat normally and most of all.. be able to enjoy my favorite activity again. sleeping and dreaming of better places than this one. I want my life back but that's not going to happen so I need to be able to move passed my past and find what my new one has in store

Happiness never lasts,"I thought everything was getting better a few days ago but here i am crying my eyes out again, why do i even bother trying anymore i want this to end i physically feel pain in my chest because of sad i am im cannot stop sobbing rn what’s the point of living if im gonna be like this forever",1
I don't know what to do,"Hi, so I have this problem like I need to work rn but from sometimes it's getting difficult to do, and relaxing and other tips on internet is not helping.  From the moment I wake up everyday I feel this tention in head my heart beat is fast and beating in my ears and it's just so tense. It's difficult to do anything due to which I waste my half day trying to be calm and concentrate on my work. 
I m getting more anxious  because im not doing my work and I often find myself dwelling in negative thoughts and end up crying . It feels like a repetitive cycle. 

It would be helpful if someone can tell me how to fix it",1
I Just Want Friends Like Me,"I have lived for 2 decades. I just want friends who are like me in terns of likes, interests, and personality. Like, seriously? There are 7 billion or whatever people in this world yet I never met someone like that. It's so hard to believe. And I prayed to god for such a friend yet nothing happened. I'm so tired!",1
Relationship,"Hey guys. Its not me who has depression but my bf for quite a while. He became very distant and we barely chat or meet. Even if we do, its me who starts the conversation. I know he is hurt, and it hurts me too. I doubt that i will leave him but its been draining me seeing other friends in a happily relationships and so on. I know he would be grateful if I would wait, but I am not sure if i can or is it right to do…I am just so lost i want to go to magicians or something to guide me what to do because its only my decision… What should I do??",1
Just venting,I can’t take the shouting and insults anymore. I rarely drink and I’ve been wanting to get drunk every night just so I could make the pain stop (but I haven’t). I think about ending it all the time now. No one around me cares and I don’t know what it is about me that makes me so worthless and disposable. I genuinely wish someone would just tell me to my face because being ignored hurts so much.,1
Tired,"Just woke up, the kids are are already up and running around, I’m wondering why I feel so empty and with out purpose this morning, if my being alive will mean anything or hold any significance. I don’t if I’m depressed cause of where I am at in life right now work, marriage, and kids but I just don’t feel right",1
Medication? I need some help please,"I’ve suffered from depression/anxiety since my early teens and I’m now getting towards 40.

I’ve done everything, different therapies, living ‘right’ (the exercise bs) and it persists. Psychotherapy is the only thing that at least made me feel more comfortable in myself but also makes me feel like I’m going crazy.

I’ve tried 3 different ssris and they make me feel nothing to the point where it starts to feel scary. I prefer to at least feel sad which ties me to something.

My life on paper is fine, I’m lucky.

Is there any medication that is good for persistent depression? To give me some kind of ‘spark’ to work from?  I heard things about Wellbutrin but I’m worried about anything ‘stimulant’ because my mum died of a heart attack. I heard things about ketamine but I’m not sure if it’s a long lasting fix.",1
I keep wanting to make the change but I keep failing,"I’m tired of feeling this way. I have so many dreams and aspirations. Sometimes I wish I didnt have them because it reminds me how low I really am, how impossible they feel. I want to get away, get out of this feeling so badly… but instead it’s easier for me to lay in bed, sit at my computer, wasting the time away not working toward the things I want. And I suffer for it. Whether it’s procrastinating, binge drinking, any form of escapism possible I take it.

Life is just passing me by. And I’m ready to catch up with it. But the battle within my mind is one that feels impossible to win.

I just needed to put this out there, maybe this resonates with someone.",1
I think it's back or getting bad again,"I've been on medication for a while now and my doctor lowered my dose after showing signs of improvement. I actually felt better and think I got back on track. My grades improved from an F to an A, studying took little to no effort to do. I'd gladly do it at the first thought of doing it. Chores were a breeze. I was happier and more positive, the harmful thoughts were absent for a while but now they're back and I can't even think of a good reason why. No major negative event happened and I believe I'm handling stressful moments better... Im not as productive as I was a month ago... I want that productive phase back. Makes me question whether it's really depression alone or am I actually bipolar?",1

Ive worked at fucking retail since I left highschool and I don’t even have a car or know how to drive. I have no desires in life or aspirations. I’m depressed, suicidal, and alone. I don’t know what to do in life and the smallest failure I cause sends me spiraling down. I’m living check to check in a studio apartment with someone I don’t even know if I love…everything feels pointless. I hate my relationship, I hate my job, I hate my existence, I hate fucking waking up in the morning. I’d kill myself if I wasn’t so afraid of dying. I want the pain to stop. I want someone to help me. I want out of this hell…I’m just scared all the time. Scared if I’m doing the right thing or making the right choice…I just want something to go right he for me in life.

"I don't know how to improve my life, i am hopeless","I am 23 years old, a med student. I have been depressed since the high school, with periods of improved state. Currently i am in a depressive episode for more than 2 months(being dumped was the trigger). So far i have tried Cymbalta, Lexapro, Zoloft and nothing seems to work. Currently i am on a combination of Zoloft and Mirtazapine.  I have suicidal thoughts here and then not because i hate my life but because i feel so low all the time. I really miss my ex(who was narcissistic and i am really better off without him, but i feel like i felt more alive while i was with him). I am tired of living my life on auto-pilot. My family doesn't understand my mental state and i feel so lonely. I have friends but i don't enjoy hanging out with anyone bc all i can think about is my ex. I can't focus on my studies because my mind keeps wandering off. I tried working out but it didn't improve my mood at all. Since my childhood i've wanted to be a doctor, and now i can't even study at all. I also have anxiety and do a lot of catastrophizing. I feel like i am never gonna meet my soulmate.",1
I have nothing left,"I am 29(M) and I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve tried all the meds, I’ve tried all the treatments, and it just doesn’t get any better. I’ve tried to die 3 times, got as far as planning my 4th, but got caught and sent away. 
 
That was almost a decade ago now, and I just can’t do it anymore. My family is a bunch of sociopathic narcissists, and only care about themselves. My mother is a good mother, but not a good person, but I do care about her, she is the reason I’m still here. But I’m tired, I’m tired of doctors, I’m tired of hope from meds that never work, I’m tired of searching for new treatments that do nothing. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. I will suffer for the rest of my life, as I have suffered this far. I’m going to die anyways, why do others get to decide when and how? If I can’t live my life for myself, why should I be forced to live it for others? I solely just want to be at peace, no debt, no joy, no sadness, no fights, no anything. I just want to stop, everything. Nothing works anymore, no form of pleasure seems to be enough anymore, my brain is fried, my body is failing, I am just a shuffling husk of a person and all I need anymore is sweet release.",1
"Got severe depression, am I asking too much from a friend?","My friend said that I am the best friend she ever had. Yes I am, I can sense how she feels and appear to help even when she hasn't asked. She admitted that she is not good in expressing feelings, but she will always be grateful to have me by side. Literally, I can walk through fire for my friend, I was always there and I love giving because it makes me feel valuable.

Started from June, I got serious mental breakdown and got diagnosed with depression in August. I started to signal her that I need help, that I need her company to help me get back with my life, she said that she would always be by my side, but she appeared to be extremely busy cannot do anything else. 

Everything became worse since then, since she was the only one I can trust, I always expect for her to reach out for me. Although she tried, buying some food, spending couple of nights texting me, but everytime we met, I feel like things between us began to fall apart. She didn't even recognize when I cried hysterically right next to her, and didn't even say a thing to me. I fell deeper and deeper into the hole of depression and everytime I get alone, I started to have suicidal thoughts and buid up hatred towards her as I thought she didn't care. When I got out of control, we even argued and both ended up with broken hearts. 

I felt like I have lost myself. I decided to get diagnosed again and this time the results came out with severe depression. I realized that most of the causes leading to my depression revolve around her. 

I don't want to risk losing another friend, but I wish that she could do something more. If I was in the situation, I would immediately rush to her house to comfort her, take her out to dinner, keep talking and sharing so she wouldn't feel lonely...I don't know, I just need pure care from people that I loved.

Am I being selfish for asking so much?",1

Every girl I tried talking to just wants to be friends or isn’t looking for an relationship. The only reason I am still alive is the fact that I don’t want to be a dead son to my parents but also them see me as worthless piece of shit and they told or showed me that more then once. I suffer every night crying myself so sleep and nobody notice it. I just want to be happy once. Even if 2 days go well the next day is pure mental torture. 
I just hope it ends soon.",1
I’m Desperate. Help.,"
I’m so tired 

I’m desperate.

I don’t know where to start. 
I’ve been chronically depressed for about 2-4 year about three times in my life. Im currently in my early thirties, unemployed, and living with my ex-fiancé. 
Im currently in the state I’ve lived in for my most of my life temporarily as I sort out loose ends for my ex. We had a talk recently and he wants me to move out as soon as possible when I return to the new state we move to. 
He offered to pay for a coding boot camp that would allow for me to save up and move out after the boot camp (4.5) months and possibly get a job as soon as I can so I can hopefully work for two months to save up while in his house. I’d be taking custody of the 3 cats while he takes the dogs. One of the dogs is mine but she needs his dog for company and he has a house with a yard. 
He said he is willing to pay for it depending on how committed I am. I’ve attempted coding classes on my own before but it never went anywhere.
This time around I found the right logic thinking books and I’ve been the most invested this time around.
However, I’m so afraid of the depression returning, not being able to find a job quickly after the boot camp ends, even still convincing him enough that I won’t fail this time around.
Let alone dreading the thought of returning to his house with so much heaviness, resentment, and expectations that hang in the air. 
It’s so difficult living with an ex who admits to domestically raping you for a year, says he didn’t realize I was depressed the last four years and was basically thinking I was lazy and capable enough to work the whole time.
This is a man who wanted to marry me from the get go, I’m his first, and I gave him many excuses for his bad behavior. I was toxic as well but I’ve worked through my issues with time separate from the depression.
Im just so scared of being homeless and without my cats.

Im only here out of state, in my home state, because of the kindness of two friends I lost contact with as a result of isolating because of depression. 
They have both let me stay nearly for a month each. One friend said I can return to live with them but she is married and I doubt her husband would be okay with it. The second friend has a mentally disabled son and I don’t know if she would be okay with cats in her house. Nor did she offer me living with them. 

Lastly, I have my Narcissistic father and enabler mother. They want me to desperately return. I left their home for my exes because I wanted calm. I got it for the most part in my relationship. However, I’m so desperate that I’m thinking of visiting them at least while I’m still in my home state. I don’t think they’ve changed, my father still spreads lies about me, once told my brother in front of my cousin jokingly that he doest have a sister. My mother is just as unhealthy as him. 

I’m just so scared. Mental illness is no joke and neither is unemployment.",1
im 15 and want to kill myself,"im 15 and want to kill myself, i have nothing going for me. i was sexually harrased by my ex, and my gf cheated on me with another guy. the past couple weeks my life has been falling to shit, i havent been showering enough, ive been eating like shit, and sleeping all the time, what would be the best way for going about this",1
Why does rock bottom sound comforting,"I’m a 26 year old dude who’s still got a lot of growing up to do. I have a really good job making 6 figures (not bragging just putting some context to how stupid my decision making is) I have a problem following my own rules. I’ve done therapy and realized I’m my own biggest enemy, and that I need to set more realistic expectations for myself. For example i smoke cigarettes when I’m at work. A realistic goal would be to slowly get myself off. Instead i go “this week I’m not smoking one cigarette, only salads for dinner, no drinking” then it lasts a few days, i crack, and completely fold. I know it’s an unhealthy cycle to put myself through but i can never set these tiny little goals my brain just doesn’t work like that. It’s all or nothing. I try but lately I feel helpless. The slightest hiccup in my plan and i just say fuck it and go right back to square one. I have a terrible drug and alcohol problem, I’m isolating myself from my loved ones more and more by the day. That’s been the scariest part for me, I’m very very social. I love human interaction, and i especially love my friends and family. If you would’ve told me 4 years ago I’d be ignoring their phone calls and finding reasons to stay in bed I’d call you crazy. I know I’m not a piece of shit but I feel like one. I have a flight to catch tomorrow at noon to head back to work, and here I am anything but sober, beating myself up. It’s almost pathetic knowing what I need to do, having every opportunity and resource possible, and still doing the wrong thing. The worst part is when I get this way I don’t go “alright you’re fucked up it’s time to slow down”  it’s like I want to spiral out of control. I’ll drink until I black out or do drugs until I’m completely out of my mind, and I just go go go until I eventually fizzle out. Then I wake up hungover, not mad at the world not mad at anyone just mad at myself again. It’s become such a recurring theme in my life that I’m sick of hearing my own excuses. Like I can’t even trust the own voice in my head. I really do want to do better, idk why I have absolutely no will power. My parents are pretty conservative and raised me with some independent and self sufficient traits. I’m not blaming anyone or anything, I don’t have a tragic backstory, I just keep fucking up. It feels like I want to hit rock bottom, cause then I can sigh some relief and think to myself, “fuck sake it finally can’t get any worse.” Like it would be a weight off my chest. I’m talking quit my job, the whole nine. It sounds so enticing. How psycho is that? I want to fail so I can stop stressing about it. I know this is a blob of ranty nonsense, but if you made it this far. I appreciate it! It feels good even the littlest bit just to type it out. Hopefully if someone’s going through something similar, you can find some p eace knowing you’re not alone. All love y’all ❤️",1
I can't do this anymore,"I don't want to do this anymore, I hate that I have Autism, I hate that I have to deal with having it, and I know that it sounds like I'm just labeling myself, but I Hage when people point it out about me being Autistic, I'm just done, I hate myself, I never will love who I am, I really don't need a life 💔",1
I'm never going to be good enough,I'll never be good enough for anyone. It's all so pointless. Just let me be numb.,1
Something that is in my mind right now...,"I always been sad, like for my majority of my life I am sad, Ofcourse an occational happy period was there mainly furing ""some"" part of my childhood , otherwise my childhood was also sad filled with people crying around me ( my father was a alcoholic so you know how  that goes ) .

anyway i think now i have conditioned myself towards sadness .

like i dont like to be happy now in my life like i like being sad and depressed .

anyone feel like this ?",1
"I want to live, and yet I want to die. At this point I don't know what to do anymore.","I have a lot of people that care about me (my parents, my girlfriend, my friends) and yet I still feel empty inside. I want to live, knowing that I have people in my life that care about me and yet I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Now I'm confused and nobody in my personal life seems to know what's going on, so I've never really been asked if I'm okay. Everybody I know comes to me and vents about their problems and their struggles but what about me...
And so I've came to here to try to find some clarity on what I'm going through",1
Can’t concentrate at all,I find myself unable to concentrate at all after having depression. I can barely read anything without drifting off to thinking about something else. I also feel now energy most of the time. Does anyone else feel the same way? Feel free to share more about your experience.,1
Im sort of done,I already killed myself before and was like nope maybe i want to live and had to go thru surgery. Honestly im just done. My best friend is dead. I honestly dont have anything to live for and i honestly just keep pushing through like theres some stupid light at the end of the tunnel even though there isnt. If i ever get really rich ill prob donate all my money and kill myself. At least then i can leave this earth knowing i tried helping or something. I hate my life. Im in california and trying to stay positive is just impossible nowadays. I want to die. I just want real friends not stupid friends falling out over dumb shit. I think im done but idk why im not pushing myself to do it. I give up and im confused. Maybe i just need someone to talk to. I cant.,1
Nothing,"I feel that I have nothing. It's more than just emptiness at this point. I have nothing, I am nothing. I have no place or person of my own. I'm practically a ghost.

No one talks to me, no one wants anything of me. I don't even feel connected to the sky or the sea. The birds or the trees. Who am I if I'm nothing? Was I ever anyone? I don't think so anymore. I can't see the future. I don't think of the past. I am a husk. A mask. A ghost. Living dead. Nothing.",1

Feeling absolutely wonderful on pregabalin.,"I feel incredibly good for the whole day when I take even a low dose (150mg) of pregabalin like I am saying to the world - ""bring it on, I am ready"". 
But otherwise I feel low, asocial, kinda unmotivated. 
Does this mean I am depressed and I should start taking antidepressants?",1
Is there a fix? Life cant be just about all this pain.,"To add to my ugly face, my hair loss has led me to look like an old chap. I am 30 but people keep talking to me as I am 40+ calling me Sir and what not. It just keeps getting worse every day. I am unable to look at my pictures or even the mirror at times. It feels so unfair when closest of my friends face no such issues and have an amazing social life. Want this pain to get over so badly. Its as if I got every bad gene that my parents had while my sibling got every good one. No one would believe we are related unless told :D  
  
Is there an escape? bc surely there is no fix to this.

My heart skips a beat,Yey after changing my meds (6th fucking time) my heartbeat is well... interesting. So yea i'm staying in a hospital for observation right now.,1
Empty,"It’s becoming way to normal to not feel anything again. Same patterns as before. I can basically watch myself becoming “hollow” again. I hope this is somewhat coherent. 
I just really don’t know what to do. I mean I know what I love but even that feels like it’s fading. I just want someone i can make happy. I don’t even need anything. I just want to make someone truly happy",1
I don't know why I cry,"So yeah don't really know how to word it by saying all the reasons I ""had"" to cry. So last year around this time I lost two people my uncle and my dad, my uncle was suicide and my dad. I watched him die because he was stubborn, I feel traumatized I still freeze up when I see certain things or hear certain things or smell certain things. I honestly thought about ending it then. I couldn't see how my life could get worse, my girlfriend dumped me. I uncle shot himself. My dad had just died. But it got worse. My mom was told she has 1-2 years left and I don't think she'll make it to may. And that sucks but stuff usually doesn't make me cry I've always been told ""Maddie your a big girl stop crying"" so I did. If something life crushing was told or something id seen id maybe she'd one or two tears that's it. And the last time I cried before recent was Nov 17 2022 as of these last four months I can't stop crying. But nothing provokes it I'll just be doing something and then I'm crying. And I know I feel empty, but like why am I crying. It's especially bad when I shower I find myself sitting in there for at least an hour just curled up crying. I don't really understand why.",1
Life is not fulfilling sober.,"Everything is just so mundane, regular hobbies become infuriating and nothing feels worth anything. Can’t find a job to support my habits and each day is just another day looking for an escape. It’s always never enough.

"""youre not alone"" doesnt make me feel better","I know its kinda of a pethetic thought but whenever i hear this i take it more as ""others have it worse"" since I have mental health support that doesnt even work i just really feel like Im just taking this place away from someone else",1

I'm just done, i have so many traumas, so many stories i just wanna be done, i was harm free for several months before recently, and i don't wanna stop i wanna keep self harming until it all fades away, everyone always leaves, i'm tired of this horrible feeling of lonelyness, this self hatred, i need it all to go away, i just can't keep going.",1
"Hearing ""it gets better"" when you have family members whose lives have never gotten better.","It's an empty promise. I literally have family members in their 60s whose lives are sad and / or wasted. One of them died after never finding true peace and happiness and being verbaly abused every day.

So what I'm trying to say is, for some people it just never gets better. Some people's entire lives pass by stuck in one place, stuck in poverty, with noone to love them. 

And telling people it'll get better for them might just not be true, and they start wondering what's wrong with them.",1
"17, No support network and i want to kill myself","Im 17. I have good grades, born into a well off family and im generally friendly with everyone around me, as in lots of casual friends. I should live the most perfect life. I shouldnt feel like this. I used to have close friends, those that supported me through everything and tried to help. But i drove them all away, one by one. The first one left because she felt like she was being used. The second left because he felt worn out from having to help me all the time, and from me talking too much to his girlfriend. The third thought i was a burden to everyone. The fourth said i was selfish. I agree with all of them. Through out 1 year of being friends with them, i was horribly depressed. I had episodes lasting months, and only being moderately okay for a week or two before the next episode started. I tried hanging myself twice, but stopped by my friend physically coming knocking at my house in the middle of the night. When i wasnt actively planning to off myself i would cut myself up to 27 times a week. Lots of times id skip periods to cry in the bathroom for hours. I always cry myself to sleep. Ive been wishing to die in my sleep for 4 years, bc i had no friends for 15 years and the only consistent companion i had was art.

Now i have casual friends but no close friends and im still so lonely. I dont feel connected with any of my casual friends, and were only friends bc we happen to be in the same class. But at the same time i dont want to make any more friends lest i burden them with my depression. No one deserves to deal with my problems, and literally everyone is happier without me around. My friends said that themselves before leaving. I feel like i offer no value anywhere, in fact, i actively harm and wear away the ppl that i get too close with. Im too seflish bc all my energy is spent on keeping myself alive and couldnt be spared for anyone else. My vision doesnt go beyond myself and my problems bc im too caught up in my own misery that i ended up neglecting my friends' feelings of being worn out until it was too late. Now they dont want to be associated with me in any way whatsoever.

I am utterly of no value, and no one would care when im gone bc ive driven them all way. Im a horrible human being that should have been aborted when my mom and the rest of my family was considering that option 17 years ago. Im a waste of oxygen and should rid myself to do this world and everyone else that i might cross paths with in the future a favour. Im considering jumping off the balcony or successfully hanging myself. I give up.",1
f13.need help,"f13. i am too depressed to even speak. i cant remember the last time anyone regarded me as someone they know. ive struggled for too long and too much, i have given up so many times. yet life wont leave me",1
M16 and already its game over,"I feel like I have no coping mechanisms anymore. One exciting thing comes along, then I go right back to square one. As an ugly guy, who has never been shown interest from women, it is hard to accept that it is over because it just destroys the image ive been thinking of since I was 6 years old. I have gained weight, lost weight, done my hair differently, tried skincare routines to the point of gaining immense knowledge on the topic, and to no avail.   


My friends, I feel like they also hardly give a fuck about me. I just want to be alone from them, but I feel like it will make me feel worse. Theres also school work which is depressing me. Ive felt like this for too long, the bitterness, the frustration, its gotten to my heart. My mom says she'll let me pay to go to a psychiatrist, but she will refuse to let me take meds. I fucking need the meds, because I seriously can't go on any longer feeling like this, but she will not budge. Hygiene has become the ultimate chore, I have stopped going to the gym at this point, all I can do is eat shit food. I have felt the same when I was eating clean and going to the gym alot more often. It feels like there is no solution near me. I can no longer be excited for the school weekend.  


Its so tough knowing that other people get shit handed to them. That the world is ultimately unfair like this. Life is probably going to get worse after high school, not better. Almost everyone knows this. Especially since I want to pursue medicine, college is only going to be a bitch, I will be alone in a different continent. But I am glad it will take up most of my day, then ill be a lot less alone with my thoughts. I don't even know what you can tell me. What advice can probably work. Some bullcrap like ""its gonna get better"" or ""just keep through it"". I have lost all motivation, I become draining to myself and others and I feel like the world is better off without me. But I am still too scared to commit.   


Anybody who feels just like me or is in the same boat give me coping advice?",1
boyfriend is depressed because of his assignments and idk how to support him,"my boyfriend (25M) and myself (21M) have been dating for nearly the past year. he is an international student and suffers from ongoing depression which is managed by medication and is in his last year of university although our relationship mostly goes well, an ongoing issue has been his schoolwork which he tends to struggle a lot with. 

earlier this year, he was unable to complete his first semester assignments and as such, has had to extend his course and student visa. he's told me several times that this has caused him a lot of stress, self-doubt and depression due to how he's been seeing his peers move ahead in their lives while he is still stuck in school, he's also worried he won't get a job. 

i am now done with my assessments as my course is more exam heavy but i want to spend more time with him because i am moving away for uni next year so we will be long distance for a while.

it is now the end of the year and the issue has come back, he has 5 assignments which were all overdue and all were granted extensions due to his mental condition. 2 of these assignments have now been completed with some assistance from me but he still has 3 left and i'm really worried about him. 

recently he has been sleeping more (at least 10 hours and sometimes more than 12) and in most of this time he just procrastinates by gaming. i know that it is his education and i should prioritise looking after myself rather than sticking myself into his business but i don't want to see him worsen his own fears and have to extend his course again. also, of course i want to spend time with him over the break.

i know this is a really complicated situation but i wanted to ask on here, how should i best support him? should i keep pushing him or just bite my tongue with the potential in the future for him to extend his course and regret that i could have done something about it?

TLDR; boyfriend has depression and is struggling to complete assignments, what's the best way for me to support him?",1
I’m struggling…,"I’m a 33 year old married woman who has been suffering from depression and social anxiety ever since I was a child. I work hard despite my past issues with working but I’ve been moderately successful because I’ve had a great support system, one of whom was my mother, but she passed away almost 3 years ago and my great grandmother who was also much older but a major part of my life died three months before she did. 

At 30 y/o at the time I’ve never had any major losses in my life. And the past few years, my marriage is failing because I’m not doing my part enough as a wife and my depression has intensified. I have no desire to have outside fun, I prefer to be alone because it’s easier and I have no real friends I regularly speak to. I am speaking to a therapist but it only helps so much. 

My husband doesn’t understand how difficult it is but at the same time I’ve been making rash decisions that is upsetting him and he’s explained to me everything he expects of me isn’t being met. Maybe I’m not trying hard enough idk I feel like I’m dragging him down with my dark cloud but I wasn’t always this bad, I feel like it’s been more so the past couple of years since I lost my mom, not to mention the months leading up to her death when she was sick going through chemo. She has always been my strength, and I’m struggling adjusting to life without her as a grown woman( I know it sounds sad but she’s always fought my battles for me).

I just feel like I’m stuck trying to make it through the day and work and no real motivation to really plan for the future. My energy and motivation is inconsistent and it’s frustrating. My husband is Also wanting kids which I’m trying to provide but I can’t help but wonder how I’m going to get through this and try to raise a family. We are constantly arguing about me messing up and him telling me he didn’t realize my issues were this bad when we’ve been married for 2 years and together for 8. I’m always having a meltdown and I’m reaching my breaking point with everything I just don’t know what to do. Am I not doing enough to prioritize my mental health to save my marriage?",1
I am so close to pouring out all my emotion,"it is not good. I don't choose to bottle everything, I just can't find an alternative. 

Lately I am getting close to just screaming at my family and telling them everything then just slam the door and leave. I can't do that tho, I have nowhere to go and I am at a very sensitive point in life. I can't let anything stupid happen.

I don't understand how my family can't see that I am not okay. It is very obvious. I don't think they care. They have been asking me to work to support them lately but I am a minor and I am studying at the moment. plus why would I do anything for them when they limit my freedom and ruin my mental health. 

All I am telling myself lately is bottle it up some more, you've bottled up too much already, you can't let it all go to waste. but if don't manage to go to the university I want to go to after all this bottling up, I don't know what to do with my life. I would lose the very last thing that I kept going for.",1
What is depressive realism?,"Depressive realism is a psychological hypothesis that asserts that depressed individuals may be more accurate in their assessments of certain situations. This belief is in contrast to what is known as “optimistic bias,” in which some people may see the world in a more positive light when things are going wrong. 

The depressive realism hypothesis was first proposed by L. B. Alloy and L. Y. Abramson in the late 1970s. Their initial experiment aimed to test this hypothesis and determine whether depressed college students attending university might have a more realistic outlook than others, aka depressive realism.

Numerous studies in experimental psychology have been conducted since Alloy and Abramson first developed the idea of depressive realism. This area of investigation may go against modern psychology, as many psychologists believe that people with depression are prone to cognitive distortions (a type of self-deception) that make their thinking less realistic. Understanding the degree to which people with depression think realistically may give therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists vital information to help better treat their patients.",1
i need help soon,"i literally cannot do this, i thought i could hold off on help until my 18th as it’s been a few months but i cannot do this anymore i cannot live like this.

i need mental health help and like now, i cannot wait months i am spiralling so bad

it’s just slowly gotten worse and worse over the last few weeks, i can’t sleep, i can barely eat, i just want to stay home and do nothing it’s so fucking intense right now.

i’ve never been on meds before because i got convinced by like everyone in my life to never go on them but everything is so bad right now my anxiety is crazy, i feel like running away from life right now.

Went on a walk,"I finally had enough motivation to go on a walk and try to clear my head. The only things I could think about the entire time was hoping I'd get hit by a car, someone would pull up in a car and shoot me or just me going to sit down and end it with my knife.",1
My brain always gets stuck on some negative loop. Every few months its a new thing. But its always depressing and takes over my life.,"I hate living like this. About a year ago I didn't have a job and my main focus was panic attacks. Multiple daily panic attacks, I was convinced I had a heart problem because that mofo was racing non stop and I couldn't breathe.  
  
I got a job, took my mind off my heart and boom healed.  
  
Then all I could focus on was how bad I was at the job. I was new, it makes sense, I was learning. But all day and all night all I could think of was what others thought of my job performance and all the things I must be messing up.   
  
Eventually that insecurity changed into my social anxiety. Why was I so awkward and quiet. What did others think of me? Were they making fun of me. Do I have something like autism that makes me struggle socially?  
  
Then I developed a crush on a girl that started getting close to me.   
  
Was she just being friendly, was it pity, did she actually like me? Every social interaction was blown completely out of proportion and the overthinking was insane.   
  
As we got closer and started hanging out more I became focusing on the friendship part of it. Did they really like me this much, how would they like me, what if they're faking it, what if they felt bad for me, did they all talk shit behind my back?  
  
The girl ended up quitting and now im completely heart broken. I know it just wasn't meant to be since it happened this way and that should be the end of it. But I cant come to terms with it. My brain is just always spinning with thoughts of her and how cool she was and what could have been.   
  
Its always been this way, and I fear it always will be.   
  
Every couple of months its some new thing that makes me hate life and takes complete control of my mental resources.   
  
It could be anything. But its always negative and all consuming.   
  
Every time.  
  
Over the months and years of my life.  
  
I promise myself to stop with the soothing compulsions but I never stop.. I have told myself over YEARS and it hasn't stopped. I just cant stop.",1
Porn addiction sucks,"Really makes me feel like such a loser, I don't have a partner not that I particularly want the romance part but it definitely doesn't make me feel any better about myself.

Problem,"Maybe i'm just always the problem, that's why I'm alone and unloved. Maybe this is the way things should be. I feel like I don't deserve anything. I'm tired. I just want to disappear.",1
Wish I could just vanish,"Oftentimes, I feel like cutting off everybody in my life, and just living by myself in some place far away from everything. I feel like I cause too much trouble for other people and that those who know me would just be better off if I vanished off the face of the Earth, then they wouldn't have to deal with me anymore.

 I'm probably going to stop attending college after my first semester, and I don't really have any dreams or aspirations of what I want to do with my life, so I'm probably going to end up working some shitty job somewhere just to survive. This is making me feel like I'm going to be seen as a disappointment by my family. I also can't help but feel like I'm genuinely just not a good friend and a terrible person, I don't know where this comes from but it's there. Overall, I feel like I've wasted my friend's and family's time, money, and energy.

I am an extremely boring, miserable, quiet person with pretty much nothing in the way of hobbies. I feel so pathetic and worthless, and I think about jumping off of this one bridge near me way more often than I should.

This stuff makes me strongly feel as though I should just move to some city where nobody knows me and where I don't have to talk to anybody. Does this make sense?",1
Is it wrong to blame my family for the mental state I have fallen into lately?,"I (21F) have been feeling resentful and angry towards my father and other family members a lot more recently than usual. I usually get into a cycle of being okay around them to isolating myself from them to avoid starting any fights every couple of months, but lately I just can't help but lash out at them. 

For context, I was an accident; I am the second and youngest child of my parents. They were never married. They actually hate each others guts and as a result, my mother raised my sisters (I have a half sister, different father) and myself on her own. I would visit my dad every once in a while.  

As a kid, I idolized my father but all for the wrong reasons; He would let me get away with a lot of things, let me go out to hang out with friends often, etc. In reality, he mooched off of his gfs, cheated on his gfs (some of which I was present for in the other room or front seat or left outside in the car by myself), neglected to take me to get eye surgery for my cross eyes (had to do it myself when I was 17), he never paid attention to me and just put a screen in my face, etc. 

My mother wasn't much better. She moved my sisters and I from state to state growing up. She never paid attention to me and whenever I tried to express how I was feeling I was brushed off. Telling her about how I was being bullied in school or trying to tell her I didn't feel comfortable with doing something was like talking to a brick wall. 

When I was 12 she got a gf and moved my sister and I out of state (my half sister stayed to raise her newborn son). Her gf was extremely manipulative and verbally abusive. My sister and I reached out to our mother countless times to tell her how we were being mistreated, but she never listened. Even when I went to a psych ward because I said I wanted to k\*ll myself, she nor anyone else listened. It was constant walking on egg shells. My sister (18yo then) and I (16yo at that point) managed to ecape by getting my dad to drive down and get us. 

We lived with our aunt for a little while, who introduced my sister and I to drinking. She was a raging alcoholic and her husband was just as bad. I once drank eight shots of Vodka when I was home alone while they were out at an arcade. It was around my 17th birthday and I was feeling incredibly depressed. 

I now live with my father, his gf, and his gf child. I can't afford to move out yet, but I am working hard towards doing so. 

But like I said in the beginning, I have been very angry and distant with my father and other family members recently. I can usually pretend everything is okay, but then I shut down. My depression has been at an all time high, going as far as to effect my work life and relationship with my bf. My bf grew up in a loving family and does not understand how I feel, but I catch myself ranting about my feelings. He doesn't say so, but I'm sure he is tired of hearing about it. I've gotten into drinking a lot recently to feel numb for a little bit, drinking moderately throughout the week. I've considered therapy, but go back and forth with wondering if it's actually worth it. 

I come into constant contact with both my father and aunt; my mother is a truck driver and lives in a different state. Lately whenever I see them I want to scream and blame them for why I am so messed up in the head now. Whenever I do get angry at them, they label me as having anger issues and brush me off. They make me feel as though I am still that helpless kid who is being cast aside and neglected again. They make degrading comments on how I am handling some things and when I snap back, they play victim. 

I feel like I'm on the brink of a breakdown. I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. I don't have motivation to do anything, I feel like a worthless waste of space, and I just want to dissapear. 

Am I wrong for blaming them for my mental issues? 

I know as an adult it is up to me to seek professional help and I plan to do so soon. I just want to know if there are other people that have had similar experiences and maybe then I'll feel like I'm not crazy. ",1

But then when I think about the career I went to school for I get so anxious bc it’s such a big job and i honestly don’t know if I’m in the right mind set for it which is shitty to admit - bc I wanna be good at it. when I think of family life and friends I get so upset. When I think of moving to Vegas or alaska or somewhere that’s not where I am I get happy. See the problem? Now is stressful, the future is unpredictable. Somewhere else is the solution.

I (33m) went to the psychiatrist and now I feel even more depressed,"
First of all, even with good insurance it took me two months to even find a psychiatrist.  He told me “there’s no magic bullet. The best you can hope for is maybe slowly make some improvements over the course of several years.” 

So great, maybe if I’m lucky I can finally start living my life by 40. 

He prescribed me Zoloft which I’ve taken in the past, and now I remember why I stopped it before: I can barely even feel my penis after only a few days taking it.  And I’m really sick of psychiatrists never even mentioning side effects before prescribing.",1
A recent surge of panic attacks and depression.,"I got my first job a month ago. And during this month I've had 3 major panic attacks. I'm 22, and I've never felt panic attacks like this before. I start shaking, hot and cold flashes, bad gut, tight chest, suffocation, restlessness, feels like I am dying/doomed. It's awful, and I know that I'm not the only one who experiences this. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  
Right now I'm going through my 3rd panic. It just randomly happened about a week ago and now everyday I wake up with adrenaline and I am panicked. I'm not sure what started all this, but the best guess is the sudden change of having a job for the first time. It's a job I like though. The other theory is that my first panic attack has triggered me to be forever afraid of having more panic attacks because it was so bad. It's very difficult to pin down why this started. I try to think about it, but don't come out with anything.  
I am going to be seeing a new therapist next week via online. Getting one in person seems to be too difficult right now. Hopefully that will help? I have tried taking many different anxiety medications but nothing seems to work for me. I don't feel any different on most medication. Besides clonidine, which makes me feel really tired. And so clonidine has helped me get through these hard days.  
I'm also going to be trying CBD. I don't know if it'll do anything, but I am trying everything to get this to stop. I can barely eat anything because of my symptoms. My stomach constantly feels like its in knots.  
One of the only things that calms me down is playing with my friends. One of my triggering thoughts for these panic attacks is ""I'm bored of everything, nothing will interest me, what's the point?"". I love playing games, and I try to remind myself that. But when I play alone during these week-long panic attacks playing by myself doesn't distract me from these thoughts.",1
I just want to sleep forever.,"I'm so tired. Today's my 15th birthday. My dad can't be here, my great grandma is dead, and I'm just realizing how long my life has been fucked up. 

For 8 years now my life has been complete shit. Probably longer. I can't remember anything from before the age 7. 

I got diagnosed with depression, OCD, anxiety, ADHD, and autism before school started, and being diagnosed with all these things haven't helped my mental health at all, because I'm just not enough of anything for anybody to think I need actual help. 

Not to mention, the ""actual"" help I'm getting is therapy, where we talk about seesaws and teeter-totters. Balancing responsibility and fun. HOW CAN I BALANCE MY SEESAW IF IT'S SNAPPED IN HALF? I have no responsibilities and I can't have fun because my disorders prevent me from feeling anything besides anger, sadness, and fear. 

I try my best. I do my very best. But my best is never good enough. Nothing I do is satisfactory. Even when I produce high scores or academic awards out of my ass like a golden goose, nobody bats an eye. Just so long as my grades are above a D, my parents just ignore me. 

The last time someone that mattered congratulated me, I can't even remember. I've pretty well raised myself anyways. So my parents won't even congratulate themselves for my successes. But the moment I slip up- you bet someone is in my ear making fun of me or taunting my failures. 

I'm too tired to continue ranting. 

Tl;dr: I'm dying on the inside, but still doing my best to be the best, all the while being ignored by the people I love.",1
"I find my life meaningless, i wish i never existed","I used to love life but until 2019 when everything decides to crumble.

I moved out out a year ago and still they can financially control me by guilt tripping me. I loaned out 100k for them as they promised to pay it all, and would guilt trip me when I say no. They brought me up as a people pleaser and they know that. They then guilt tripped me into giving them all my savings to pay off the loan. I feel stupid that at this age I cant get away from them. I live pay check after pay check. I feel like life now if not worth living for anymore. Who would even want a depressed nurse to care for them anyways.",1

My wife, the person that means most to me I feel like I’ve let down, maybe not to her but to me I have. I know there’s things that I should’ve been doing emotionally for her, but I was so held back myself I couldn’t.. she stuck around for me, I’ll always love her for that. But some things are coming up and now I’m reacting negatively again, why do I do this? Why can’t I stop dragging myself through this miserable loop even if I know it’s wrong? I feel like I’m letting everyone down and I don’t know why… please someone tell me I’m wrong. Tell me that I am seeing this incorrectly.. tell me that everything I think is gonna happen won’t happen, and that it’s all in my head.  I’ve so anxious that even my own mom is wondering why I keep questioning her loyalty to me, why I think that she doesn’t want to talk to me and truth is… idk either… why do I feel this way. I want to know suicide isn’t my only option and that I’m wrong for thinking it is.. maybe I need to hear it from someone else cause I don’t credit my own words…",1
Experiences with lamotrigine?,"I currently take pregabalin and mirtazapine for sleep. The meds work magnificently for sleep, however they do nothing for my extreme depression, and in fact may be contributing to it.

I have been recommended lamotrigine by my doctor. I have heard it has helped many people.

What is wrong with me,"My sadness is so weird. I only get it at certain times of day(usually at night) but It happens pretty much everyday. 

I actually live a fairly motivated life outside of this sadness. I’m almost alwase happy around my friends. Unless my friends are sad.

But when the sadness hits it puts a damper on me. It alwase manifests in deep self loathing. It makes me feel like I should be depressed all of the time. 

One time it was so bad that I was going to put hateful messages all around my life to make myself sad all the time. But thankfully, I snapped out of it right afterward.

Because it happens at night, I usually don’t get around to showering because I shower at night.

TLDR, I feel like I’m not depressed but not not depressed.

I have some theory’s about why this is though:
(1), I stay in my room most of the day.
(2), More or less than halve of my friends have depression or anxiety.
(3), Normal teenage stuff.
(4), I may or may not have ADHD.
(5), 4 of my friends are suicidal
(6), I spend like 3+ hours on a call with my friends and I’m emotionally exhausted by the end of the day
(7), I spend at least an hour per day searching up symptoms of mental illnesses and disorders
(8), I read Reddit poasts about mental illness",1

How to move forward and take care of myself?,"There is nothing good or even normal about me in other words if I don't deserve to be alive.

Health, looks, mental health, everything is just a mess and it's not ok for me to have a normal life I shouldn't exist.

So needless to say I shouldn't get married (the only relationship we can have here) or anything like that and I am very useless in everything, I can't keep a job, I am very weak mentally and physically, and I really hate myself.

Considering all of that, I refuse to see any doctors and I live in pain. I stopped taking my blood pressure pills, but some things are happening and I can't make sure that it will kill me or give me a stroke that will paralyze me, so I am giving up and I will take them again, but that's it I don't want to fix anything else. I have other problems like acid reflux(probably) and it keeps me in bed for a couple of days when things get really bad I can't even breathe or move, I have neck problems and it's causing my tinnitus to get worse ...ect 

The problems I really care about though aren't fixable so what's the point?

I really hate everything about myself and I am not exaggerating when I say I am a disgusting human being with something wrong in probably every part of my body unfortunately nothing very serious like cancer, for now.

Everyone my age and younger is doing better than me in life, I haven't had a job for almost 2 years (except one month) and I really suck at it, but I can't do anything else at all. 

I tried hobbies and other stuff, and I learned a lot of skills to have a good job, but something ruined them for me

>!religion ruined everything for me (I was raised in a very strict religion that prohibits everything that remotely brings me any happiness or peace)!<

I am too old now for anything good to happen in my life (at least where I live) so I want to start slaving my years to a job I hate and accepting that I will be cursed in life for a very long time with nothing good happening in it. Hopefully, I will die soon, but unfortunately, it's not happening right now I just live in pain.

I just want to work on accepting this fact and maybe go see a doctor or 100 (yeah that's about right) when I have some money and stop dreaming about the future I will never have.

Apparently, to do anything in my life I have to get out of my room, start having a social life, and take my pills, and I can't get myself to do any of that I literally just want to set it on fire.

So, How to do anything about anything in this curse we call life?

I think the saddest thing I've ever heard is someone saying that any potential life in the universe would face the same challenges as current hummanity.,"I remember seeing a conversation about how we're fucking up our planet with fossil fuels and valuing profit over everything else. Some people were saying that potential life forms face the same problems. They would start industrial revolution the same way we did without knowing the consequences. They would do the same we did and focus on progessing while being ignorant to any potential problems. They were saying that it would be natural for a civilization to do this. Now this is so sad to me because they lack so much perspective. The same people that are making good money by making up alternate universes and a multiverse will be the first to shut down how we don't have to be a civilization that works. We shouldn't be a civilization that values profit over peoples lives. But they will just say that we're lazy for thinking this way. That we're out of touch. But the thing is the people who think like this are the ones that truly understand how vast the universe is. They truly understand the possibilities that can exist. They know that life shouldn't be like this. Personally, I get so angry at this. I've suffered so much trauma in my life and the one thing that could have made it slightly better was feeling like an actual adult. But I don't feel that because they won't allow me to make a fucking livable wage. I can barely afford to live. Cost of living shouldn't even be a thing especially since all the scientist making good money are saying that there could be a multiverse. There could be any and all possibilities. I actually believe this so I get so sad and I despair so much that this is what the humans on earth have. Only a few get to enjoy because they exploit the fuck out of everyone else. I'm so angry. I'm so sad. I plan on being dead before 50. Fuck all of this. They won't be exploiting me in my 60s. In my 70s. I'll rather be dead to spite them all. They won't get anything from me any longer when I'm old. I don't even want them to exploit me now but everyone around me wants me to stay alive and suffer.",1

Liquid “Confidence”,"I passed out and missed the date before it even started. I was just so nervous, I didn’t know what to do…",1
I remember,"I remember when things seemed easier. When I was young I thought I knew it all, I never had a plan. All we did as youngsters was try to gangbang and kick it with the homies, get high n get drunk n some other things I cant talk about, thats all that was on my mind, everyday I just wanted to get into new shit. I never really thought about things before doing them. My mom she couldn’t control me, my dad was doing 15 years in prison, he got locked up a couple weeks after I was born so I never really had a father figure, instead I had an abusive stepdad who was always on drugs and beat the shit out of my mom. That scarred me, those memories hurt. Growing up I was always easily influenced, I grew up around nothing but gangs, a lot of my family members in gangs, every so called friend I had in gangs, my father and stepfather were in gangs, everything was surrounded around this gang, It caught my eyes at a young age maybe 9 or 10 years old when I was about to go homeless, we moved into my mom’s friend house, her son same thing in this gang, so everyday him in his homies always there always getting high n drunk together in the house or in the front yard, they were probably in their late teens early 20s n I used to hang with them thats where it started. That was a big part of my life n a lot of stuff happened for a while until I was around 14 or 15 after my homie estevan was murdered, I wanted something better for myself, I stopped coming around, everyone I knew started hating me for that, I got expelled from school then dropped out after that I disappeared, my dad got out of prison when I was 15, he was still stuck in his old ways and mindset, so I distanced myself from him. I started getting high everyday to help me, I would smoke 3 to 4 times a day until I was around 17 I tried to get sober a few times. Fast forward to nowadays im just stuck with all these mental problems and trust issues, I think one day I will eventually kill myself, mentally im not strong anymore and haven’t been for a while. Now I’m feeling like I need someone to tell me it’s okay someone to be there. I’m losing my mind. Feel like I was cursed since birth. I wish I could go back and do things differently ",1
Past haunting me still,"I had some bad shit happen to me over the past 6 years, been used, lied to, wronged, deceived and abandoned by people that were very close and dear to me.  I’ve bottled the thoughts and emotions up and tried to move on, but recently they’ve resurfaced and I can’t control them anymore, they’re fucking me up even more than I already I am, and I can’t talk about it to anyone.  Anyone got advice on how to deal with that? Coz I fucking need it.",1
Finally done,"After a decade of deep depression, trying everything and realizing there is no reason to continue this misery I found a solution. What do I have to look forward to? The best of my life is over, I hate my family, can’t be independent, I have no one, everything that I want is unattainable, I don’t want to work a crappy job or any job really for the rest of my life for some mediocre life, I don’t want to be close to anyone ever again, I don’t want to get married or have kids anymore, health will continue to deteriorate, and the moments of short lived contentment or happiness isn’t worth it to me in exchange for the immense suffering. I have no interest in the potential choices that I could have in the future, after considering them all, I have no interest in this life whatsoever. I refuse to try to medicate myself in order to tolerate this life or keep talking to people asking for help when they know there is no real cure for my problems only finding ways to cope or make the best out of what it is and what has already happened. I will never get over anything, that’s just how I am, and I won’t lower my standards to force this life to work for me.",1

And for these past 5 months I have been feeling the best I have had in a really long time. I was actually happy and enjoying life. But now within these past couple of weeks I have been feeling low again. Thoughts of cutting myself again and suicide have been creeping up.

Depression and eating habits,"I have major depressive disorder and anxiety i’ve noticed that some days I eat entirely too much and others almost nothing at all. Either way, I feel badly about myself. I don’t know what triggers one or the other as my mood is pretty stagnant…

I keep hoping I’ll get hit by a car,"I'm feeling so lonely, isolated, and depressed. I do try to reach out to people, but I feel like nobody hears or understands how bad it is. I tried to talk to my immigrant mother, who is great otherwise, but she can't fathom how someone who's grown up without war and poverty can suffer mentally like I do and instead seems to think I’m just really sensitive.

Because I have so many people relying on me for financial support I don't feel like suicide is a luxury I can afford. Instead, whenever I hear about people dying in car accidents I keep feeling like I should be the one who does, instead of people who might want to live. I know it's fucked up to view someone else’s tragedy in that way, and I hate myself for that too, I think I just really wish I could die in a “passive” way. I'm sorry for ranting.",1
"For the first time ever ive actually had suicidal thoughts and thoughts about self harming, i dont know what to fucking do","Everything seems so miserable and unfixable. I feel alone all the time and I mostly am alone as well. I hate my job and I dont know my place in this world. I dont know how to fix my life. Im getting small panic attacks just by seeing people that I know post pictures of them hanging out yo social media because it reminds me that Im alone 95% of the time. It drives me crazy, the isolation, actually makes me wanna slit my wrists I hate it so much. I went to a new psychiatrist to an emergency session and she pretty much said that my problems are not worth the emergency session and are easily fixable. So problems which I have had since I was like 12 and are left properly untreated for 7 years are not worth her time. Good to fucking know it doesn't feel demotivating and torturing at all.

 The only reason I am still alive is the fact that I dont want to hurt the few people who actually care about me. And my little sister, she would be devastated and im not gonna do that to her and the rest of my family altough I am just tired of trying and not succeeding. Every time I see a fast vehicle passing by I always seriously contemplate whether I should just go for it or not. During panic attacks its even more so because im pretty much high on anxiety and fear so I cant really think sober and my bodily functions are just kinda running on autopilot.
I just want to feel happiness again, I want to feel that I matter and am not just some random nobody",1
Over the rubicon...,"There's a place beyond depression, one of complete indifference. I just want to feel alive again. I'm not sure if I can handle another 40 years of this.

Ranting is The Best I Can Do,"Yeah everything below is about me, not anyone else.

Have you ever just started internally screaming? Not necessarily at yourself, or anyone but just the AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh as you need to get something out. But you can’t let it out. Because idk you feel the need to repress it, or just simply can’t physically embody what you’re truly feeling. Which is regret, resent, hurt, loss, in all some sort of amalgamation of all three. All because you messed up, you didn’t know how to handle the situation, you played the wrong cards, and ended up pushing away someone. Someone who was probably hurting just as much as you were, probably more, at the time. Someone who did nothing but care, but at a certain point they had to remove themselves from your toxicity.

And then you, being the toxic person that you are, blame them, and keep spiraling out of control. Checking out from other friendships, further isolating yourself. Only years later to realize that you were the problem all along and how badly you messed up. But guess what? There is no going back, there is no second chance. You done fucked up, pushed away the only person to care or relate with you. And so all you can do is internalize the screaming at yourself, the ever lasting Ahhh. Not a cry, not a wimper.

Just a depressed mess. Who has to live with it. Is it for the best, I don’t know. Maybe? Should you move on, yeah probably. What draws you back is it was the only time you had a friend, someone who you can truly relate with. So there is nothing else you can replace it with. It’s not like you can’t move forward, you have.

It’s just live and learn I guess. Do better next time. Though you don’t put yourself in situations where there is a next time. You just mentally check out and drift away from anyone. Yet you still crave that feeling as the loneliness sets in, and then you spiral again. So for some validation you decide that you need to post on Reddit, or just to get it out. I don’t know, but here I am. Hi thanks for reading. Sorry I put you through this, I needed a vent/rant and have no one else. Still spiraling caught between the world of craving yet avoiding everyone.",1
I had a rough holiday.,"My sister is one of those people who has to act aggressively happy and put on this fake “holiday” persona for every holiday.  It’s exhausting just thinking about it.  Me, having depression and lacking energy, always feel resentful and left out of activities because I have the audacity to just be myself — namely, an introverted person with depression just trying to get through the holidays with a mental illness in one piece.  Which is really fucking hard.

The night of Thanksgiving, Thursday night, I cried myself to sleep and in the morning, I woke up quite early in that exhausted didn’t-get-enough-sleep state.  I ended up falling asleep again and woke up very late at 10:45.  

I was awoken by the sound of my sister having an extremely loud, energetic, boisterous, “happy” phone call on speaker phone with my parents.  It had been going on for at least 20 minutes by the time I woke up.  Two things bothered me about it: 1) It was another “happy” activity that I was left out of because I was too exhausted from my depression to participate. 2) - and this is the biggest one - why didn’t my sister think to check on my in the late morning or try to wake me up to include me in the conversation with my parents?  Why didn’t she think, “gee, I wonder why Eliza is sleeping in so late?  Maybe I should check on her and see what’s going on - MAYBE SHE’S SUPER DEPRESSED AND NEEDS MY SUPPORT?????”  The fact that she didn’t think to rouse me or try to include me on the conversation really hurt me.  It was like I was discarded, and forgotten about.

I just feel so fucking lonely during the holidays.  It takes so much energy to have to hide depression from your own family because they’re too busy being fake happy to actually check in on how you’re REALLY doing.",1
I wish I was someone…something else. A kpop idol perhaps?,"I’m depressed because I know I’m always going to be stuck in this ugly, fat, black female body. I wish I could go back in time and delete myself but I can’t. 
I am ignored by my “friends” basically everyday. I go days without texting people. Without talking to people. I wallow and sleep and eat in my room all day unless I go to work, which is another worthless aspect of my life (I’m working to pay rent, and for what else? My life is nothing but pure misery. Sleep. Eat. Work. Shit. Sleep. Work. Eat. Shit). What a vicious and shitty cycle. Where’s the fun? Is this what life is? Why bring someone into a life that’s so shitty? It makes no sense to me. I have nothing to look forward to. No interest. No nothing. I used to want to have a relationship but now I don’t think I do because every time I try to talk to someone, I feel “nothing”. I almost feel incapable of loving besides my family at times. I text my friends and they ignore me. This always happens to me and makes me feel shitty like the POS I am.

Let me stop the ranting. I wish I was a kpop idol because they seem like they have so much fun in their daily lives with their groups. They seem close and happy. They have automatic friends in a sense. They are all beautiful. Talented. Get to travel. Rich. All opposites of me. I hope I die soon and can be reborn as one but I doubt that will happen. Hopefully if I wish enough, maybe it will happen. I’m going to pray/manifest/think/hope on this thought everyday. Because I can’t stay in this life anymore. I refuse it. I will reject it and hopefully it will cause me to die.",1
Someone just told me an acquaintance (18m) just got shot and I mostly felt envy,"The intern at work just told me an acquaintance of his got shot, he's dead now. I reacted with empathy and remorse but the true first thoughts and feelings in my mind were I wish that was me.

"37 Year Old Man, Living at Home, Ashamed of Myself.","I feel like a total loser for being a 37 year old man living at home with his mother. Should I feel this way? In order for anyone to make a knowledgeable conclusion about that I have basically written out my career/financial autobiography here.  


I am an American. I failed my freshman year of high school due to severe depression occupying my every waking thought.  


At 18 I moved out of state to try living with my siblings. I couldn't get a job, siblings eventually sent me back to my mother's house in Texas. I spent the summer volunteering as a scout camp counselor. Eventually I determined the only way to get on with my life would be to lose weight so that I qualify for military service and join the Air Force for college reimbursement. After a year, I lost the weight, but after talking to recruiters I discovered they would not let me join any branch of the military as someone receiving onging treatment for depression. I was told I would have to be off of my medication for a year and have a psychiatrist sign off that I was basically ""cured"". I tried weening myself off of antidepressants for months and eventually conceded that I was not capable of functioning without them.   


While trying to ween myself off of my meds I got a night shift job at a local gas station for $4.95 an hour. A few months in I fell into a severe depression, probably due to the lack of sunlight. I quit that job and decided my best course of action would be to take up my mother's offer to pay for an Associate Degree at a local community college as long as I kept a full time student schedule and worked part time. So at 20 I got a different retail job that paid $6.25 an hour, 20 hours a week tops, while I attended community college for graphic design. My interests always fell under science and art. I had talent in art, zero talent in math, so graphic design seemed like the logical choice.  


A couple of years later I graduate in 2008 with my Associates. My mother offers to pay for a semester at SHSU in their art department to finish my Bachelors; I attend a semester and I am not impressed with the faculty or facilities. SHSU is much more focused on law, agriculture and football. I decide to try to get some actual job experience in my field. I spend a year trying to get an entry level position or internship (I already worked a college internship at this time actually) but was never hired. I eventually get a job working at Hobby Lobby making $8.25 an hour because I have car bills to pay (still living with mother). After 7 months there I get my first graphics-related job at a place an hour and a half away for $10.00 an hour. No graphic design skills are used/required, I basically digitally extend the borders on photo prints to wrap around the edges of canvas prints all day. We work 10 hours a day and are pressured to work on the weekends.  


Let me just interject here that at this point, I still don't know anything about savings, investing, etc. I never made enough money to be able to save anything, and none of the jobs I worked offered any benefits because I was always part-time or was told they could not afford it/offered no benefits. I was also given the impression by my professors in college that I should expect to make $18.00 an hour at my first graphic design position. Never being offered anything above $10.00 an hour for years really embittered me. Eventually, I get a production specialist / designer position at a FastSigns location. Over the course of the next 4 years I work at a few different FastSigns locations, having my full-time pay cap out at $15.00 an hour. At the age of 27 I am for the first time in a position to consider saving and investing (only because I'm still living with my mother), but it's really not something I think about because I've never thought about it before, no one discussed/taught me anything about it before, and I'm still considering these production specialist positions to be stepping stones to an eventual in-house, legitimate designer position. During this time I took out a student loan and returned to school to finish my Bachelor's degree.  


At 29, my girlfriend of 7 years and I move to Seattle where I work at yet another FastSigns for $17.00 an hour. For the first time I have to pay REAL rent money. After spending a year there my girlfriend admits to me that she realized she's a lesbian (she spent more and more time hanging out with a transitioning male to female individual and I was eventually not ""allowed"" to hang out with them. As far as I knew up that that point the transitioning individual was my friend as well). Anyway, she determined that we had to break up. I fell into a deep, dark depression. I started spending days in bed, quit my job, and it became necessary for me to move in with family. That family, of course, ended up being my mother.  


After spending a few months just trying to come to terms with what had happened, I knew I had to at least get a job in order to establish a routine and get me out of my depression. By what seemed to be a miracle, I got an actual in-house graphic designer position with a startup. After a year I had enough money to move out into my own place, making $25.00 an hour. The next couple of years were the happiest and most stable of my life since community college. I started and maintained a weight lifting and intermittent fasting schedule for the first time in my life that lasted 8 months. However, I always wanted to move to Colorado, where my brother and his family live. My bosses eventually allowed me to do so and work remote at the start of 2019.  
Fast forward to Covid, and my bosses start laying off half the company, and give me the ultimatum of returning to the home office in Houston, or finding another job in Colorado. 


After hearing about all of the layoffs happening, I feel I have no choice but to move back to Houston. Plus, I struggled for years and years working for absolute pieces of shit to finally get the position and pay I had, I was terrified of jeopardizing that. After moving back my bosses gave me a 10K raise. For the next year in 2020, I was making $65,000 a year, living in alone in a 1 bedroom apartment. I ended up saving $12,000. 


After some catastrophic management changes my position became so stressful that I had three ocular migraines in one day. This means for hours at a time I was blind and when I closed my eyes I would see a pulsating blue light. A permanent eye floater develops in my right eye, it's centered in my vision and is still there to this day. For the five years I worked there I was always working outside my comfort zone. What we sold and did never aligned with my values and the people we kept company with were borderline pimps and drug dealers. THe new management made me feel like an undervalued stranger in the department I did all of the work in and carried for years. After learning that my mother had ankle surgery and would not be able to drive herself to and from her job for six months, I felt it was a good time to take the opportunity to have a break, reassess my career, and help my mother.  


Fast forward about 8 months and my savings are virtually gone, I'm beginning to live on a credit card. I still feel lost and resolute to not return to graphic design. I do not want to have a sedentary career for the rest of my life. After a lot of deliberation I conclude that I want to pursue a career in wind turbine repair, become an electrician, an arborist, or work for the Forest Service. I get an internship with the Forest Service and move into a government bunkhouse in Colorado, sharing a room with an adult stranger. 


This turns out to be a fantastic 6 months. I actually LOVE my job. From past experience when I feel like I love something that usually subsides after a few months. Not so here. I never stop loving it. THe only drawback is the pay; $15.00 hourly. So while I'm there, summer of 2022, recession hits. I'm in a resort town, prices on everything are high, I'm making my credit card payments but I'm still slowly gaining more debt. At the end of the season I continue volunteering for the Forest Service one day a week so that I qualify for housing (studio apartment in this town is $1600) while I work what is supposed to be a temporary winter job before going back to the Forest Service.  


During this time, my 70 year old mother expresses exasperation with fixing up her house herself. She is trying to prepare it to sell so that she can move to Colorado with me and my other two siblings and retire. I express a great deal of frustration trying to deal with the 10 year record snow fall the town is getting and adjusting to it with my 2WD hatchback coupe. It is cold and always overcast, what I hated about Seattle, it begins affecting my depression. Eventually I decide what the heck, I owe my mother, I'll drive back to Houston where it's at least sunny for the winter, help her, and go back to the forest service in the summer. I pay for my expenses with my credit card again for the next month before I find a job working maintenance at a grocery store. At this point I'm still not willing to deal with the stress I know is inherent to working in marketing as a graphic designer. 


Fast forward a few months helping my mother fix up the house and working part-time, I realize I have to focus on paying off my credit card debt because it is affecting any decisions I am trying to make in a very negative way. I bite the bullet and get a position as a graphic designer. $52,000 is their final offer, and I take it knowing what I've been offered elsewhere, how little my applications have been replied to at that point, and what I should generally expect as a washed-up print-based graphic designer with no animation, coding, back-end web or UI/UX design knowledge/experience, and very little social media marketing under my belt.  


So here we are at present day. I'm 37, I've been at that current company for 5 months, I am putting $2,000 a month toward my credit card and I'm still $10,000 in debt. My student loan payments have been un-paused, I gained 15 pounds, I have now two eye floaters in my left eye and a new one in my right. My hair is thinning in the front, I drive an hour to work and an hour back, paying $20 a day for the tollway I have to drive on. I'm 37, in debt, living with my mother, knowing I would make more money if I learned the aforementioned skills in graphic design, but I'm unwilling to do so due to the obvious detrimental affects the sedentary lifestyle of a graphic designer has on my health. I want to return to the Forest Service, but I need to pay off my debt first (which will take about 6 months) all while knowing I'm going to be making peanuts the rest of my life if I work at the FS, but I determine it's worth it overall. I'm obese, I hate it, I hate myself, and I'm too depressed and exhausted after work to KEEP UP with working out. I do at most for 2 weeks at a time, then drop it for a few weeks to a month.  


So this is why I feel like an absolute failure and a total loser. I am ashamed. I spend my off days closed up in my room as much as possible because seeing my mother just reiterates my position and how much of a loser I feel like I am. ",1

I was playing in my room then but something told me to go out for a while and i saw her dressing up and taking car keys. i asked her ""where are you going"" she answered ""i'm going to shop for cigs"" and that was it. i was thinking if a could drive with her to kill some time but i decided that i want to play some more. that was the fucking worst decision of my life period. why. because she died that day. she was hit by a truck driver (when i looked it up on internet front half of the car was non existent.) and the same after the accident happened i saw my dad. crying. the first fucking time in my short 12 year old life. he was crying. i knew something was off. but no one told me. i just evesdroped that my sister died. a remember like it was yesterday. i couldn't sleep that night not because i was in shock. i didn't even realise what death was at the moment. but i couldn't sleep because in my house (which is in europe made from bricks and have like 80 years) i heard crying all night. and after that my days were pretty normal other than when someone of my friends was joking about death or my sister. i usually became so violent in such situation that it's hard to believe. from that moment onwards i just confined my emotion in the vault of my heart. and no one noticed that the same kid that was with them every single day just faked all of his emotions. even my parents. so know i want to talk a little about my parents. they were normal i guess. they didn't spend much time with me and i'm joking that my real parent was tv but they weren't bad. they were for me when i needed them the most just not when situation wasn't critical. but that changed after my sister's death. they became distant. my mother was even more non existant in my life and even sometimes was shouting at me without a good reason. just because ""she could and she was mad"" and the intresting part for me was that my father started drinking. like i had no clue about that for years i found out like a few months ago but he doesn't drink now so that something. but comming back to topic. after her death i had only my friends i could depend on to stay sane. i had no one other than a few of my friends. but then covid came and it started again. like before i could attend classes irl. my attendence on online courses was non existent. it's mainly because i got into a bad company. it wasn't bad in extreme sense but we were just playing video games instead attending lessons. and after a year in covid on the last month i had to write test for like all of the classes . it was a fucking disaster for my self confidence. i forgot to mention. i was exellent student when it came to studying. like best grades for all of the classes without effort and winning even one or to math tests. (that was good experience) when i got a bad grede i just got into tears. it was disaster for my mind like that's not me i was the best. and others were chasing me. but without studying and playing all the time it changed. but going forward. of coarse i didn't write all of the tests but i somehow graduated this class. it was like ""you're a good boy we will give you a chance"". it was the first miracle of my life.i was christian at the time so the good timing with my sister that i even saw her that day was wierd and it got into my head (i forgot to mention that) that i was the last person that she propably met. that i could do something to make her postponed it or somethink as a child i was thinking that her death was my fault because i could easily prevent that tragedy. even now sometimes it comes back like knife stabing into the heart . so after that graduation was the next and the last year in primary school somehow i did it i really don't remember much from that period other than that the first semester if i recall corectly we had still online classes and i fuck it all up again but then when my parents asked me what's happening. i answered them ""i just want to kill myself life is so dark so blank so black and white. it's just not worth it"" after that i got into a terapy and it helped... a little... at a time... but next i don't remember things really well i got accepted into a middle school started attending like one month and then my depression got te better of me. like i couldn't do a single thing. i was lying in bed 4 hours then playing video games with my ""friends"" for another 4 hours and the sleeping for like 16 hours. for like another year it was like that my hair was long to my elbow at least if i recall. then i was kick out of middle school and was looking for another school to accept me. we found one (my corrent school) and we had a trip for a first year's so i was thinking what can go wrong. some new people nothing crazy right. i so naive. by boys i was treated like a ghost they didn't see me at all. for girls i was called a creep. it was disaster. i was just walking around the place and thinking when we started activities like, volleyball, basketball etc. and i was thinking maybe when i join them i could get some friend that can see me. and i joined tem we played for like 5 minutes and then i sprained my ankle. (it was such an uneven ground that it's not a suprise that it happend) and no one even from my pears didn't check on me. i tried to stand up an i could not. and i was like ""please tell me it's nothing serious"". then i crawled out of the field and started chatting with my teacher..at least that was fun. after that long story short it was somethink that needed a medical help and an ambulance came to pick me up. it was a fun ride at least. i got in to the hospital with my teacher we waited and chatted a little. then we were asked to get into the medical room and they put a fucking plaster on my leg. it was like i knew it was serius but man. my first sprained ankle. my first ambulance ride and now first fucking plaster. great. we come back and some things happen like i had a romm on a first floor so the needed to fucking transport mi an antire floor. before that the man at the gates to the property didn't want to let us pass because he was thinking that i was a fucking pizza delivery. like god. i had to come like 100 meters without crutches so my teacher asked the boys to help me out. and they did we chatted a little and the funny thing is that i needed to be the center of attention to not being a ghost.but ok fast forward a little and we are at home i didn't want to go to school witch a leg in a plaster and cruches why. 1 my depression.2 social anxiety (i don't recall when it developed but it is such a pain inmy ass). so i was staying at home again. and was feeling miserable again that ofc something needed to happen to me when i tried to get things straight but ok that's fine. fast forward a few months like last 2 to 3 months of school my attendence is a joke and i need to do something about it so this time i did everything i could to pass this grade and to my suprise it worked.and in the meantime i developed a crush on a classmate. we were talking like all the time. i walked her to home to have a little bit of more time with her i tried to be as attentive as i could and respectful of her viewpoints. but after hanging out with her a few times going in a date, going to her house. i was like yea my life is good right now i gone up in grade. was thinking that got myself someone that likes me and respects me. and after like a week of no contact she said ""i found someone else i don't want you to talk to me."" oh god it hurts still like i know i'm not the best but i just didn't want to know that this way. like why she go out with me on a date. or why she invited me to her house. idk. maybe it was bad communication,(it wasn't great in last weeks of it) maybe idk it still makes sad. like it hurt me so much because i tried to let go of the emotions that i keep stored in my heart. that i trusted her that she would be gentle with them. but i just gotten hurt instead. and the circle end there like, it's december almost and my attendance is a fucking joke again, and i don't want to go to school even. its just that it hurts like hell to see someone from school. not to mention her. instead i got into pc again and my life is blank again, truth be told i meet i think the best woman in my life. she is great. she plays with me. she gives me advices. and is listning to what i'm thinking. she gives me safe space i craved for such a long time and it's because of that i feel i didn't offed myself yet but it's not enough i'm just going insane in a past few days. i want to talk to someone irl, i want to touch someone irl. i want to hug someone irl. everything seams like shit again. but i want to just give up. it's to much for me. it's just to much for me to always wear my mask of being friendly and funny i just don't want to i just want someone to like the way i'm. but for now i will still wear it as to not being so idk embarassed about my runt so i thank everyone that read all of that mess of a massage but i would be greatful for your opinions and if i can get into some things that i didn't now i would be glad to help :)",1

I used to feel like I shouldn't exist or should trade places with my late friend but now I don't,"TW-Suicde 
For two years I dealt with Suicidal ideation after graduating community college and losing a friend in 2019 which I had bottled up a lot of my grief because it was to painful but back to the story it colluminated in me attempting suicide on three separate occasions and later I voluntarily check myself into a inpatient facility and my only regret was not going sooner. After being released from the facility on September 24th I slowly began to realize that people really did care about me or remember me I was just to blind to see it and I am thankful I am still alive and good support network and feel sorrow for anyone who doesn't have a support network but I hope some of you find the strength to live on as I did and I know it isn't easy but I truly hope you can find it in yourself to find something to live for no matter how small.",1
End of the rope,"Truthfully, I don't care about absolutely anything. I feel nothing but dread and fear from the moment I open my eyes every single day, the emptiness never ends.

No one can say anything to make me feel better or care about life. That's my short sob story. Thanks",1
"I wanna live, I just don’t know from where to begin.","First of all, i’m brazilian so english is not my first language.

I’m depressed since god knows how much time. When I was 14y my mom decided that something was up and began to look for psychological help for me. Now i’m 21y (btw i’m a woman) and after five different doctors, some visits to the ER, and many therapists I still don’t know my diagnostic. The first one said it was just the “teenage hormones”, then it was depression, anxiety, BPD, Borderline, and some other hypotheses. I have talked with a psychiatrist, a gynecologist (could be something with my cycle), a neurologist and NOTHING. 

After all that, after no idea with what I have besides depression, after trying a bunch of meds I’m still like this.

It’s so frustrating. Everything feels so hard for me to do. I’m tired all the time. Physically tired and mentally tired. Feels like something is pushing me down and I’m not a believer but even pray I tried.

Yes, my life is fucked up. But not enough to make a person go so down. I live with my parents, I work and help at home. I have friends. I have my boyfriend who’s an amazing person. But at the same time I dropped the 4th Graduation. I cry almost everyday and i’m tired all the time. I’m weird and I KNOW that. My mind is 800km/h and every suicide thought is not about the empty feeling people talk about. It’s the opposite of that. I’m full of feelings and tiredness and agony every minute of my life since ever. Sometimes I just want every light go dark, every sound stop, every feeling and emotions go calmer.

Someone feels like that? please tell me how to stop.",1
my snowy driveway,"the snow outside is so beautiful. and im so sad, im so very sad. 

i dont even know what to tell you. sitting on the couch in my living room with some of the heaviest melancholy ive ever felt sitting on my chest while also not being able to not watch how pretty the snow is, falling down. and in my deepest thoughts a little light lit up on the opposite hill and i thought for a sec that maybe im not sad alone and i wished the best to that person so why cant i wish the same to myself. 
bcs it is 6am and im so very lonely yet i dont want anyone to tell me a word i dont want anyone to hold me and i dont want to love as im so very scared of making more attachments in this fucking place. i wanna walk the snowy driveway forever and alone, without ever having to be somewhere else and without feeling guilty about it. 

i want to cry my eyes out about how absolutely horrible and beautiful this is yet i bottled everything up so well all i have left is anger and i just dont want to be angry anymore. i dont have any energy left for the utter rage that sometimes comes up to the surface. the rage that just wants to break shit and people's noses. ive never drank so much b4 as it made me sleep better, now it just helps me to blur my thoughts which are still so sharp they can reopen my healed scars so easily and im scared of how great of a sharpener sobriety is. 

and the sun is coming up and i wish the morning never came bcs i cant bear pretending to be human anymore. the world is waking up and i dont want to. 

just reading through this subreddit would be more than enough for me to cry if i fucking could, i am so so sorry if anyone else feels like this. i hope you all find peace sooner than the eternal peace finds you.

i have no idea what to do anymore. and i for sure dont know what the hell ill do when my dog dies. anynone else?",1
Incomplete emotions,"I honestly am not sure whether this is depression or not, but I'm coming here to see if anyone else knows what I'm talking about or can relate at all. I hope this is not too strange of a post to make.

I've started to suspect that I can't actually experience real emotions, but rather that I've just become very good at mimicking those of other people. I'm fine-tuned to the emotions of the people around me due to my past (I think), and it feels (ha!) as if I choose to display the ones most likely to please others. It's becoming enervating. Am I just a people pleaser? 

One way to explain it is that it's like when you're dreaming and you pinch yourself, you never get to feeling actual pain. It's just a dull sensation that *almost* reaches pain but never quite gets there. Another way is to draw the likeness of my mind to that of a room, where each feeling was a piece of furniture. Now it just echoes; it's vacant. I don't feel nothing, but I don't feel anything to its full extent either. Each emotion is incomplete and quite frankly it mainly irritates me. It's like an itch that I can't scratch, no matter who I spend time with or what I do. 

Can anyone relate? Is this ""normal""?",1

Short story about my childhood abuse,"The Ornamental Apple Tree 



You held me in your hands, your precious little seedling. You promised to look after me, water me and feed me. You planted me right where you could see me, in front of the kitchen window of that bright big blue house. 

As I grew up I was excited to see you look out your windows and see me grow into a big tree, to impress you with all my fruition. 

As time went by you stopped watering me and you stopped feeding me, how was I supposed to grow into the big beautiful tree I had wanted to become for you. 

As the weeks and month went on i told myself you were just distracted, that you would come back to love and care for me. I tried to get your attention, I grew new foliage for you, and I grew flowers for you, but that wasnt enough to get your attention.

You never came outside anymore. You spent all your time withdrawn inside, with your doors and windows shut letting no one else inside. The wind howled against the window pain but you did not answer, the sun crept through your windows but eventually you shut it out too. 

The doors were bolted closed and the blinds shut, I wondered why you didnt want see the outside world, see me. Feel the wind in your hair and the sun beaning down on your face. As I watched the house was no longer the bright blue I had remembered it to be growing up, it had a slight grey tinge to it. You ignored me even after I had I grew into a fully grown tree. I wanted to give you what you wanted but I couldnt fruit without your attention and love. 


As the winter months came I slowly lost hope, dropping all my leaves one by one falling to the ground like tears rolling down my face. I began to wonder, could you see me out your window or where they too clouded by the inside world, by other more important distractions then me. 


As time passed I realised that I was never going to get the attention I wanted and needed to provide you with my fruition.

 Maybe this is who I was supposed to be, maybe some of us are supposed to be just ornamental apple trees.",1
Where do these feelings come from?,"I've been watching a lot of TV, and reading a lot lately (in an effort to push down the feeling of dread I get whenever I have a test, or homework, or just need to study. Needless to say, it's making things worse). So many of my favorite characters, are great people but carry a lot of trauma baggage. The same could be said for a lot of people I know. My parents for instance. They're good parents. I don't have mommy issues or daddy issues. My siblings are okay. Nobody close to me died suddenly. I wasn't abused in any way that I can think of.  


But I feel like shit. And the only thing I can trace my thoughts, feelings, and actions to, is me. I'm a horrible person. My mom confirmed it about 3 weeks ago when she said everything I've ever thought about myself to me out loud. It hurt. She wasn't wrong though.  


Yet here I am. Doing the same things. I don't even know if I can say I'm trying anymore. Sorry. Just wanted to rant. I realize you can't ""pin your depression on trauma."" I don't mean to offend anyone whose struggling with actual problems.",1

Can a really bad case of ringworm potentially cause me to develop depression,"I’ll try and keep it short but in June, I randomly got a massive ringworm patch on my arm. Got my first cream in July, nothing I got worked until late September I got some pills and a new cream. There was 2 weeks worth of pills and but the last one it was almost completely gone. Told me dermatologist I wanted one last refill and she told me no. It immediately came back after I quit taking them and I finally got some more a week ago, but 2 days ago out of no where, it started spreading everywhere. And I am exhausted doing anything and have lost passion to do anything. Can the toll of having a massive ringworm patch that it’s 24/7, screwed over my mind and I’m finally feeling the toll of it. Part of me is also so mad at my derm since it was almost completely gone. Then they wouldn’t let me get more of the only thing that has helped me. Can this be why?",1
No se como sentirme,"Hoy ha sido un buen dia
Estábamos celebrando los 15 de una amiga
Todo estaba bien al principio pero poco a poco comencé a sentirme excluido. Es como algo inevitable para mi, no digo que no disfrute mi soledad sino que es un poco doloroso que todos te dejen de lado y no te busquen a pesar de todo el tiempo que hallas estado allí para ellos, trate de unirme varias veces y parecía funcionar, pero de alguna u otra manera me alejaba, fue muy raro y triste ver como todos se lo pasaban bien. Pero mientras ellos estuvieran bien. Todo estaba bien,
Pasaron las horas y seguía igual, trataba de juntarme con el grupo y acababa fuera otra vez y otra y otra y otra vez. No se si es por que incómodo a todos o por que no se dieron cuenta.
Pero no deja de ser triste para mí. Fui con mi mejor amigo. El estaba con los demás y hablamos
Un rato, después el le dijo a un chico si quería bailar, el le respondió que no y luego yo le dije que podíamos bailar juntos, sabes para no hacerle sentir mal ni nada. Pero el me dijo que no si era conmigo. Esas palabras dolieron, pero dolieron de verdad, yo soy una persona muy muy muy sensible, lo admito. Le dije que desde que estaba con su novia no era el mismo que desde que nos conocimos. Me dijo que era por mi, por que siempre era lo mismo, por que siempre quería estar con el, y que tenía que cambiar, la verdad pensé mucho en esas palabras, dolieron adentro, muy muy adentro. Aún me duele mucho, ¿hacia falta decírmelo así? No lo sé pero ahora veo que estoy siendo muy dramático, pero si, estoy muy mal ahora. No se por que pero oírlo de el fue el detonante para alejarme más del grupo. No volví a estar con ellos, me quedé pensando mucho, ¿por que tengo que cambiar?¿por que no puedo ser yo mismo con mis amigos?, ¿soy un mal amigo?
No lo se y eso me come mucho la cabeza y me hace sentir mal, no sé si mañana estaré mejor. Ojalá que si",1

I’ve been taking stock and reflecting a bunch,"So I’ve been depressed for 7 almost 8 years now. It’s gotten worse but I finally talked to my parents about it.

I realize how fucky my mind state is now after this chronic depression. I guess I realized back then but now it feels like I have slightly more clarity.

I used to be ambitious but after a few challenges I couldn’t measure up to and a torpor I couldn’t shake I became increasingly weak, frustrated, and self loathing.

From school, to life, family, and work — I’ve dealt with stuff that left me feeling worse, and more bed ridden. I’ve been able to get out and about and work. Hell when I first started 3 years ago I was the guy working stupid hours at a low wage to make more money. 

But now my parents pushed me to school, i understand where they’re comin from and don’t disagree, I have been in software dev for a 2 year diploma. 

This is where the reflection bit comes in, sorry for the long preamble. This is obviously a challenging degree, and although at one point I was proud of my intelligence, after years of depression I am not happy with much and my capabilities have greatly decreased. 

I’m getting shit done and getting good grades, admittedly using AI not as effectively/responsibly as I could be. But I feel like I’m pulling myself out of a wreck after and during each assignment to get shit done.

It feels unbearable, but I also lash myself thinkin I’m a drama Queen about this.

If I struggle doing this now how am I going to succeed in a much more challenging position at a job? Or at the very least later semesters?

I don’t know boss, my mind feels like it’s in a place it can’t bounce back from. I’ve been trying, but oh fuck I keep falling and the realization of how shot my mind is, with little to no prospect of growth, is terrifying.

I love my parents and as much as I want to die immediately I will dip out after they do. It’s tricky cause everyday I wake up upset I’m alive and get much sadder looking at my day to day and future. And I seem to get worse the longer I stay, I cherish and make sure my parents know I love them and they’re my everything, but I’ve been terrible before I got penitent with them and would rather die than have them suffer me.

They don’t want me to go, and honestly I don’t, I’ve been a pussy in my previous attempts, but everyday I can’t help think that me not being here would be better for me and my fam. I’ve been thinkin of it as suicide as evolved biological behaviour 

I could change diplomas, that’s probably a reality, but you have to understand what that uncertainty and failure does to me, it fucking wrecks me internally.",1
Having suicidal thoughts,"I'm only still here because of my kids. 

I have no support, no family, failed relationships.

Is this normal?,"I’ve been feeling so down these past few weeks, I can’t do anything even if I have a lot of schoolworks to do, I am overthinking everything and making scenarios in my head, and I cry in an instant whenever I think about something and it just goes on for hours then I’ll stop crying and then repeat. I feel so restless although I have a complete sleep and I’ve been having negative thoughts lately. I have experienced this before for years but it’s not consistent. There are times that I am happy especially when I am with my friends and then after that phase I’d spiral down again. It’s like a cycle so I decided to get check online and I am diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder and was prescribed antidepressants, but when I woke up this morning I didn’t cry and I feel kind of better. Is this normal? should I get a f2f consultation and should i take the antidepressants I was prescribed?",1
Anti depressants,"I myself take anti depressants, and have benefitted from them. My husband has been taking them for 2 weeks and for the first time, he sorted our socks, for first time he asked for help, for the first time my suggestion was taken as a suggestion and not a demand, for the first time he said ""Lets go out Im feeling depressed."" 

Thank you medication, thankyou.",1
How do I approach my dad about his depression?,"Just as the title says. My, (18m) dad (66m) has been depressed his whole life. It really turned a head when I moved out to college and my mother, (51f), his ex wife, got remarried a month ago. Ever since then, the self-hatred comments, the ""I hate my life"" comments, even a few suicide jokes have gotten me really concerned. I don't know who to go to or how to help him. I am thinking about trying to do an intervention, where I sit down and try to talk to him about this and push him into therapy, but since I am at university majority of my time, and it' a bit of a drive to get home, I really don't have a lot of options. How do I help him? As far as I know he's already on anti-depressants. 

  
For a bit of background: he can't retire, my brother (21m) and (16f) siblings rely on him, but he's unhappy with his job, he's in chronic pain due to a stomach condition, and as far as I know, he really doesn't have any friends or family besides me and my siblings. Not a great combination.

What can I do to help? I love him more than anything.",1
Feels like no one really cares about me,"29, still living with parents, stuck in a dead end job, struggling to get my mind in the right place so I can focus on important things and get a better job. 

A few years ago, on a very dark day where I was just minutes away from ending it all, I had promised myself that I would continue to live just for my parents as they don't deserve a hole in their hearts for my failures. But it is hard for me to keep that promise to myself... All I want to do is give them a better life and take them on vacations, good places to eat, it's the least I can do in return for all that they've done for me. 

Reason for ending it all: I have developed a habit of TMS (Traumatic masturbatory syndrome) since I was a kid and didn't even know what masturbation was.. I can't satisfy women now as my body doesn't find that movement pleasurable. So I've built this little social prison where I don't make eye contact with any girl ever because ultimately she will be disappointed in me and it's gonna end up being a mess and a waste of time for her.

What I really need from you guys here are some inputs on how you people focus on important things amid this chemical imbalance in the brain and all the stress. All I want is to earn enough to give my parents a good life before it's their time to go. Sorry for the long post.",1
I've tried.,"I have been suffering from depression for most of my life and recently I was diagnosed with bpd. I have tried to ask for help from friends and doctors. Went through therapy of all sorts, currently on meds and yet this sinking feeling of sadness and melancholy are so ever present. There is not a day I don't think about suicide and despite following a lot of the advice I was given (good or bad), nothing seems to change. 
There is always that voice in my head showing me how I should kill myself and constantly telling me to do it.

 I'm tired of it.

I am starting to think I won't reach an age where I will see my hair turning grey because this is too damn much already.",1
I am lost,"I am just so lost with what to do in life. I have absolutely be average grades, a girlfriend, a pretty supportive family, and I’m going to college on a premed track but I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been feeling severely depressed and so burnt out for months because I dont really know if this is right for me. I do not know if I dont feel right in my decision for premed or what I just am so lost. I want to have a comfortable and happy life. I don’t want to be the richest but I also don’t want to have to struggle for money. I just want to be happy in doing something I love. I don’t know if this is a cry for help or what I just need something. Support, suggestions anything helps. I try to stay positive but I just can’t seem to pull myself out of it this time.",1
Why am I crying?,"I was just at the dinner table with my 10 year old little sister, and she showed a song that she found on YouTube. So she just discovered the Duck song. Great! An Internet classic.

But for some reason I started tearing up. I had to hold it back because I didn't want to cry in front of my mom and lil sis (obviously). I finished my food at that point, so I excused myself and went to my room.

I'm not depressed, but I'm pretty sure that I used to be. During COVID and online school, I just felt so alone. There were many nights when I would cry myself to sleep, be that because of school, the world or my parents being in the process of a divorce. I think I was depressed, but I don't want to self diagnose.

I think I cried right now because of nostalgia. I remember being in the third grade listening to the Duck song with my friends. But I also think I thought about how the Internet is different from the 2000's-2010's vs now. Which made me think of how the world was different. And man was it a better place.

There was no war in Ukraine or Israel. The stock market wasn't crashing. People seemed smarter. Everything just seemed more okay. Ever since 2020, this world has turned to nothing but shit. And I can't do anything because I'm only 14. I have zero power over anything.

Why am I crying? It's just a song about a duck who wants grapes. It's just a song from better times. I want to share this with people, but because lots of kids my age go through emo phases and fake having depression for attention, nobody is listening. Or at least, nobody wants to listen.

So now I lay in bed and cry, and I think my depression is back.

Thanks for listening to my little rant.",1

How to Make Sense of and Process Grief of Losing Years of My Life to Depression and Nervous Breakdown,"This is going to be long. I wish I had reached out here years ago, instead of isolating completely. I want to write all of this out to get it out of my head and hopefully move on from the negative experience. I understand not wanting to read through this wall of text. Perhaps someone, someday might come across this and know they are not alone and that someone else has completely lost their mind as well.

I went through a painful breakup at the beginning of 2020. The breakup itself was long and drawn out and lasted from the beginning of the year through March. I still don't know if what I experienced was narcissistic abuse, or just a traumatizing breakup, but I felt pretty broken afterwards. Still, I was able to start doing normal things, like going out on a date even if I didn't feel like, signing up for a climbing class, etc. The pandemic then went into full swing around that time (mid-March) with all things closing in the area I was living at the time. Climbing class canceled. My routine completely disrupted and my #1 way to keep depression at bay, working out, was taken away as studios all closed. Even hiking trails and beaches were off limits for some time, compounded by wildfire smoke. I felt isolated. I didn't have a strong social network to begin with, as I've typically put all of my eggs into one relationship basket. I became confused, simultaneously fearing going near anyone even with a mask on, to thinking it was ridiculous to not be able to go outside and breathe air. My anxiety was through the roof. I became sort of obsessed with the idea of moving to a different city, even though making a big life change in that mental state and after a loss was a terrible idea, at the time I thought I would improve my life. I also became obsessed with the FIRE and saving money, which led to me moving to a city and state that I had lived in several years prior that I hated, because I became obsessed with saving money, lowering taxes, and buying a home. I had no one to talk to, so I went deeper and deeper into this weird, anxious, preoccupied with making a change energy. The ex and I didn't speak for one month, after which he attempted to initiate contact and was reaching out consistently for the next 9 months. Despite being in complete despair, shock, and miserable without him, I felt frozen and couldn't/wouldn't respond. I regret that decision, as I believe interacting with him could have saved me from moving and further destroying my life and mental health. 

Rather than do what I should have done, which was take advantage of the mass exodus out of the city I was living in at the time, to secure my dream flat at a discount, and to reunite with the man I loved and lost who came back and was persistent in his attempts to re-engage, and to take advantage of the natural beauty that surrounded me and just do outdoors stuff while gyms were closed, and where I at least had a couple of friends and a few acquaintances, I sank further into crazy and packed up all of my belongings and moved halfway across the country to a city I already knew I would hate living in, in a climate that is totally incompatible with my lifestyle and comfort, and where I knew zero people. 

I rented a place sight unseen, which ended up being the worst place I had ever lived. All of the adjacent yards of this townhouse had dogs, which were left outside to bark, sometimes all day and night. There was a very mentally unstable woman in a unit on one side who would bang on walls and scream and leave threatening notes on my door despite the fact I had never talked to nor interacted with her, and on the other side, a couple who would blast their music with bass. Because I was so obsessed with hoarding money for whatever reason at that point and buying a house, I refused to move out (I normally wouldn't sacrifice comfort/sleep to stay somewhere if I didn't need to) even though moving would have been a simple solution. I stayed in that hell hold for 1.5 years, even after the year lease was up. Please note that I have a good job and am fortunate that I could have easily just moved out. My mental health at that point had completely deteriorated. I wouldn't leave the house for weeks at a time (I had never not left the house at least once per day until that point), I was binge eating and drinking bottles of wine, watching true crime and paranormal reenactment shows, obsessively looking to buy a house, not exercising at all, completely letting myself go (previously was super in shape and my looks important to me). I basically gave up on life. I was still in shock I guess from the breakup and had PTSD from the living situation. It's hard to explain, but doing something as simple as sending an email, Google searching for a doctor, or making a simple decision was too much for me. All I could do was lay on the sofa and binge eat and watch TV. I believe chronic, compounded stress was also a factor. Like my nervous system became so dysregulated that I couldn't function. My cat was also stressed by the housing situation, and he became increasingly vocal, howling at the top of his lungs, which was distressing and overwhelming. It was either hot as hell or freezing cold, so the closest thing to exercise I got was occasional walks around the neighborhood.

I had tried a couple of antidepressants in the past, and had mild side effects. I was super health conscious prior to the mental breakdown, so I wanted to avoid putting anything into my body/needing something. I thought of it as a bandaid rather than treating the root cause. Despite my life being a total trainwreck at this point, I still would not consider taking medication, which makes absolutely no sense to me now. I had had pretty good results with one med in particular years prior, but it gave me a mild headache and made me a bit talkative, so I didn't ask my doctor for a script. Looking back, how is a mild headache and being a bit more outgoing worse than having brain fog so thick I couldn't think, not being able to get out of bed for weeks at a time, and going from panic attack to panic attack? I still am confused by just how dysfunctional my thinking had become. Totally isolated, I had no one to talk some sense into me, or come save me from myself.

At this point, my doctor recommended ketamine infusions, because I told him that I had not had good results with medications, which at the time I probably believed was true. So, I spent 2-3 months getting ketamine infusions, thinking it would cure me or was a magic bullet. The infusions actually did help, but results lasted about 3 days and then you have to go for more. I think I was also sort of using the experience as a way to escape reality. The altered state I was in was better than the nightmare that had become my existence. I don't know if this was the severe depression, or a result of too much ketamine, but life sort of lost meaning. I used to always have a higher goal or purpose, even if it was to be in the best shape or love or a relationship, that would drive me even on the darkest days. Thanks to my journeying experiences, I came to realize that life means nothing and nothing is real or feels real. Winter 2021 was an especially low point for me. At this point, I had full on agoraphobia, couldn't have a normal conversation with anything, was bewildered and confused and shock most of the time, and couldn't make a simple decision let alone get my life together and move back to my previous city.

I had the opportunity after 1 year in that new city to leave, but I had lost my mind at that point. I moved from one shitty place to another. To a house that wasn't cleaned or made ready, had a roach problem, and was a total dump. The slumlord was incredibly rude and unhelpful. All I had to do was move right out and could later pursue having him cover my move fees since the house was not even close to being in a condition that was appropriate for renting, but my mentally ill and traumatized brain somehow convinced me that it was a good decision to stay. The house was quiet, and after 1.5 years of barely sleeping and being traumatized by constant dog barking and loud music and door slamming and unstable woman next door harassing me, I was able to sleep. So I guess I didn't care if the house was filthy, because at this point I had given up on life anyway and just wanted to rest.

Rather than get my shit together and move out of the house at minimum and to a clean normal place, I gave up. I wasted another 8 months of my life in that city and house. At this point, I was still in shock but my shock from the breakup was replaced by shock around how much time I had wasted, how I felt stuck and unable to make any decision or move, and how my body had changed. Rather than use this as motivation to make a change, I became more depressed and confused and anxious. Finally, beginning of summer 2022, I at least find the motivation to exercise, by going on long walks around a lake, the only nature I could find. I notice I am feeling slightly better and feel hopeful. Of course, that month, after years with one manager at work and no issues, I get a new manager, who hates anyone who doesn't look like him as well as women, and I become the target of his harassment at work. I had to go through the whole HR process, which ended in retaliation, and I lost what was left of my mental health at this point. This experience, which lasted 1 year, aged me exponentially due to the chronic stress, lack of sleep, and severe PTSD and anxiety it caused. I absolutely regret not having just left, but I was worried about impending layoffs in the industry and didn't want to be without health insurance or income. I convinced myself that the only thing worse than the state of my life at that point would be that state of my life unemployed. So I forced myself to stay, experiencing psychological abuse, gaslighting, being undermined, and walking on eggshells for nearly a year. Around this time, after being on a waitlist for nearly 2 years, I am diagnosed as being on the Autism spectrum (level 1). I had suspected this since about 2015 and a previous therapist had pointed it out to me.

At this point, I feel trapped and stuck and don't know up from down. I can't decide which city to move to, and waste all of my free time dissociating or researching where to live, instead of just packing my things and moving anywhere else. I finally muster the energy to move out of the roach house, and rent an apartment on a month to month lease, intending to stay 3 months. 3 months turned to 11 months. 

Around May of 2023, my doctor suggests medication. At this point I have nothing left to lose, so I agree. I instantly feel better. It doesn't solve everything, but I'm able to wake up and leave the house, get things done, the spiraling negative thoughts have decreased, and I can see a light for the first time in years. I feel so much shame and grief that I could have saved 3 years of my life (3 years!!), the tail end of my youth and beauty and sanity, by just taking a medication. A medication that I had taken years prior and felt better on, but my neuroses convinced me that I should stop taking. 

The doctor who diagnosed me with Autism suggested that what I was experiencing was an autistic shutdown. My therapist said it was a complete collapse. My psychiatrist said it's treatment resistant depression. I feel had a full on nervous breakdown, as a result of chronic stress, disruption to my routine and going from exercising all the time to being completely sedentary for years (to the point of muscle atrophy and nerve pain in my legs), isolation, and extreme confusion and shock around the breakup. I feel I will never be the same after the past 3 years. I feel I am unrecognizable when I look in the mirror. I should not have aged this much in just 3 years. In fact, the aging really occurred as a result of the workplace harassment. Before that, it was just some weight gain and looking tired. Now my body, face, skin, everything has changed. I am not the same person. I don't recognize myself.

In June of 2023, I took an extended break from work, removing myself from the toxic environment. In October of 2023, I finally moved back to my previous state. I still don't fully understand what happened to me. I've struggled with anxiety and depression my entire adult life, yet I was resilient, in tune with nature and my intuition, and would make decisions that felt good. I didn't date for 4 years. I barely had any human contact. I look and feel completely different, not in a good way. I feel like I have brain damage from the stress and isolation. I feel I wasted the end of my 30s laying in bed. When I mention this confusion to therapists or acquaintances, they say the pandemic caused collective trauma, or that pandemic depression was real. However, I don't personally know of anyone else who quite literally did not get out of bed or leave the house for 3 years. Who had no positive social experience for that long. Who didn't date, have human touch or contact. Who did literally nothing other than sit slumped in bed watching Netflix to dissociate from the nightmare that had become my reality, who couldn't function like a normal human.

I don't know where to begin even trying to process what happened to me. I am genuinely curious what type of mental illness this experience falls under. Surely it can't just be depression? I have so much grief for the life I could have had had I just stayed put in my previous city and taken small steps to feeling better and riding out the initial year of the pandemic and then resuming normal life in a place I loved and could thrive in. The decisions I made over the past 3 years baffle me. I do not know who I am anymore. My self-esteem is non-existent. I tried dating recently and due to having lost touch with reality for so long and not knowing be a normal person anymore, it did not go well. I went off the grid for so long I lost touch with the few friends I had. I no longer have youth and my looks and attractive body, and I don't know how to undo that.

I know this all sounds like complaining and whining, but it's the first time I've really shared this. I feel like I have wasted too much time and feel confused and lost. I'm grateful for the medication, for being back in the state I love living in, but I'm concerned my brain is permanently damaged from the past 3 years. I've tried doing Google searches for others having had a similar experience. How do I move on from this? Where do I even begin trying to put my life back together, now in my 40s, single, no confidence, no social network, and not feeling or looking like myself. It's as though time stood still for me those 3 years and I was trapped in a prison/nightmare of my own making.

I just want to feel normal again. Like myself. How do you process the grief and trauma of losing years of your life to an unknown mental illness? I try not to think about it, because it's too depressing. I see others have lived full lives during the pandemic, thrived, and their lives improved and went on as normal. I think it's reasonable that I spent 2020 indoors and kind of confused, but it didn't need to turn into a multi-year experience. I don't know how to get over having wasted and ruined my life.",1

I dress my pillows in used clothes so I don't feel alone,"I'm a little sad, I'd like someone to talk to me, but I guess I'd also like someone to find this kind of funny.   


One of the strangest and most humiliating things in my routine, every time I go to bed I can't stop fantasizing about having someone by my side and hugging me. This trend led me to dress my pillows in used clothes to smell my own body odor and not feel so alone. It helps me a little   


I go to therapy and take meds. I am better than many months ago, I washed my clothes and sheets frequently again, sometimes I fantasize about going back to work and even returning to my ideal weight, somehow.

I hate being sensitive,"Recently, I’ve been hating leaving my room. So I don’t. Unless I’m really hungry.

Today was the same case, I got out of my room around 1 am. My stepdad was still awake but it’s whatever, he didn’t talk to me that much. I made rice in the rice cooker and went back in my room. The next time I went out again was 4 hours later and my stepdad talked to me about not leaving the rice cooker plugged in because it’s dangerous (which is unlikely but I guess fair enough). I told him I’ll keep an eye on it more next time. 

I’m back in my room and idk…I don’t know why I’m so sensitive that my first reaction is that I should’ve just never left in the first place. I’ll just sacrifice eating more so that I don’t have to deal with anything.",1

Had an amazing night last night on ecstasy with my crush and now I’m home feeling alone and sad,"
(First time ever using) I’m assuming this a side effect of the drug. I remember doing research and basically your first time kind of is your best time 
.. I felt free, I felt like everything was fine.
 and I had the time of my life. I felt really good being on the dance floor with my crush and it was a moment I didn’t want to end, then we ended things at his place and it was enjoyable. Later on in the day the drug wore off and I felt depressed all over again and I swore to myself while I was under the influence of the pill I’d control it. I was still at his house but eventually I had to go home and I didn’t want to. I’m home now and feel really sad about life in general.

I just want that feeling back again, I felt alive for the first time. No anxiety, no negative self talk, no overthinking, just living.",1
Feel dismissed about depression from my therapist,"Have you ever felt misunderstood/dismissed by your therapist

I've had depression symptoms for 3 years. I'm 21 now and have struggled with feeling low and down my whole life pretty much but in the past 3 yrs is when everything got worse. I also went through a bit of childhood trauma which is the main thing I've been discussing with my T. I told her I really struggle between sessions and I lay in bed for hours physically unable to get up because of the sadness I feel. I told her it feels like a constant weight on me that drags me down and doesn't allow me to do anything. She said have you tried antidepressants. I said no because im already taking quite a few meds for other things. She said she doesn't think they would help me anyways. Then she says ' sometimes when people are really so low they can't meet me in order to do this therapeutic work. I'm not sure that's going on for you. You can meet me emotionally but I think it's very difficult for you due to shame' she's tried implying that she doesn't think I'm depressed in a couple of sessions now. She said once that you're very well groomed and beautiful. I usually put on a mask for everyone so no one knows anything is wrong. But i don't know what else to say for my T to understand and believe me. For me it's more of a feeling that I can't really describe

Have anyone felt like they would turn into an evil spirit when they die?,"so...have anyone here felt like their spirit after death wouldn't be how do i say this...the NICEST necessarily? im a somewhat good person yeah im sometimes rude, selfish and stuff but no ones a saint all the time let's be fr, however I've always did put an effort into not doing something sinister perse, my father ( read my piece of shit dead beet father) however was a bad person considering today's society standards, he would steal, assault women sexually and mentally, left his toddler siblings when his parents died to come to the city, would always beat my mom and would uh...kinda write curses for other people on paper and sell them, also claimed that in a particular time he was able to see/talk to supernaturals ( we are extremely poor btw so i doubt it bc if he did at least they would help him with idk something he wanted?) So when i was 6 he was arrested for selling drugs ( heroin and cocaine) and i was so happy i wouldn't have to see my mom bloody and beaten anymore, hw was released in 2010 after 7 years tho, at the time i was 11/12 , he immediately started his assault on my mom ( more mentally and verbally rather than physically) and i was scared and silent until i was 14 by then i started talking back and when i was 17 i started hitting him, he became scared of me, at this time he was 65 and didn't have the energy for physical assault anymore, every time he would even open his ass mouth to say something to my mom i would hit and curse him asap, always prayed on his death, he died 6 month ago ( btw my mom was 22 and he was 40 when they got married just thought i have to point that out too) and we couldn't be happier, however now that i have the timw to actually know myself and look at myself ( cause up until now i dedicated my life to make his life miserable didn't have time to liv for myself) I'm realizing that i have some um sinister urges and maybe i had had them all along actually, i like seeing people get assaulted and physically hurt ( and sexually...it turns me um yeah) when i see a child i would wonder sexual things about them, i get thrilled when i see/read about wars and death's and i started stealing from supermarkets etc...I'm turning into that mother fucker, I don't want to, ii dont want my genes to define and ruin me and its so so hypocritical of me to turn into something i always despised and fought with, i went to trophy for 1 year, didn't improve even got worse, in the outside im a very calm almost depressed looking girl but its another story in the inside, i truly feel like my spirit is cursed maybe he...he sold my soul and was right about having relation with underworld afterall, i would kill myself but the thing is my mom doesn't have anyone to provide foe her and would kill herself after me AND i feel like i would um haunt people after my death bc the things inside me aren't resolved first...i didn't know where to post these I'm actually posting this on multiple subreddits, anywhere i could find one, to maybe see someone who would be similar/have a solution foe this...I'm scared of myself and my shadow, mental asylum also didn't work...i don't even know why they released me",1

How do i deal with my brothers depression?,"Hi, new here. My (22F) brother (22M) has severe depression with psychotic episodes and has been diagnosed for half a year. I may have mental problems but I never started to actively do something in that direction. 

So my twin brother and I are very close. We talk everyday on the phone. He had multiple tentatives of ending things, just two that I know of, the rest he doesn't talk about. 

Back home with my family when we were in highschool, the situation was very bad and this led to us having problems. I was passive, not wanting to fight with my parents, just wanting some peace, he was very active, reactive, and had a lot of fights with my parents (he wanted better living conditions and less neglect from my parents, I don't blame him, I wanted those things too). 

The thing is we are now 22, left home 3 years ago. I am a lot better than him, more positive, I don't have depression, I am more stable. He goes to the therapist, to the psychiatrist and takes medication. 

●The thing is: when he calls me he just want to talk about how the situation is very bad in our family. He just wants to understand why we didn't have what we needed. Why are our parents this way. Why did happen something like 4, 5, 6 years ago. I am very tired of that. I have managed to get better. I help him every way I can. I don't blame him. 

He just called me to basically tell me I caused him part of his depression and I am heartbroken. I explained to him why I acted how i acted in highschool (i was in fact on his side, protecting him from my parents as good as i could). I told him that I also had and have problems but he insists that his are much important or greater scale. 

I'm tired of talking with him about these things. I'm tired of getting blamed and belittled. 

I'm afraid he might do something bad if I tell him the wrong things.

Thanks for reading this. I wish you all the best.",1

Two years ago, this girl entered a relationship with another guy, and they continued to be connected for a year and a half, after which their relationship ended, and I am still spying in silence as I am. 9 years have passed and I am afraid of confrontation.

"This will probably get deleted due to low karma, but...","I'm 20, I have been through a lot. I'm severely mentally disabled, depression and anxiety for over 10 years. I also have a rough history with Aspergers and ADHD, and none of my psychiatrists take me seriously, so I'm often a mockery to them.

I need disability funds because I'm so far off the realm of ""alright"" that I cannot live as a normal person due to years of neglect and familial abuse (I still don't know what taxes are or how to cook majority of foods, I'm stuck on microwaved meals and quick to make foods like waffles)

I've been trying to get on disability all year, but my professional support is failing me. I'm about to face my second rejection due to unhelpful and stuck-up doctors who won't listen to my pleas (my doctor claimed that he could not find any history diagnosis of autism for me, despite the fact that I know the exact place I got diagnosed 13 years ago, so I feel like he botched by medical report form)

I tried to send it to them but the report got ignored, last night they sent me the automated email saying they ""haven't recieved my support form"" I sent it on November 14th.

I feel like a failure, I had to cut my toxic family out, I have zero mode of transportation or money in my wallet that isn't from disability support. I feel like I'm going to die here if this keeps going, I promised my friends I'd try to keep going but it seems life doesn't want me to even have the basic resources to do that.

Is all of my efforts pointless or should I keep trying?",1
I (f24) struggle with severe depression and anxiety. Seeking therapy in OC,I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 17-18 years old. Within this last year I’ve had such a severe increase of depression it’s crippled me. I have tried to fight against it and rise above my own mind but I can’t get out right now. Is anyone out there who can give me some advice on relief and things that help them almost in the moment? I feel so suffocated in my mind. Some days I feel like I can’t breathe. I wish I had a therapy group but I don’t know how to find one. If anyone in the Orange County area knows of a good therapy place please let me know,1

What do you do if nothing is enjoyable anymore and you have no hope?,"I feel nothing but sadness and depression every day. I want to improve, of course, but after going on for so many years like this it’s starting to feel hopeless. I’m usually not one to sulk in my own misery. I’ve been working hard for the past three years by hitting the gym, working a 9-5, going to school and practicing kickboxing but I still feel really miserable. I’ve even tried finding solace and making peace with this lonely, miserable existence but I just can’t do it. I might be feeling down because of the holidays. Most people get excited about the holidays but for me it just reminds me that another years passed without me really achieving anything or finding any happiness. The last time I was truly happy was when I was 12 years old playing video games with friends but whenever I go out with the few friends I have now it feels like a waste of time. I have no hope of meeting new friends or potential romantic partner because I’m an autistic, shy, introverted weirdo. The only girl that was willing to date me for a while ghosted me (the whole situation was terrible but that’s what hurt the most). That’s not even mentioning I haven’t met anyone new in like six years working at this shitty job as a waiter. I’m at my wits end. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m sick and tired of everything. I wish god would just cut me some slack and just toss me a bone every now and then. I wish I had a different life.",1

Chronic Depression/ anxiety disorders and stomach issues,"I have depression/anxiety/ suicidal ideation since i was 7 yrs old. Lately, I’ve been struggling with it more, especially, in the morning with dread rumination.

Loosing weight while depressed,"I’ve been depressed and on every type of meds as long as i can remember but the last 5 years i spent in bed and gained 50 kilos. I tried working over those years to at least move a little, socialize and of course make money, but i cant keep a job longer than a month, doesn’t matter if it’s physical or sitting in an office. So i just sit in bed and rarely leave my house. I cant walk 1km without feeling like im gonna die. I reached the point where i cant even look at myself, i dont want to be around people because of how i look, im even embarrassed to be seen by my mom. I kind of accepted that I’ll always have depression with me, but at the very least I don’t want to rot in my bed and look like that. Even if there’s days i want to go somewhere or do something, I don’t because of how I’ll look doing those things. So my number one problem to fix right now is to get back in shape but I really don’t know how and where to start. All “beginner workouts” on youtube really don’t feel like beginner friendly for me and it just makes me spiral more because I can’t complete even half of it and it’s unbelievably hard to find motivation to do so. Does anyone have any advice on how and where should I start? Thank you.",1
Sick of people turning me down over being numb.,"I've been diagnosed with many neuroses and I have ADHD with autism. It may start to get a bit obvious right there, but I struggle with social life.

I'm 17 years old female living in Central Europe. I think my symtoms of depression have started when I was around 9 years old. At 12, it got more intense and it's getting worse and worse. I've been medicated twice with SSRIs but I've cut them out myself. Basically, my bipolar and autistic symtoms and the overall severity of my neurosis made them really ineffective. I started to feel slightly borderline and overly energetic, so much that it became irrational. Now I need to wait till I'm 18 to get my meds, because it's complicated with children's psychiatrists, at least here. 

My depression is quite severe. Especially when it combines with OCD, I get suicidal on a daily basis. I would lay down on my bed at the time where I expected my mania to finally hit and make me super energetic once again. It didn't happen. I wanted to forget myself instead, and any thought I've had about me would give me a feeling of convulsions in my hands. I felt like the world is not worth me due to it's demanding standards and system, and began to think the only way to bypass them is through death.

Another way it has affected me is by becoming interpersonally numb. I've been avoiding relationships for the sake of planned success, but it made me detached. I don't treat this as an inherent disadvantage, but many people do. I feel like most simply leave me because I can't get attached. Why would I, anyway? I have the advantage of not being hurt, broken, or played with, while taking the control of a situation I'm in. I'm not necessarily talking about relationships, but also people leaving me altogether. It has just happened again - I wasn't in love, but I've got used to them. They left me because I've admitted I'm reckless in a way I can leave anytime I want, hence the ability to not get attached. 

So although I'm not attached, I've got used to them. Them leaving created some void in me and I know I can't make them aware of how I'm doing, even if I compensate them with somebody else with no problems. 

People are a way for my ADHD to give me some stimulation and attention, too, cause I need it. They don't realize we can't just be friends and have fun with each other, simply because they have the disadvantage of getting attached themselves. It's getting annoying, because it seems like they just leave me over this silly thing. I don't leave people over it, unless I become uninterested in interactions or get exhausted.

Honestly, this may break a little bit, and the more I live the more I wanna isolate. I keep being misunderstood if I try to discuss my problems and then get hurts even more. They almost all keep telling me everything will be fine as a small talk phrase.

Again, I don't have problems being indifferent rather than having problems with people having problems with my own indifference, instead of enjoying some time together.

How do I find people like me, and how can I manage the rest of my symtoms?",1
"IDGI; i'm doing everything right, why do i still feel this way?","23, ive been depressed since i was 16, but i have been taking steps to not feel so down and enjoying life for the more subtle things without the need for social interaction even without a job, and it seems that im on the right track and its also working to some extent, but i still feel like i just cant feel and be happy and i dont know why?

i suppose the reason being is that i have a defence mechanism that's similar to will's from good will hunting, i just throw people away before they have the chance to do anything against me because i dont wish to be heartbroken again and probably didnt recieve any of the love that i wanted from others?

then again, i usually just say ""fuck it, such is life"" and move on given that its the only thing that has kept me going since the future seems to look bleak...",1
How can I live with a painful decision?,"Over a year ago I had to make a choice between my daughter from a previous relationship or my wife and two sons.  My youngest son is just a baby and has autism.  I had to make a choice to leave where I was living and move many states away for a possible better life for my son's and my wife.  The decision killed a part of me that will never come back.  Most people say that about stupid shit.  But I literally mean it.  I was in physical pain and extreme emotional turmoil leading up to my choice.  Once I made up my mind, it got worse.  I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, nothing.  I starved for nearly a week.  When I had to take apart her bed in her room at our home I shattered.  I laid on the floor for an hour and cried to myself.  I felt lumps in my chest and throat.  It was a visceral pain.  One that even now just thinking about it makes me emotional.  I had to go with my newborn.  He needed me more.  And it's extremely fucked up to me to even say that to myself.  Needs me more.  They all need me the same.  They all need me.  My wife even gave me the option to stay but I refused.  But I know that he truly needs me to help more.  My daughter has her mother, step father, and many family members that love her and treat her very good.  I knew she'd be in more than  capable hands.  The choice though.  It still weighs on me.  Damned if I did, damned if I didn't.  There was no right choice.  No magic button.  No win.  She's recently stopped texting me back when I try to talk to her.  I know she's angry with me and hates me.  I don't blame her at all.  It's never stopped weighing on me.  Never stopped.  I think of her every day.  I wonder if I made the right choice.  It kills me.  A part of me is gone forever from what I did.  And now I fear I'll lose her.",1
I hate feeling stressed and numb,"I feel emotionally numb and I hate it a lot like I don’t feel happy anymore except when I’m asleep dreaming and when I wake up it’s just gone. I’m stressed out all the time and sometimes I just wanna sleep and not wake up because that’s when I’m happy and not emotionally numb. I wake up, force myself to stay up and shower, let my dog outside, go on indeed and apply for jobs so that way I can have some kind of income and break this damn cycle, and then clean and chill till my parents get home. I don’t understand why I can’t break this cycle like I’m tired of staying cooped up in this damn house all day but there’s nothing to do or anywhere to go because small town life. I’m 19 and I feel like a waist of space and I hate that I have no friends and I’m stressed out all the time but I know that the only person who can change it is me. Every night I lay in my floor listening to my playlist and look out at the window and just lay there and think about what went wrong with me and why I’m not like my sister who has an amazing job and a fiancé. I hope that one day I’ll finally get the cycle broken and I can live life the way I want to.",1
When the pills stop working..,"
I've been depressed my whole life but in the last few years i hit rock bottom multiple times. I went to the mental hospital for several months and they had to constantly increase my antidepressants. It's like there's no dosage for me that's working and my current medication is already maxed out. I'm legally disabled because of depression, anxiety etc. 
When i forget to take them i basically have 30 hours before i become extremely suicidal and it feels like the 'real' reality breaks through this fragile wall that the pills build. My life without meds is my reality. A reality that's just brutal because i can see my body rot caused by physical diseases. There is no cure for nothing and i can't wait to find the guts to follow my friend who left this suffering a few months ago.",1
(24f) how to distance myself from toxic parent without affecting my siblings?,"
I’m really sick and tired of my parent, and it getting to the point that I will be sitting in the same room and my parent is making up lies to making me look bad. She recently start talking to me bout how she would love to put her hands on me and in a few petty arguments she would grab me by my shirt . My parent was never someone who would hit us/spank us growing up but after coming back this July due to have sickness and mental issues , now it the new thing that she likes to threaten me and will lie to my aunties ,cousins, and siblings to make me look like a terrible person. There no such thing as regular conversation with this lady, if I avoid her , she snatches my phone (that she doesn’t pay for) she was went as far as to break the door ,so I’m can’t lock it, and say things that make my cousins look at me differently. As of a year ago I was in a car accident, rear ended by a commercial vehicle (which is one of the main reasons I had to move home) , was left with a lot of brain and neck injuries . My brother came to see me in the hospital . Fast forwarding to now , my brother has become distance and always has an attitude when I speak to him. He randomly had an outburst and accused me of drinking while I was driving that why I was rear ended . It was random n I was shocked that he even open his mouth to say that ,(which drinking while driving isn’t even in question). 

Two days ago it was thanksgiving and all my favorite cousins were veered off to the side talking it everyone but me and when I tried to add myself , everyone would get quietly and move to another part of the house. 
I made a previous post talking bout how my aunties treated me on a trip we were recently on.
And long story made short, from the car accident, I have a 6 figure check coming in soon and I’m planning on disappearing from my family. I got myself a life mentor and 2 therapist , pretty good health Insurance , and soon to have food stamps. 
I still want a relationship with my cousins and siblings and I’m not sure how to do that if the lies being spread while already affecting how my own family looks at me.

I also don't have any aim in life, just going on where my fate is taking me.I don't know when will that trigger point come when I will finally end my life because I'm not able to bear this much mental pain.

"I'm ""happy"" after 3 years struggling with it.","I've probably had it my whole life, but I was only diagnosed in late 2020. I don't know exactly when I got ""better"", but it was around either July or August.

Things are still scary, honestly. My life was ruined due to many things, including being raped by a male cousin and my mom's intensive abuse (that still continues to this day, even though it's less frequent). I live alone, but heavily relying on the money she sends me weekly while i'm doing a 2 years course about General Knowledge on IT (Leaning towards Programming, as I somewhat enjoy problem solving).

Living in Brazil, it's hell to find an actual job, either being formal contract or not. But I feel better than I've been at 2021/2022, where my mind would constantly think about hurting others and myself. I felt insane most of the time, and if I didn't improve my self-control back then, I probably would have done something bad.

Even though my life looks grim, as I still feel lazy, I'm enjoying things again so I guess it's a gooe thing. I guess i'm writing this to someone out there who might read this and maybe find out a reason to enjoy life again. I'm still on the way, and even if I don't make it to the end, maybe someone will.

Depression/No Social Skills/Asexual 29yr old Male,"I have had deep deep depression for a long time. Tried meeting new people and it never works out. I have even been told I have autism. I try to find silver linings but really the only one silver lining I have is that I trust someone for the first time n my life a health professional. The other health professional I worked with and trusted more than anyone I’ve encountered in my life actually used the phrase “You bum me out because you’re so negative” and now doesn’t see me as a client but still takes on clients. The question I have is where do I begin ? How do I know if I have autism as a 29 year old male I do have ADHD. I can’t make friends, have no family, most days I am lucky to just have heat and water. Is there hope to tackle meeting new people, a medical diagnosis of autism, generally being someone who struggles to speak and make conversation in daily life. All of that plus I came out to some people about being Asexual and that went as poorly as it could go. With a person I to,d playing video games online one night responding “If you’re Asexual, Anti-Social, and don’t trust people should you even live?” I hope this post finds someone with advice and maybe even general help because I feel I have reached the end of the road at most days if you know what I mean.",1

"[21 trans woman] Loneliness/isolation, work stress/job dissatisfaction, dysphoria, feel trapped, neverending angst, anxiety etc. Every day just feels agonizing.]","I've been crying myself to sleep probably one in gour nights this year. At some points, I'd drink a lot. 

At the end of January this year, my first love broke up with me. I was only with him 3 months but it was the most magical time of my life. Was so sad to see it end. It also made me realize how disconnected by distance with people I'd just started being friends with in college. 

College was kinda lonely for me until my last semester or so. I went back to my parents' place my second semester because I could because of covid to save money. Also rushed through it in 2.5 years and have a lot of anxiety, often social anxiety. My goal was to minimize debt and get through fast to really gain independence from my parents (car, etc) and get a job to fund my gender transition like surgeries, hair removal, etc.

College felt like starting over my social life which was overwhelming because I couldn't make friends the same way I did in high school  (stuff like talking at lunch, while waiting for the bus, sports, etc). I feel the same way all over again now, except where I'm at isn't full of college students, there isn't much nice stuff to do near me, some people in town have weirded me out. My life just feels like a joke.

I'm not going to go into details of my job, but it leaves me so stressed out. And its not an industry I'm interested. I only took it because it was the first offer I got, I have so much regret. I wish I lived in a city. It's so hard to meet people where I'm at. So little to do beyond just staying inside. The job itself is kinda meh, stuff I really have little interest in. Work in a very small team that's going to be just me for a few months in a month or so. Do a handful of additional random not-so-easy tasks that would usually be done by someone with a separate position and a lot of meeting with customers which stresses me out to no end. By the middle of the day I'm bordering on an existential crisis/starting crying a lot of the time, but have to hold back my emotions and just push myself through the day. I wake up feeling unexcited about life most days. And while I'd like to get out of the industry I'm in, I feel trapped by expectations to stay around for a few years to not be labelled a job hopper, my pending surgery, depression.

Growing up, my childhood was nice until I was 10 or so. My parents started fighting and bickering constantly (in a house where the walls resonate sound as if they are paper-thin). They'd fight on vacations and stuff, and we gradually stopped visiting extended family and stuff. The house was always a mess, thry have too many fights, frequent unjustified anger and crankiness. When I was 15, my best friend at the time killed himself. It tore me up. The next year, my social life fell apart a bit and I didn't feel as close to anyone as before then until more recently. I'd just focus on my classwork and extracurriculars, I'd go to school as early as I could and stay as late as I had an excuse for. But my life felt robotic, I'd designed my day to day to be like clockwork with just the goal of getting ahead as much as I could anf to get into into a good college.

Puberty caused a number of pain and suffering for me. I realized I hated the way my body was changing. Thought about diy castrating myself but didn't. Was completely closeted until 20, when I started my transition, after getting stuff set up like transportation, a college job, an internship lines up, etc. Am happier with my body but I still need to get some surgeries. I have bottom surgery scheduled for next summer and not sure when I'm going to schedule an adam's apple reduction, but it's in my plans. I think I'll always hate a lot of stuff about my body even though I'm kinda lucky. Stuff like my proportions, the size of my hands, my voice, some aspects of the structure of my face, etc. These are my purest fucking demons, these things I never had and will never have any control over but tear me apart. Back when I was 16-20, I kinda had very frequent suicidal thoughts but I know that's not the answer

When I was in my last semester, I was so happy. I could always hang out with friends, we'd go out and do stuff in the evenings and weekends. Could do stuff that was spontaneous. A lot of nature, good restaurants, chill people, it was just such a good environment. I wish it didn't all end so fast. 

Since I've moved to where I'm working, my mental health has been kinda going up and down since the breakup, but never really being very good. My baseline mood is depressed. I have 2 friends within half an hour from me. Oftentimes one is too busy to hang out. I'm always the one who initiates hangout plans. My friends rarely check up on me. I'm so alone. A lot of the time I have no one to talk through my plans with other than my therapist. Lately, I've been giving up trying to make friends. Got invited to a few parties several hours away recently, but I'm just too mentally fucked up to go to a party, I'd probably just be stressed out and I don't want to be messing up any vibes. Spiral in anxiety even about small mistakes I make and white lies. I'm such a mess.

I wish I had someone who loved me. Experiencing romance and falling in love with someone only to be smacked with that he had other priorities and didn't think it would work out. And I've talked to him since for a bit, because it was nice to have someone I can just trust and talk with, but when he revealed he threw away polaroids we took and gave away stuffed animals I got him when he moved, it just crushed me. Those things were precious to me. My self esteem was crushed by the breakup and again after that.

Life is just miserable. I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I'm gradually getting my life set up to change jobs to something I'd rather do in a place that will foster better opportunities for a social life, maybe in a year or two. But just pushing through day by day is just soul crusing. I'd bet the amount of tears I've cried this year could be measured in gallons. 

In the last few weeks, I've stopped drinking and kinda went back to that kind of ""clockwork"" mode in my free time- studying, working on personal projects, etc, as I have been meanwhile kinda distancing myself from everyone. The feeling of depression and anxiety hasn't changed. But I guess I'll be making gradual progress. It's just so diffucult to keep trying.",1
How Much Longer?,"I've been tired of living for as long as I can remember, I'm currently 20 and I have a THC card so I can't legally own a gun in California. I've always hated pills but recently my pills are kind of a comfort. Like knowing I have a way out when if I don't have a gun. I promised myself I'd try and wait it out over and over, this is the third time I've given myself a time limit to be happy and I'm fucking tired of it. Once I get a refill of my pills I think I might go for a walk where nobody can find me and just take all the pills, part of me just wants to take the rest of what I have right now but I feel like it wouldn't do anything. I don't think I can wait another year or two just to be even worse. If or when I do it I'm gonna call the few people I know and tell them I love them.",1
How to continue when the one you love leaves,"As the title. Every single day is an exhausting trudge through memories and dreams, promises and wishes for the future. There isnt a single thing I do, or think about doing, that isnt invaded by the desperate pain of feeling and knowing so intensely how much I just want to do those things with her. I cant imagine a single thing I'll ever do again, without wishing she was there too. 

How am I meant to continue like this. It's now been almost three months, and it has been unrelenting. I dont think I've even had a full hour's break this whole time from thinking about her, going back through all of the pain and hurt of the things she did, and the way she tossed me aside, and all the times she promised me she loved me and would never leave. I cant keep doing this. I've twice now attempted suicide, one was the most serious attempt ive ever had which landed me in hospital, and my backup plans go through my mind every night. I dont know what to do. 

I'm 27 years old, and all I think about is her. I miss her with every heartbeat. Has anyone else here ever experienced anything like this? What was your experience? Does it ever go away?",1

I can’t do anything.,I cant do anything today because it’s hurt so much. I couldn’t sleep or anything but I feel tired. My life been treating me like trash.,1
I don't know if I'm depressed or just lazy,"For context, I'm a 16yo male and my family have always called me lazy because I've never felt like doing anything, going anywhere or meeting anyone. I can't find anything to enjoy and often end up doing nothing at all during the weekends and afternoons. At some point, I used to read sci-fi or fantasy, do creative writing and cook in my spare time but it just doesn't hit the same anymore. What's worse is that it's spreading to my homework and studies too, and I'm now facing multiple disciplinary markdowns and detentions. I can't even remember the responsibilities and plans I have until I get called into an office or emailed about it.

Now all my teachers, friends and family think I'm just a disorganised, irresponsible and lazy mess. I feel so worthless as a person and have admittedly self-harmed multiple times. My parents know about this and have suggested therapy but only as a threat; my father in particular views mental illness in a really bad light and often uses it as an insult. They see me cutting myself as a way of attention-seeking, and it's been brought up so many times that I'm beginning to believe them.

Recently I found a new group of friends after reaching my breaking point with the last and shutting them out of my life. They're all geniuses compared to me, two of them getting straight A\*s for every subject in their GCSEs. I haven't talked to anyone for months up until meeting them and I'm constantly so self-aware of how fucking inadequate I am at anything compared to them. I feel so pathetic personality-wise because I'm constantly desperate for compliments but deny any that people give me because I'm this absolute piece of shit that always needs validation but never believes in it, and now all my new friendships feel strained and uncomfortable. I also know that I'm a morally horrible person and I've made so many horrible mistakes in my past (e.g. cutting off all contact from my last friends on a whim and never even looking at them again) and I can't stop thinking and reminding myself about it. I really wish I could change myself as a person and hope that it's all just some mental illness instead of my actual identity. But at the same time it feels extremely wrong to use mental illness as an excuse - just as my father always says.

The only hobby I still somewhat do is writing poetry or sometimes prose, but it's so horrible that I end up feeling worse about myself after writing. I've read the rules so I'm never going to post it either, it's all worthless. My friends tell me that I'm some sort of literature savant but it's really *always just luck*. When I come up with some random epiphany it's because, by sheer coincidence, I read a random bullshit article a week ago that just so happened to be linked to this poem or this extract. In fact, every success I've ever had *is just luck* and I haven't done anything to deserve it all *because I'm lazy*.

The only other things that spark even the slightest interest in me now is random literature, psychology and philosophy, but I'll never be able to study the last one because my family forced me into doing physics, which I despise.

I'm only writing here now because everything, which I've barely even touched on in this bs essay, has kept piling up until now to the point where I have constant lack of sleep and migraines. I'm so desperate to cut myself again because it feels like an addiction; I've only ever felt better after I punish myself - but I'm terrified that it's actually because I enjoy it, the blood and the pain, and only ever do it for attention.

I know I'll probably never get an answer, but I just don't know if I'm depressed or some other mental illness or if I'm really just the lazy, attention-seeking piece of shit everyone thinks and tells me that I am.",1
I think I need more than just talking and an anti-depressant.,"As the title says I do believe I need more than just Zoloft 100mg once or twice a day (depending on my PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression) and a nice chat with both a psychiatrist and therapist. I won't make this post long as I am a bit checked out mentally at the moment. 

We have switched medications, tried meditation, tried more exercise, just baseline things that an outside person could relatively do no problem. Things to boost that serotonin! I have been through a lot with my husband over the last 10 years and it has been wild. Between his dad being murdered in the night by stray bullets, us being homeless twice (way before we had kids) and his hospitalization after he fell from being over exhausted and not sleeping for a good 24 hours. (Head injury with 16 staples in his noggin). 

I can't tell if I want to kill myself and end it all with medications (I'm a Pharmacist) or to just stick it out and be numb for the rest of my life. I feel love towards my boys and husband but I think I have fully given up, I don't see a light and I don't see a way to make things better. I see death as a warm welcome to a tired body and mind.

Dating someone who thinks has depression,"I’ve (29F) been dating my bf (31M) who thinks he has depression.

ISRS subsitution,"Hello everyone. 

Here is my simple problem: I have to stop my paroxetine treatment (20 mg) which is incompatible with a (preventive) treatment I am taking following an operation for kidney cancer. More generally, I can't take any anti-depressants. 

I'm going to stop taking paroxetine gradually over a two-month period.

idk how to love myself,"this time last year i broke things off with a toxic situationship that i let go on for a year. my overthinking and insecurities were eating me alive and i couldn’t believe someone would be capable of actually liking me. but i was wrong he didn’t like me. he said he loved me but he just told me what i wanted to hear so he could get what he wanted from me. i gave him all of me just because i wanted to be loved. i broke myself to mold  into what he wanted but i still wasnt enough for him. i’ve always been the other woman and never the only one. i don’t understand why. i’ve never felt like i belong. i don’t feel like i belong at home after being constantly told throughout my childhood by my parents that they hope my siblings don’t turn out like me and always being told i need to change. i’ve always felt out of place at home. like i’m not meant to be in this family. but this is my family and there’s not much i can do. in school from the age of 5 up until now i’ve always felt like the odd one out. everyone had their groups and i could never find one to fit into. i tried making my own but no one understands me 100%. i feel like the odd one out in every aspect of my life. i feel like the problem child. i feel like the fastest and ugliest person in every room i walk into. i feel like everyone’s staring at me because they can tell i don’t belong and i don’t fit in. at work i don’t fit in. in college i don’t fit in. i feel like i look weird and i act weird. no one wants to genuinely know me. they always want something from me. whether it be answers to homework or for my body, people only come to me to get something. only if it benefits them. i’ve never felt true genuine happiness throughout my life and now in my adult years i feel broken and lost and i don’t know how to fix it. i’ve never felt enough, academically, at home, in friendships, or relationships. over the past year i’ve been again attempting to fit in. when a boy is interested in me and i tell him i’m looking for something serious i get ghosted. why do hurt people hurt people. no one is genuine and everyone is fake. i’ve been following what everyone else does and hook up with people to forget my own pain. i block my pain with sex and drugs and alcohol. younger me would be so disappointed. idk what my purpose in life is. idk why i’m here. i have no purpose and i haven’t achieved anything in the 21 years i’ve been on this earth. why doesn’t my dad like me. my presence irritates his soul. physical affection makes me uncomfortable because it’s foreign to me. i cant say i love you without feeling uncomfortable even though i mean it. why am i like this. i just want to stay in bed forever and never get out. at least when i’m sleeping my thoughts aren’t consuming me and making me so physically sick that i can’t eat and i need to shit all the time because i’m so anxious. why am i anxious. idk. everyday i wake up anxious. why do i seek validation from people that don’t matter. i’m so full of self hatred. i hate myself sm",1

I'm no one's favorite, the one person I had barely acknowledges my existence, and I get it, they're busy.

All I am is an experience. Terrible, experiences, assaulted, abused, hated, failure, and pointless.

Alone every single day and night with no one to turn to. I don’t want to end it but fuck man I need help.,"I’m still making progress in life. I’m living at my parents currently, but i’m pursuing a degree still and have been going to the gym 4x a week for over a year now.

The gym has given me the only confidence I have. I’ve always been skinny so getting in shape was easy, but getting in the gym wasn’t. My best friend in highschool introduced me to the gym and got me into sports. I was in a worse place then. He gave me a friendship and lifelong goals. I always thought he was much cooler than me and much better off, but he killed himself.

I got back into the gym two years after. In those two years I sat in bed every day playing video games and crying. I had and still have recurring nightmares seeing his face is his casket. Stepping foot in that building was one of the hardest things i’ve done.

I this his story is one of the, if not the sole reason I won’t become suicidal. Regardless, i’m still suffering. I’m always alone. I do everything alone. I’m improving in many areas, but I want to be able to grow with someone. I really hope to find love one day. Idk if i’m even deserving of it.

I’ve been smoking weed and taking edibles every night to numb things. Recently it’s just been making me dissociate and forget things. I feel like less of my genuine self every day.

I have one friend who is getting a new friend group now and slowly leaving me. That shit is hard to think about but it’s my reality. Soon i’ll feel more alone than I already am.

The fear of feeling happy.,"The last 20 years of my life has been turbulent and full of trauma. (25F) 
My abusive mother kicked me out after her partner molestered me. I barely know my biological father and the rest of my family are all overseas. So basically I spent many years brainwashing myself that I don’t need anyone, I will be okay just being alone, I have to be extremely independent…etc. Because I know if I don’t be strong enough I will break.

But deep down I know I want to be loved, I just pretend that I don’t.

Last year I met my fiancé, at first I didn’t expect this relationship to last at all since I was convinced that I’m incapable of making someone to love me or even care about me. But it turned out to be alright, for the first time in 20 years I feel that I’m…safe and happy. And I’m terrified of the fact that I’m happy?

A major part of me still believes that my life is supposed to be miserable. I’m so not used to “feeling happy” since feeling depressed is“normal” to me, it was the only feeling I know for many years…Every single day I’m afraid of what might happen that will destroy my life again, every single day I prepare myself for the worst case scenarios that I can imagine. And these thoughts are tearing me apart.
 
I don’t want to go back to my old, sad life, but I also don’t know how to live happily.

If there’s anyone who has been through / struggling similar things…I would be appreciated if you can share with me.",1

The story of a depressive narcissist,"My parents have been fighting for four years now, and they are finally divorcing. My dad is a pathetic delusional narcissist that believes my mother has been cheating on him and dealing coke on his back for years. This is ridiculous, stupid and false, yet it serves him the purpose of being a victim and feeling justified to blame my mother on the fact that she doesn't love him anymore.

On the other hand, she has been stupidly waiting for him to change, not realizing that what my father needed was probably some sort of unconditional love that would help him heal whatever broken ideas he had of himself. Of course, she shouldn't know this. After all, not all of you have grown up to understand what narcissism is from the inside, most of you have just experienced how is it like when the other is the narcissist.

Regardless, it's gotten to a point where every morning when my dad comes from work and my mom goes out to work, they engage in some sort of verbal dispute, mainly because of my father, who will soon have to leave the house, but not yet due to legal reasons.

The thing is, this verbal abuse is not tolerared well by my mother. She says it drains her and yesterday she asked me to tell my father to stop fighting in the mornings. But I really don't want to do it. My father is the type of person to take everything personally, and to whom it is really difficult to talk to. He would probably understand if I told him to stop fighting, but for some reason that's a conversation I don't want to have. I told this to my mother and she obviously told me that I'm a
being selfish and that I should help her. This has put me in a stressful situation.

As you may have guessed, I don't love my parents. Yes, I may be able to see how my mother is probably in the right, while my father is pathetic and stupid, but these are the people who have brought me up to be the shell of a person I am today. The worst thing is that they don't even have done anything to blame them for, they have just never understood who I am.

And who am I today? Just someone whose basically one and only source of pleasure is attention from other people, validation, but who doesn't see value in anything else. Or, if I see value (because I'm not mentally impaired) it's just a distant feeling, not even remotely enough to justify life at all, not even in the present moment. 

And I have been like this for a long time, as far back as I can remember, really. Life's always been like this, even when I was a kid. It's discouraging to try to engage with people my age, becoming part of a friend group, understanding other people, and truly realizing how sick I am, how shallow and crazy what I once believed ""normality"" was.

And what's worse is, this is not like your typical depression or anxiety disorder. I really don't need people to help me. I have never felt justified to be loved or listened to. You feel bad for someone when they truly wanted something but for some reason they don't get it, and they are super sad and you feel sympathy for them. I just didn't want anything to begin with, I'm not even sad, I'm just empty, all the time.

And people who feel and love life hate people like me. You see it all over everywhere. Narcissists are the enemy, you shouldn't be selfish, it's like the most important value of our society. But I don't want to be like this, I just am. It's not something I can stop being. I can't just enjoy life outside of my selfish purposes and focus on that, it isn't that easy, it isn't easy at all. And yet you expect me to behave ethically, just like you, but I can just be that to an extent, and it hurts me that you just can't see it. 

But even if you could see it, what difference would it make? It's not like it would solve much, I'd still be empty, just maybe a little bit less.",1
Cocaine comedowns are the worst I’ve ever been,"TLDR: Cocaine is the worst drug ever and do not touch this shit unless you like being a depressed sack of shit. 

This is probably for a very niche group in this group but obviously my depression led to substances so it’s not that surprising. But anyway to the point, I’ve tried a lot of uppers and one thing people always said was that the comedown was killer, and that you’ve used up your happiness for the week. Yet everytime I’ve had one, the comedown was barely noticeable, it was just back to normal life. I’ve since realized as sad as it was, someone else’s depressed comedown was just my normal life, hate and dread for what I’ve done and for the life I’ve lived.

But, I can gratefully I don’t really belong in this sub anymore cause I’ve really truly recovered. The unfortunate part is I can’t shake the substance use, it’s just part of my life for now.

FINALLY TO THE POINT sorry for a bit of a sob story but I’m currently coming down from a bit of a coke binge and man it’s worse than anything I’ve felt back during my worst. This isn’t my first coke comedown and I’m familiar with the feeling but it doesn’t make it any easier. This shit isn’t even that great of a high and makes me feel like a prick but I always have to eventually excuse myself and just dread everything I did as I finally sober up enough to sleep. First of all it makes me overthink, which just leads to insane panic attacks. It washes me with a sense of dread if I overshared to anyone that was around me while I was high (which I literally 100% of the time did). It’s literally just a feeling of complete shit. Like a said I use a few substances and none of them make me feel this bad, in fact they make me feel so much better than sober which is why I use them, yet coke is the one I cannot fully drop and always leads to the most unenjoyable highs and then comedowns. It’s like the self destructive part of me lives off this shit. Anyway, If anyone else in this sub is depressed and also uses occasionally, do u feel the same that this is worse? 

Completely irrelevant and 1% of y’all will read this but I wanted to post this in r/cocaine to reach the target audience but for some reason I can’t see that sub, so here it is.",1
Help with depression/addiction,"3 years ago I went willingly to rehab. I lost my home, husband, career but when I got out my son chose me.

I stay up all night, sleep all day, have no motivation, watch TV, have no energy to do anything and no friends to do it with. Before now I was happy being single, friendless, career less, living with my parents because I had my son and all his activities and my life revolved around him. I didn’t need anything else.

out of sudden here comes this sadness so strong that i just want to go under my sheets and stay there alone. 
It happens to me so often… I do weekly therapy, take medicine prescribed by a great psychiatrist, I have an amazing family support… I don’t know why I’m still so depressed all the time 😥",1
Lazy lazy lazy,"Do I want to live? I don't know. I still hope that things will get better one day somehow.
Do I want to die? Wouldn't I kill myself already if I did?
I can't go in any direction. I'm stuck and it's getting more and more hopeless every day.
I envy those who are suicidal enough to make the decision. Everything would be so much easier if I was gone. I wouldn't have to do anything anymore ir worry about anything because I'd be gone. 
I'm to lazy for life. I'd rather do nothing than make accomplishments that are important in society and make people have worth. 
If I'm not doing anything meaningful with my life then I shouldn't exist at all.",1
What is one valuable thing you learned from having depression?,"We are all aware how empy and excruciating living with depression can be, regardless of that, what is one positive thing you can share either a lesson, wisdom or breakthrough!

Is it okay for parents to yell at there kid for having a panic attack?,"Yesterday around evening time Outta nowhere I started to feel anxious like I couldn't breathe like I was going to have a panic attack I tried to communicate that to my dad, he got angry really quick saying I was making everyone (my mom and siblings) upset and that I was making a scene and then went off about how Don't have depression or anxiety and instead have a attitudinal problem knowing full well that I have been diagnosed with mdd and gad (major depressive disorder, gentlize anxiety disorder and a panic disorder) after a full blown argument I went to my room to cool off then fell asleep and today when I woke up everyone was mad at me and still are for yesterday. Idk what to do.",1
There are days when I really want to end it,"I honestly don't give one anymore - so I'll leave kind of a memorial here, I guess.

I'm 27 years old. I was SA'd two times in my life, when I was five and when I was 11. Saw my dad give a bruise to my mom's arm at that same age. She got divorced, saw everything. I got rejected by everyone (even someone who used to have intercourse with me, that young) and got bullied 'til university.

Got a degree on journalism after failing law school, and I'm always telling myself it wasn't lost time, but I have to be honest - it was. Worked on a bad job for a while until I got the certificate. Why did I got it? I'm not too sure. Went along with it, with the hopes I'd do something related to communications. I'm overweight, but working on it - I'm not sure why, and doing it doesn't make me feel good anyway.

Got into videogame streaming, then anhedonia came - self sabotage. Ruined it for me with my hoola hoops of thought. Got into videogame analysis and deep criticism - screw it, anhedonia came stronger. I got to even cry with what I made. No satisfaction. Deleted my channel. 1000 subscribers lost. I care about it, until I don't. Got into music exploration - now I get overburdened with the idea of ""the scene"", ""the mainstream"", the following of a broken culture. No satisfaction again. Some things make me escape - wrestling, sometimes miniature painting.

But it comes back, stronger than ever - the reality check. I'm 27. I haven't done anything with my life that's important, and at the zero hour, I wouldn't even care. But it's still affecting me. Now my job is stressing me out - having so many proyects stresses me out - having a reason to exist hurts, but also the lack thereof.

I'm going to therapy since 8 months ago. Found out I'm pretty screwed. Moderate depression, personality tend to go into depressive mode. Passive aggressive, lack of self steem on all fronts, differentiated personality (no idea hows it written on english, I'm latin), functionally bipolar, some hinged level of autism. No self love, still struggling with it. Why bother? Through therapy I discovered I like some pain. It's the only place of comfort I've had for so long, and it's so hard to leave it out. It's almost like this is what I am now, and everytime I get a bit better, I crash harder. Maybe I like it this way.

I have a boyfriend. He does everything for me, for making me happy... but I know he'll never be enough. Because I am not enough for myself, I'm insignificant. I make him suffer so much... Sometimes I told him to leave me - to go out and have a new fresh life, forgetting this sack of nothingness. He deserves better. But he's way too nice. He tries every day... so hard, tries everyday.

Don't even know why I'm writing all this. Maybe this was kind of a rant. Maybe I'll give up soon. I'm not too sure. I've read every single reddit thread about these feelings it seems. Learned so much - even got into Taoism. Nothing seems to work out. Am I wired like this?",1
Need Suggestions ig,"Hi, I am 17, living with my parents, trying to go to college  and get an engineering degree from Australia, but current studies are not going good, I have absolutely distanced my self from all my old friends, idk why, they try to call me, I don't pick up, been months, now i have changed schools, due to some issues, my new friends here are assholes, mostly nagging me or trying to make the most fun of me, I look really weird, I have no hair on my face, nor I can make comebacks on them.

I am just giving up at this point, I can't do anything really except mindless scrolling, I don't talk properly to my father too, he has a really strict attitude, he hasn't ever beaten me or any type of physical pain, but I am scared of him, I want to talk to him sometimes but I just can't, it won't happen even if I try my best, I have no social life either, I don't even have any talents, no skills, just an empty body.

Forgot How to Work,"I've been anxious for my whole life, the consequences of which have made me deeply depressed for many months. I'm on some heavy-duty meds now, which I can feel starting to kick in fully. I would definitely recommend it to anyone suffering.

My true self is awake and it’s going to destroy what’s left. Three days and it’s only getting darker.,"Something happened a few days ago and it’s completely warped me. To use metaphors, there’s always a hole at my centre. I can’t ignore it and frequently gaze into its depths, sometimes climbing in and sulking in its emptiness, but I’m used to it. A few days ago, that changed.

The hole has become me and it’s on fire.

I refuse to elaborate, but something happened to make this change. It’s like scar tissue being scraped away to reveal unhealed wounds gushing and festering. It absolutely will not stop. I can’t hide in my gaming because I shut it off after minutes due to the total absence of enjoyment. I’ve been trying to have some more innocent conversations about other things, both online and in person, but it’s not working. The latter even resulted in someone noting I’m acting like a zombie.

I’m normally an expert at hiding my emotions, especially at work. What’s happened is so powerful that it’s overridden that. A coworker confronted me near the end of the day. He said I looked really sad. The day before that, I was trying hard to hide myself while giving my mother the cookies I baked for her trip. She noticed and I had to get evasive. This isn’t like me. People are seeing the hole and the fire and the emptiness.

I am no stranger to depressive spells. They come, I mask myself, I hide, they pass, I move on. I distract myself with fiction and find an escape. None of that is working and this has been CONSTANT for multiple days.

My heart is stabbing from within, giving me false hope of just succumbing to cardiac arrest and dying already. But nope, it just goes on and on. I’ve had to drug myself to sleep.

Food is empty and my appetite is gone. I’m forcing myself to eat at my usual times for the sake of my weight routine. I put it in me and I’m hyper-aware of its alien presence inside, wishing I could just disembowel myself and fill up the cavity with wires. I wish I could be a machine. Or dead.

My ADHD is firing off the charts, keeping me from mentally focusing on anything I want to focus on. It keeps dragging me back into visceral flashbacks of my worst moments. It scrapes me against these memories and everything I felt as if they were happening again. It analyzes them in eternal split-seconds, reinforcing how worthless and wasted my time has been, reminding me how I should have died 15 years ago.

If only… Instead I’m still here—the same unworthy face preserved in spite of the rot, like the Picture of Dorian Grey.

But I haven’t even touched on the worst part. This is all the cause of something a friend told me—a few minutes and words are all it took to do this. It’s my fault for sharing so much with him… I should’ve expected this. And yet for days I’ve been assaulting him with pure malice, like it’s his fault. I even believe it is his fault, because I’m evil. It finally woke up and made itself known to him. He’s remained silent, ignoring the abuse I’ve hurled. I really should stop… but I can’t resist this urge.

Soon he’ll wise up and dispense with me. It’s long overdue. Inevitable. He’ll be better off and I’ll be left to burn alone. I mean, it’s my damn fault. Let me have what I’ve wrought.

He knows about this account. He might even see this.

Somebody please kill me. I’ve proven I can’t. Not yet. I’m not strong enough.",1
I just cried for the first time in years,"I’m a 19 year old male, I’ve suppressed my emotions for my whole like to “be a man” and it’s to the point where I feel numb, and I have for a while, I just got out of the shower and inside I spent 20 minutes just crying to my thoughts while under hot water, thinking about my failures, things I wish i did and didn’t do, and I don’t know what to feel after because while crying I felt, for the first time in a while, but now I don’t feel, I’m back where I was, I don’t wanna suppress this anymore, I’m tired of trying to be strong for others, crying for the first time in a while felt like a weight of my shoulders yet defeating, like I finally gave up on the mask, how do I by myself, and how do I be strong for myself and not others",1
Military,"Im a 22m and I ruined my life 2 months ago. I lied about my whole life to my girlfriend, friends and family and got exposed as a lying piece of shit I am.

I have no support, no idea how to make friends and the only thing going for me is that I’m relatively fit and in good shape. I think my only chance is joining the military and especially the navy as I grew up around boats. I just don’t see anyway out other then serving and trying to learn a trade or learn personal growth. I know military life can be shit but I have nothing left, no family, no friends, no relationships so I won’t have to worry about any personal Strain it will put on me. I just want to know if anyone else has joined the military as a last resort and how did it go? I just hope I don’t fuck this last option up. I’m just so lost and in so much pain",1
Telling my therapist everything,"(Sorry in advance for any grammatical errors i don’t really care) 
I am finally comfortable enough to tell my therapist the truth about how i really feel. A little context, for the past couple months i have been going to therapy. (i don’t exactly know the specifics it wasn’t really my idea) and during that time i’ve kind of just tried to be the easiest to deal with as possible. Not really going into suicidal ideation, my recent drug abuse, and all that fun stuff. i’ve just been trying to keep things easy and comfortable because it’s very very difficult and uncomfortable for me to talk about it. i have finally decided that i really just can’t keep going like this and something has to be done. so, at my next appointment i am going to tell her as much as i can. i also am going to ask my mom to schedule the follow up with the doctor that i have been delaying and putting off since august. i don’t really know what the point of this post was but ig it just feels nice to tell someone through a screen before i have to do it face to face.",1
An online friend with depression - How do I help?,"I have an online friend where we play together or with our friends but today he told me he's depressed and has been for the last year or so. He no longer enjoys playing or anything really as he quotes. He's also discussed feeling empty or void.

Now what I'm here for is how do I help? I know depression is a sensitive matter and I don't want to do anything rash that might make it worse for him. 
Do I suggest medical help? Or Do I just stand by his side? Give him kind words and validation? Or give him some time and space?
Try and find activities he might still enjoy albeit less enjoyable? Or just being there with him no matter what activity is enough?",1
I’m losing my sense of self,"Delete if not allowed. I’ve been suspecting a depression diagnosis for many years. I’ll be fine for a while, but everytime life starts to spiral again, I go through depressive episodes. I feel such a lack of connection to being my own person, and the skills and hobbies I used to embrace that others liked (painting, theater, writing, games) feel like dead weight to me now. All those sound creative in writing, but I don’t feel like a creative person. I’m trying to make a career change but have no idea what I’d even like doing. I don’t have a lot of opinions to give when people ask for them, and I can feel my physical health declining too. I think I’m slowly losing my sense of identity, and I have no idea (or maybe even no desire) how to bring it back. The thought of going back to how things were when I was ‘better’ actually fills me more with rage than anything, and I truly don’t know why. 
If someone else has gone through this or has any advice on identity, I’d really appreciate it.",1
I need to be anywhere else,"I need to be somewhere peaceful. I need to be somewhere I love. 

I hate this room. I hate my house. I hate where I live.

I need to be on a deserted New England beach on a cold November morning.

I need to be deep within a Pacific Northwest forest at noon, staring up at the bright blue sky behind the canopy of leaves.

I need to be on a cartoonish small Island in the South Pacific with a coconut tree and a flock of seagulls, listening to the soft waves crash ashore.

I need to be on a SoCal beach neighborhood roof in the morning, staring off into the ocean and listening to the soft foot traffic of commuters and children below.

I need to be in a cafe in a small town I’ve lived in my whole life, listening to someone give their order to the barista and taking in the scent of coffee in the air.

I need to be in an abandoned airport in the morning, with nothing but the sound of the forever glowing lights above, and the eerie feeling you get when you’re alone in a large place.

I need to be in my worst nightmare. I need to experience anything other than what I am feeling right now.

I am sad and I don’t believe that will ever change. The mirror disgusts me, and my mind’s perception of myself disgusts me even more. I am nothing.",1
Treatment resistant depression is like being slowly dismantled over time,"Bit by bit.

Pretty much get to watch in horror over the course of decades while every part of my existence is dismantled right before my eyes.

Everything.

The physical, the psychological, the emotional, the spiritual, the sexual, the social.  Bit by bit.  

My physical self is being dismantled and I'm losing vitality. 

My psychological self is being dismantled and I'm losing hope. 

My emotional self is being dismantled and I'm losing  empathy. 

My spiritual self is being dismantled and I'm losing my connection  to the world. 

My sexual self is being dismantled and I'm losing my mojo.

My social self is being dismantled and I'm losing my friends.

It's a slow torture.  And all the while I can see the big world of possibilities right outside my window but I am unable to reach them.  I asked myself everyday why is this happening. I talked to the therapist I read the books I go on the walks I eat the healthy food and still.  No answers. No solutions. Only torment.  I guess the world is just one big ball of pain for some. I want a goddamn refund.",1
I'm Feel So Alone,"All I want is for someone to hold me so I can cry. People think men just want sex, not all of us want to sucked and fucked every day. I broke down at Thanksgiving and my brothers advice was get laid, I know he meant well but I just want to be held. Being alone is what's gonna do it for me, but there is no point for me to try and find something right now because I'm trying to save to move and I don't wanna leave someone high and dry. Even when I move I'm still going to be alone, I honestly don't know if I can take another 2 years of being alone, I'm not trying to exist in pain when that's all I've done my entire life. I wish I would have just stayed dead when my mom had a miscarriage. She doesn't consider me a mistake, she considers me a miracle baby. I tell my mom I'm a mistake because the doctors made the mistake of saving me.",1
Will probably kill myself soon,"My plan since I dropped out of highschool was always to eventually kill myself. I don't enjoy living, only material possessions that bring me fleeting satisfaction.

What do I do?,"Throughout the years I’ve had moments I was a bit down but overall I’ve always been quite a happy person. For year now though I have been slowly doing less and less and don’t feel like I have the will for anything left in me, I have so many things that I liked but when I think about them now I don’t feel anything, nothing slightly excites me anymore. I haven’t been working even though I need too and haven’t been studying either, the only thing I manage to get a bit of will for is meeting my boyfriend but even that is starting to sound like too much work now. I feel like I completely lost myself and I can’t see a way out at all but I also can’t afford a psychologist at the moment. Any advice would be really helpful.",1
Situationship Rejection,"Hi there - wondering if anyone has advice on how to deal with rejection from a situationship? I preface the question with the situationship focus because I think it’s a different type of rejection than one that occurs either post a few dates, when you don’t really know the person, and after a committed relationship has occurred, where someone liked you enough to commit to you in the first place. It’s that weird middle of the ground rejection. 

I was seeing this guy for about 3.5 months, inconsistently. I had a blast when we hung out and he did too it seemed. At the end though, I confronted him about the no labels dynamic and that I wasn’t happy in it and would rather be in a committed relationship and he gave it some thought for about a week because he wasn’t sure and then basically just wanted to end things because “something didn’t feel quite right” and he “didn’t want to force it” even though we “get along so we’ll” which is why he was “trying to make it work”. 

I’m upset about a lot of it, why didn’t he communicate that in any of the previous months if he felt it wasn’t working? Like why did I have to start the convo for him to admit that. I’m not trying to internalize what could be missing in me, but part of me is worried that it’s the sex since I hadn’t really done it before but didn’t tell him that so he probably thinks I’m bad in bed too (even though throughout the whole summer we only hooked up twice at the end, 3 months in, bc I didn’t feel ready to before that), so it seemed like the relationship was more than sex at first. 

There’s also something that stings a little more when you know that someone has found you attractive on the surface but not upon inspection. I haven’t really dated before (24F) and I’ve had many men try and date or hook up with me in the past upon knowing me for a short time. So the fact that I finally let someone in to know me and the first time that I do results in rejection feels very new and hurtful. I don’t know what to do :(",1

Told my brother im depressed,"So I told my brother I’m depressed. He instantly started asking me if I’m okay and why I’m depressed. I dont know why I am depressed, I just feel like shit all the time and dont really wanna do anything. When I told him this he instantly snapped. He started saying I’m not really depressed and that I just think I’m depressed. Is it even worth telling the rest of my family?",1
How do I feel complete and happy,"I want to kill myself. 

This is a burner account because idk what to do. I don’t know how to feel normal. I’ve felt alone my whole life and I felt like I’ve never and will never accomplish anything good. That no matter what all I do is fuck up everything I touch. That I’m too nice and I let people push me around. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m so tired and I just want to stop trying and stop my misery. I’ve thought about killing myself every day for a couple weeks and at one point a year back after the school year ended I was at home by myself and all I could do was sit in my dark room alone. That was the closest I had ever gotten to seriously planning a way to kill myself. 

The only thing that numbs me is pornography and giving myself a little bit of relaxation before it sets back in. But then after I just feel like a worthless piece of shit. I don’t know what to do. The only option I see out is to kill my self. I’ve tried to get help in the past and I guess I have admitted my suicidal thoughts. But nothing is ever taken seriously. Nobody in this work gives a shit about anyone or anything but themselves.

 I don’t know what to do and this is my last hope.",1

No Point In Finding Someone,"People say it's so easy to get laid or find someone but it's really not. It's not easy when you have been taken advantage of so many times by so many people be it emotionally or sexually. People just write off the experiences of men and it hurts, I can't find any form of connection because I feel like I'm just going to be taken advantage of again, whenever I do actually build a relationship I destroy it because I feel like something is going to happen. Whenever I actually take the rare chance and try to talk to a woman face to face they just give me dirty looks and be rude. Nothing works and nothing will ever work, I feel so alone and I always will be alone. All I've ever wanted is to be held but I don't even fucking get that.",1

I’ve tried to block it out, but it’s like it’s a part of me that I can’t get rid of. Idk what to do anymore.

Random Crying Attacks?,"I apologize if my terminology is incorrect, but for the past 4-5 years, I've been encountering bursts of crying. Whether I'm washing dishes, playing video games, working, or hanging out with friends, I might suddenly tear up for 10-20 seconds or shed a few tears. I'm grateful that I can hide / cover these moments in public, as I prefer not to openly express my emotions (please refrain from judgment). However, I've always wondered about the reason behind these occurrences.",1
Skepticism??? Am I fine or should I seek help...,"To anyone who's has been clinically diagnosed with depression/anxiety/BPD or any form of behavioral & psychological disorders, have you at any point experiencd a stage of skepticism?...

Did you ever question whether something was actually wrong or you had unintentionally convinced yourself that you were miserable? Like ""There's no way I'm actually depressed. I haven't had it hard enough"" if you have, what made you question your state of being? 

Some days feel less heavy than others and easier to mask pain and conflict. Some times I can genuinely laugh and smile and feel kind of alright then I'm like maybe it's not that serious then it gets serious again and I'm like well shit...

There's definitely a line where some behaviors and feelings are common and normal. Life is shitty sometimes we all go through things. How do I know for sure that I'm not just creating misery for myself? Some days I feel like I can't escape the struggle then sometimes I feel stupid and like I'm overreacting. Is this normal?

 I know something is wrong but I can't tell if I should just suck it up and do some more internal evaluation and self help or if I should seek professional help and consider psychological evaluation. 

I'm uncertain about reaching out and asking a professional. I don't want to be dismissed or told that my problems aren't severe enough to be issued proper help but nothing else helps and every day feels like it's building up a little more each day. 

I don't want to inflate my balloon of misery if it's not that serious but I don't know. Sorry if this is complicated and all over the place. Trying to be concise and clear at the same time 😭",1

I don’t feel like being strong anymore,"Thanksgiving is over and I’m just tired of hiding my pain and being strong for everyone else. I just needed a day to recollect myself but that’s not an option. I live with my parents (due to medical issues) and they know I have depression but I guess I’ve been so good at hiding it that they forgot. Both of them have had a stomach virus and I’ve done everything I could to take care of them. My dad got over his be my mom, so she’s still sick and I have offered to do anything for her but she won’t let me, just wants to sleep. That’s fine. But I’m now at my limit. I’m tired. I am no longer able to keep up the charade that I’m happy and feeling good. Holidays take a massive toll on me and with my parents being sick, I’m just tired and I’ve stopped hiding it. But my mom asked me earlier, “Where is the good Franny that was taking care of me?”. Needless to say I lost it and broke down. She hasn’t wanted/let me to take care of her. I told her I was tired and left the room. Both of my parents act like they can’t understand why I’m not acting like I was yesterday. There’s a lot more to this story but I’m too tired to go into it all, this was the basis.

I hate the holidays. I’m tired. I wish everyone was well.

I look at people my age and they're all basically in their prime. Meanwhile, I can barely even muster up the motivation to get up and go to the bathroom. If this is what I'm like right now, how tf am I going to function when I'm older?",1
how do people with depression afford to live?,"i’m a 21 year old student living in london. last year i took a break from my studies because of chronic illness and horrible mental health and moved back home (i’m not from england) to stay at my mom’s house for a year while i was supposed to heal and rest. however, no resting happened, because my mom didn’t want me living under her roof without a job, and i also had to get one so i could save up money when i come back to london. so i got a full time job at a bookstore, and spent a whole year just working there, i didn’t have the energy to do anything else after work (no socialising, hobbies, proper meals, anything) and my mental health continued to decline. i spent a month at an outpatient psychiatric hospital program but my home country’s views on mental health are really outdated and i felt like it didn’t help, only made me feel guiltier/more depressed.

the year ended and i went back to uni in london. i didn’t really want to, but i also didn’t want to stay in my home country with toxic family and a super prejudiced society (i’m queer and trans, which is basically a death sentence there) so i had to go back. it was really difficult to find a part time job, and i ended up blowing through all of my savings within a few months, and just barely managed to get a part time job in time to pay rent.

that being said, how the fuck do people with depression afford to live?? i’m a full time student and work part time, and it’s exhausting me to my core. my depression just keeps getting worse every day, and the ONLY reason i still get up is because i’m terrified of being fired, not being able to afford rent and food and failing uni. i don’t remember the last time i talked to a friend or did something nice for myself or even ate a warm meal. it feels like i’m a zombie and i only have just barely enough energy to go to work and to class and then rot for the rest of the days. the thought of living like this for the rest of my life makes me sick to my stomach. i’ve been depressed (along with other issues) since i was 15 and life has just been getting harder and harder every year.

i have been fired from jobs before due to mental health (and chronic illness but that’s a different issue), and i’m terrified that one day i’m going to be too depressed to get up anymore, and then i will lose my education and my job and my shitty london room. what are you supposed to do then? i can’t go back to my family because they don’t understand me and wouldn’t support me, i don’t want to end up on the streets, i have no family or support system in london. i’ve seen people on here talk about not having jobs/degrees, not leaving their houses for months, so how do you afford to survive and have a home, food, etc? sorry if this comes off as mean, i’m genuinely curious because i feel so helpless like i’m barely floating above water and i will drown any second.",1
Deluding myself that things may be okay,"My quality of life hasn’t been high since my son took his own life 6 years ago. I have had my moments where I felt fine, but I have been suffering with  mood swings and they have become too much. Too much has changed and I have lost too much since it happened. 

Recently I sold our lovely old family house. It was in a good location too. I have been in a very bad way since then as I don’t like where I now live. I have been surviving but there have been several attempts to end it all. 

I have retained some hope up to now that things will work out ok once I get over the latest grief of losing my home. Since 2016, I have lost my mum, dad and son, other people, friends, lifestyle, career. Losing my lovely house and my car this year (both are irreplaceable), means that all hope is gone. On top of that, it’s cold and my wife won’t have the heating on. 

It’s time to face up to my reality and I’m going to try to put an end to my consciousness this weekend. I have finally had enough.",1
struggling to leave the house,"it’s been a few weeks since i (18F) finished my last year of school. i haven’t been able to leave my house unless it’s to go to parties or events that i promised to attend prior to school ending. i don’t make new plans for myself. whenever i want to see my boyfriend he comes over to my house, not the other way around. i feel like when i’m not with him, i am just lying around doing nothing with my time. i started working recently and go into an office as part of the job but that isn’t helping my mental state. i am medicated and seeing a therapist which also isn’t overly helping. my therapist mentioned i may need to change meds to find some that work for symptoms of ADHD which apparently i have, but it’s gonna take months until i can see a psychiatrist and my family isn’t keen on helping me out with this even though they say they want to pay for my other medical expenses. my mother can’t even accept that i have autism. i’m unsure what to do from here. ‘you just have to get up and go outside’ is the advice I’ve been given but honestly it’s not helpful. it doesn’t help me. idk. i’m tired and my friends don’t reach out, or respond to me when i ask them if we can hang out. i feel a bit isolated.",1
I keep thinking about my past,"19 year old male here.

I've always been a loser. I've always been the guy that nobody gives a fuck about. I've been bullied and humiliated all through middle school and high school.

Now I'm at college and I thought it was all over. I thought all I had to do was be a new person. But I couldn't. I'm gay and I'm extremely submissive, which I'm not at the moment. I let the married older men do whatever they wanted to me. I let them do non-consensual things to me. They raped me. They treated me like I was a piece of shit. In my high school and middle school life, I let my classmates do whatever they wanted to me. They would hit me and I would do nothing. I just laughed. They were physically abusing me, just like my partners did so. I started taking antipsychotics and antidepressants at the end of high school.

What's my point?

Right now I'm not seeing my abusive partner. At the moment I have no one to bully me. I'm trying to recover, but I can't stop thinking about my past. I have friends who understand me and I love them.

What should I do?",1
Being lonely when surrounded by people,"Just wanted to vent here after spending thanksgiving at my grandparents place. I took a few days off from work to visit, wanted to spend some time before they pass in the coming years.

Little did I know that after not attending thanksgiving for a few years, I was effectively “shunned” by everyone in the family group. Despite trying to talk to everyone, the most I got were one or two word responses and no one frankly cared about my being there.

I’ve literally spent the whole day here on my phone while all the games around me have “just enough people and they don’t want to add one more”. Even though these people are family, I feel like I could fall over dead on the floor and they would just walk over me. 

I would have had a better break if I just bought a Costco chicken and stayed alone in my apartment. Personally, this is just another reminder that I’m not going to find another person to be with and I will be alone. Where can you go if your own family doesn’t want you?",1
Miserable realization,"I thought I was just going through my mid-life crisis, but my feelings of hopelessness and depression have persisted for years now. Feels like my new normal. Im not one to complain without trying to work towards changing things, and I have tried.  Nothing has worked. 

My biggest scapegoat about my feelings is often work/my job. But having some time off around the holidays has given me time to think and reflect. I’ve learned that, while work does add stress to my life, it’s not the reason why I’m so miserable. 

The root cause of my misery is that my life is NOTHING like how I wanted it to be. It’s not like I set some crazy, lofty goals for myself. I just wanted to be a normal person with average/presentable looks, a decent group of friends (quality over quantity), a nice little family, a decent job that pays the bills. Nothing fancy. I have none of these things. Not a single one. How did I get here?  Where did I go wrong?  Why does my every attempt to fix things fizzle out or take me even further away from my hopes and dreams?  

I feel pathetic. I AM pathetic. I will never be able to achieve what pretty much every adult my age does with ease.",1
Feeling worse,"I posted here a while ago on how work really almost threw me into a hole and other things were dragging me down and since then I've lost my job my savings have been dwindling and with my parents on me for rent and a car payment and realizing work was never part of the issue now with no way of going back I've been struggling. I have issues with friends making small comments about me getting help and not just dealing with it
I've tried my whole life to help people and be there for them that this only feels like a hard gut punch. On top of that I don't even know who I am anymore, I've realized that Ive spent my entire life trying to be someone else to fit in and run with a group that the person I once was is almost too far to remember who I was 
I can't feel a thing anymore, I used to day drink to hide it but I can't even do that anymore
I've tried to blow my brains out 4 times now but I've always had a reason not to but now I can't even think of one, but for some reason I still can't pull the damn trigger and now I just beat myself up for being to much of a coward to pull the trigger",1
acknowledging my future,"i have major depressive disorder, but have come a long way. recently is the first time in many many years that i am acknowledging i have a future to live out. it's terrifying! i haven't planned for this! i know i am healing, but it is really really hard.

now for the rant: i have no idea what i want to do with my life. i have so much fear of philosophy and religion. i don't know what i'm going to do after i graduate or for the rest of my life. i kind of just want to travel. maybe i will finish school and work through the summer and after that i can figure it out. but i feel like i should know now. and i don't! i have no idea what i want to do! and for some reason i feel like i should! i want to have a plan, even if life doesn't go according to that plan, i want to know what i am forming my plans around. but i genuinely have no idea. my sense of self is screwed up and i am still actively suicidal. i am struggling to hold relationships with people i'm close to. i am extremely introspective which just drives me further into insecurity and depression. i need guidance but have nobody to go to. 

it is so hard to plan a future that i never thought i'd have. it's like i'm being forced to very suddenly experience the entirety of adulting- other people my age have had years to learn all of this stuff, slowly and over time, but the time they spent learning is a complete blur for me. i now have such a short amount of time until i'm on my own. i don't want to feel bad for myself, but i do feel jealousy towards people who have a more normal timeline for living.",1
I want them to care about me but they don’t,I have two exes that don’t care about me. I text them and they don’t respond back. I say nice things like I hope they have a great thanksgiving and such and such. I put so much effort in making us be on good terms and they don’t care. It makes me feel worthless like my love means nothing because they constantly just throw it away.,1
"What to do now? My impending doom is very close at happening, this is a nightmare!!!","My depression haunts me again, everyday, I can't explain the stup1d mood swing that I am having, I think I am losing my sanity because of school, I am literally shaking with fear rn. and my anxiety is going sky high and the worse part my mind goes blank in the middle of laying out the mag, I only have 5 days just to complete our Thesis magazine, if I fail to show my work on the final defense wtf. should I do then?? I am literally panicking and crying deep inside, is this a joke??",1
What are you actually supposed to get support for?,"Genuine question. I want to reach out to family and friends and tell them how terrible I feel, but what are they supposed to do? Pat me on the back? Tell me that it will pass? 

I am struggling so bad but I'm so self aware that I've already given myself all the advice there is to give. Nothing is getting better. I don't want to be alone but I don't even know what help I need anymore...",1
sick of the lack of focus and motivation,"makes me feel broken, and like there is no hope.",1
I had my first therapy session today and i feel so much worse,"I’ve struggled with my mental health for a long time and have felt suicidal since I was 12/13. Now that i’m 18, and at university I decided that it might be good to get some support. Whilst I do suffer from depressive thoughts, I didn’t think i was that bad. During my appointment, i’ve never felt so judged and validated but in a bad way. I would tell him my habits (e.g., how often i leave my room, hygiene, school attendance) and he would look shocked and disgusted, and that was me making myself look better. I would say how i feel and my thought process behind my feelings (which were often self negating) and he would say i understand why you feel that way. I know it’s their job to make you feel validated and not like a crazy person but i thought cbt also involved disputing those thoughts. Idk i just feel like i don’t understand how this meant to make me feel better. Is this part of the process and is this worth continuing?",1
Accepting I am undesirable and unloveable,"I have physically saved people’s lives before, allowed them to live longer with their family, yet I’m filled with a empty void in my chest that never goes away. Every time I save someone they have the same near death fear face that is universal on everyone and you would think that would haunt but but what haunts me is my inability to express my emotions. It’s so selfish of me for people who have it so much worse than me to complain about feeling lonely but no one truly knows me not even my parents. I’m accepting that my role on this earth was to save people and make the world a better place, maybe in the future people won’t have the same problems as me",1
Help I need someone to talk to,I had bad memories because I'm depressed and now having feelings I have never had before and it scares me ...I really need someone to talk to,1
Can't stop thinking about death,"I'm at a point where I crave death, If I lived in a place where I had easy access to guns like the USA I probably would of killed myself at 14. All I feel is misery and hatred, the thought of having to go on makes me sick to my stomach. I've done extensive research into different methods of suicide and it really seems like without access to a firearm there's no reliable and relatively private methods of suicide I can go with which is infuriating. I used to worry about what happens after death but I've stopped caring, I've accepted that there's most likely nothing and I'm fine with my consciousness simply ceasing to exist. I've tried reaching out for help so many times and each time it was made more and more apparent to me how little I matter to those around me which only reaffirms my want for death. I can't stop fantasizing about suicide and how nice it would be to finally have peace. I spend significantly more time thinking about death then most other important aspects of life such as college and work. I'll have an assignment due in a couple hours that I haven't started and instead of getting that done I'll be in my room zoning out while thinking about how much I despise living.",1
(15M) Am I just really selfish?,"I've been thinking about maybe overdosing next year not to kill myself but just to try and tell people something. I can't tell if I'm suicidal or just trying to get some attention. I've been cutting myself and I'm not sure if that is keeping me somewhat happy or not. I just want to show people I'm not okay, but I think I'm just lying about myself. I just want to be the story of suicidal friend saved by others. why am i like this? I'm too self aware and I'm so confused that that's the only actual reason for me to kill myself.",1
Depression is like a quicksand,"I grew up not knowing anything about mental or emotional health. At first i ignored the signs such as overthinking, trouble getting sleep or oversleeping, getting frustrated at the slightest inconvenience, crying without any reason, isolating myself and other things. And then as time passes by, i became aware of it that I'm showing signs of depression. Like I'm halfway through the quicksand and finding out how to get out of it. But the problem is seeking help to a professional is expensive like I can't even afford to eat three times a day. And right now I'm suffocating. I don't want to do anymore. I keep on fighting but in the end i realize I'm still in the pit  Slowly swallowing me whole. And then this day came, I'm no longer be able to fight because i said to myself I'm tired. I give up. I'm just gonna let this slowly kill me after all, I'm nothing special. No friends to talk to. My parents left me because i was really just a mistake. And my soul is begging me to rest. Then i decided that before this year 2023 ends, I'm gonna end this once and for all. Besides i got nothing to lose.",1
I seriously need a friend,"I have no social life in school and that has driven me crazy. If I have friend I really think that would motivate me to do something. Whether it is studying or playing sports, when I’m doing everything alone at class it’s fucking awkward. My parents tbh are not helpful for me cuz they do not know what I’m studying or planning and don’t even listen to me. I become 17 next year and indeed a person who wants to have any type of normal relationship.",1
Everything feels numb and I’m so sleepy,"I know what’s coming, and every winter I ask myself how many times can I really keep forcing myself through before it gets better or stops? Which one comes first? How much longer am I going to struggle to want to wake up? How long in this economy will I continue to cope before I crack?",1
I just need to vent..and maybe some outside perspective will help,"I can feel myself becoming emotionally numb, loosing my appetite, 7 panic attacks a day…and I’m so self aware most the time that it’s even worse because I blame myself for not changing or doing something different. The house is a mess and I know if I just start with one thing everything else will come so much easier but when I go to do that one thing I stand there full on sobbing…I’ve been exhausted for months so I quit my job and took an easier less paying one at a gas station thinking I needed a “mental load” break even though I couldn’t afford it financially..I wanted it to mentally be worth it so badly. It wasn’t. I’m still exhausted, I worked less. The job was simple and easy, very easy to leave any issues at the door on my way out. But I still couldn’t bring myself to do what I needed to do. All I do is cry and feel exhausted. I think I need a hug and maybe need to find somewhere I can swim or something…",1
