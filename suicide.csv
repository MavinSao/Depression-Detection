"Im probably a pedophile, should i just kill myself?","I havent harmed anyone, and i dont have any photos/videos of children. 

I have had thoughts though and I can feel my eyes linger.

To be clear if i do kill myself its not for any moral act of good. It would 100% be a selfish

My life sucks without the fact im probably a pedophile. 

I have no friends. I am unable to form any social interactions. I am barely able to function as an adult. Im horribly depressed. My life is continually deteriorating.

The pedophile aspect is just an extra ""Is there anything to even salvage here?"". 

I think hey do myself a favour and do the world a favour. End it now while im still a sad tale, then i can like contribute to suicide awareness or someshit.

If i end it later i live a sad life, achieve nothing and people will piss on my grave.",1
i lost the love of my life,"He was my whole entire world. He gave my life meaning and something to look forward to. I was nothing without him, now he's gone and it's all my fault. I will never find another partner. I'm ugly, annoying, stupid, clingy and loud. Nobody would ever find me attractive. Even if I find someone else, I don't want them. I only want him. He was perfect, handsome, funny. I'll never find anyone like him. He made me feel like I belonged, he made me love myself for who I am.

I don't have a reason to keep on going. I have nothing to look forward to in my life. I have no friends but I had him. I'm all alone. I miss the good times we had, I miss his love. I'm not permitted from talking to him or else I can get in serious trouble. Part of me wants to believe that he'll come back to me but I know deep down that he won't. I have no one to go to.

I have nothing to live for. He was my everything. I'm somewhat afraid of death but I cannot live without him.",1
How do people work and still find enjoyment in life?,"     I can’t seem to understand how people cope with having a 9-5 (or worse). I’m required to work a job for at least 8 hours and then somehow I’m supposed to come home and be happy. I don’t understand how people have the energy to be content after a day’s work. It just feels like this sense of impending doom until the next workday. Then somehow I’m expected to work for the rest of my life? I sincerely would rather be dead than have to work, as it brings me too much stress and anxiety. Even if I choose not to work though, I have no purpose in life and I’m a burden on somebody else. Not working makes me feel useless, directionless and depressed and other people probably would view me as lazy and pathetic for not working. It just seems like there’s no winning either way, and I’m definitely forced to work. I just don’t understand how people do it, and I honestly prefer death over this. Does anyone have any advice for me?",1
No women want to date me,No woman has ever liked me. I’m a 23 year old guy & still a virgin. Never had a girlfriend. Never kissed a girl. Never held a woman’s hand. Nothing. Every woman I ask says I look like a shriveled up raisin or that I look like a make a wish kid. I’ve been to rehab 6 times since 2016 for this same reason. Since no women like me then I don’t find happiness or a point in living anymore,1
Please help me i might kill myself,"My parents are constantly being mean to me and I don’t feel wanted in my family. Sure, they sometimes act nice and actually enjoy with me, they spend money on me and spoil me sometimes, but I don’t think they ACTUALLY love me. I’ve been thinking about suicide since I was 10, but it wasn’t serious then. Now it is. No matter what I try to do, my mom and dad yell at me and tell me to fix my  behavior. I can’t do it because there’s something wrong with me( no I’m not special education or autistic or whatever) and I can’t change my behavior. I know that if I kill myself then I will be leaving behind a lot of friends and family and people who actually care about me. My sister is my biggest concern and she is my only reason I still live. I love her so much and I would die if anything happened to her. Should I kill myself or should I talk to my school counselor, who might help but tell my parents? My parents are Indian are “chill” as they call themselves, but my friends are doing a lot of things that I’m not allowed to because of parental restrictions and overprotection. 

What the fuck do I do?
No this was not AI-generated, in case you heartless people were wondering. 
I am a real living human being and I have feelings. 
Sorry for the formatting I am writing on my phone
Btw I am a 12 year old male in USA for anyone else",1
I started cutting myself...,"I don't know what to do now. I'm 24M, whenever I look into the subjects, I'm told cutting is usually done by teenage girls, which makes me feel even worse.

I feel alone, watching as social life flows naturally for almost anyone but myself. Hell, I've tried again and again, but it's always the same : I seem to always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, or people misunderstand everything I say or do.

I feel isolated, no one to talk to or turn to for understanding and support, the bagage is heavy and I fear others seeing it. But what I fear most is their silence, cold and piercing. Therapy didn't work, always back to square one.

I feel that ending it all would free me at least. I don't even expect that to make a positive change for the world, but it would free me at least.

But... I'm too much of a coward to end it, so I take the knife and give a few hits wherever my clothes can cover after.

I'm not even sure why I'm writing here, online.",1
should i just join them,"there’s been like 3 suicides this year at my school and i just feel like maybe now’s my chance to not be considered a “big deal”? like ill just be another one. not the only one. it’s kind of reassuring. idk.

i just feel nothing but loneliness nowadays. my mother is disappointed in me, i have a gambling/spending problem, i barely try in my classes anymore, i get interrupted by my online friends and ignored by my irl friends. 

i think the worst part is that ill always have hope. i’ve always been that way. through everything im always hoping for something. but i want to escape the cycle. i know for the rest of my life it’ll be phases of depression and then phases of happiness. i worry how it ends. i worry ill be in situations that are even harder to escape when im older and in a more stable part of my life.

what then?

everything seems to fall apart. i can’t bear to heal just to lose it all again",1
I hate this life,"I remember my preteens (9-12) being very difficult. I had family problems at home and i was so antisocial that people thought i was autistic, i basically had no friends, i was bullied and it was a tough and lonely journey. I started high school where i lived and started getting made fun of by some girls i didnt even know due to the fact that they were friends with some bullies and enemies i hade .I ended up moving from that place and started somewhere else but i fucked it all up due to my ego and lack of self esteem due to bullying and other stuff. I called a kid with mental issues retarded. I was called retarded mutiple times by “friends” and other people
And i made my whole class hate me. I hate myself almost every single day for that. I never wanted it to be like this i just wanted to be loved.",1
"I'm hiding in the bathroom drying my tears so it doesn't ruin my makeup and I have to get back to work, but I needed to write about how I've been feeling for a long time","I have been repeatedly abused in almost every way. Throughout my childhood I was constantly psychologically tortured but also hit, sexually abused, isolated, overworked. My abuser would find out everything I loved and cared about and threaten to take these away if I didn't do what he wanted, and he would use my disability to torture me even more (autism). So up until 18 I was mostly nonverbal. The abuse was also mostly covert and so insidious that we just fell through the cracks. When I was 18 I became a stripper and ran away from home. I had to sexualize myself for a living before I even learned social skills. Then I started dating someone who seemed okay at first but slowly began to escalate abuse. I broke up with him and right before he left, he raped me and stole all of my savings ($7k) and robbed some of my things. After that things started looking up but then my landlord got sick and I had to move out - my next landlord became obsessed and abusive (going on meth binges until 5am, playing with weapons and staring me down while chatting with me about mundane things, shutting off the electric and wifi for weeks at a time and beginning to install cameras which had me reliving past trauma). I had to spend all of my savings again just getting to a safe place. Now I'm still stripping and so burnt out, these men hurt me in some way nearly every day, I don't make nearly the amount of money I used to due to burnout and the economy. I often go 2-3 weeks at a time with no days off work. I'm struggling just to get by and the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be getting further away each day. I'm trying so hard to get myself together and feel better, but I feel like I'm just going through the motions and dissociated most of the time. I used to be a sober dancer but now I drink or do drugs just to get through the night. I have had healthy relationships since then, and I have lots of things to feel thankful for and things that should fulfill me and I still feel empty and broken. I feel like everyone in my life to some extent has dipped their hand in, taken as much of whatever they needed and then abandoned me. And now that I protect my peace and space people aren't ok with that so I'm just mostly alone and disconnected from everyone and pretend like I can deal with it.

I'm in constant pain and I just want to die. I can't deal with life anymore. It is too much. At one point that I can almost remember, even in the worst times I had hopes and dreams. I wanted to fight for them, be one of the lucky ones that come out stronger from their trauma but I don't have it in me anymore. I'm tired of being told that I'm strong. I never wanted to be strong and I have no more strength left to draw from anymore. The only things that have prevented me from ending it all is that the family that I still have need me, and the fact that my childhood abuser is a horrible person that would likely feel joy and glee at the fact that he traumatized me enough to ruin my life forever, but I still feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable, I just want to feel at peace, I want someone to hold me and tell me that I'm safe now and don't have to worry about anything anymore. I want to go home, but those things just feel like they're meant to be out of reach for me even though other people seem to get them effortlessly.",1
i’m an alcoholic f(27) suicidal- please help me,"
been struggling with my use of alcohol for the past 2-3 years? i went on a break from alcohol for 4 months then recently went out to a club for my birthday and got black out drunk and don’t remember half the night. my boyfriend was there and was told the next day that i was verbally and physically abusive  toward him his friends and my sister. all in which i took accountability for. his friend wrote me back and just said “ok” and it just makes me feel like he doesn’t forgive me. i feel so shameful of what i did and i feel like only punishment and only way to show them that i’m sorry is if i take my life. i have been physically violent with my bf the last time was about 2 years ago when i was drunk. i should say that i don’t think this behavior is random. my boyfriend is verbally abusive in the worst way  when he gets mad at me. we have been making really good progress but now i feel like i set us back tremendously. i have no support. none. i’ live alone. i called Mobile Crisis Support last night and they came today but i missed them. in and out of sleep and took leave from work.  as i reflect on my life i NEVER felt truly loved or supported by anyone and i do have a physical trauma in which my brother tried to kill me by bashing my head with a hammer but i blocked it and hammer hit my elbow causing me to need stitches. my thoughts are going everywhere, i CAN quit drinking. i’ve done it i can do better but i’m afraid i won’t be afforded the chance to redeem myself. i’m afraid if i kill my self i will go to hell. but it seems i’m living in hell anyway. i want help and i am afraid of killing my self but it really does seem that the grass is greener. please respond to me.",1
My mom passed away 4 months ago & suicidal thoughts never leave my mind…..,"I’m a 21F & my mom who I was extremely close to passed away unexpectedly 4 months ago. My mom & I just understood each other more than anyone else & it’s been really hard for me not to have my mom around anymore when I need advice or just someone to talk with. 
Before my mom passed, my family including my grandma, aunt, my mom, & I all lived with each other but I’m not close with my grandma & aunt like I was with my mom. I’m just super stressed trying to navigate this world on my own without my mom’s advice. It also stresses me out knowing all my family members are aging & after they pass I don’t know what my life will be like without them here. Tbh I’m scared of suicide but I’m always having suicidal thoughts constantly especially when I think about my situation.",1

Everyone says the path to success is never straight up or some bullshit, but I have done nothing but go down for more than a year and a half trying to transition, develop my social skills,dealing with adhd, and unpack mountains of childhood trauma isn’t helping, I thought going to job corps would help get me out of the environment that was bringing me down, and get out of the cycle of self harm but all its done is get worse, im only a month in and I just can’t come to terms with this being my life for the next two years. I know if I leave I will kill myself this is my only chance to get the education necessary for a decent job, but I can’t do it anymore every thing that would be a trivial problem on its own has come together to make my life a living hell the stress the anxiety the paranoia everything, I just can’t do it. If I leave here I will have the funds to carry out the plan to end my life I try to think about the future and what it would mean to die with so much ahead of me but I just don’t know what to do.",1
Anything to do in life?,"For me. Im sure you find lots of things fun.

- wake up tired anyway

- school

- go home

- take a long nap and neglect my work

- go back to top

I cant socialize at all. I looked up all those techniques serial killers use to seem normal (before some bitchass says that's psycho, ted bundy got away with it for a long time). Except it didnt work for me. I literally cant be normal or fake being normal. I'm worse than an actual serial killer.

Nothing is fun at all. There is nothing worth waiting for and considering the overwhelming amount of ""life gets harder from here"" and ""youre on your own now"" it does not get better.

Also the previous dickhead didnt answer my question: most painless death i can do with household stuff???",1
Barley living it seems...,"

19F here with narc (or possibly bpd) mom. 

Growing up, my mom has always been angry and bitter. She has abused me physically, mentally, and verbally all while my dad sat and enabled her behavior. 

She never has anything positive to say and is always raging in the house. Over the years she has picked me apart almost. Hanging my insecurities over my head and making me feel worthless as a human. As of today, I just hate myself entirely and ashamed to even exist.

Last year I attempted twice and once this year. I just can't take it anymore in this house. I sometimes use alcohol or sleeping pills so I can just pass out and escape whenever she gets in a rage.

Recently I found myself not caring about my mother. I used to care, and try to please her, but now I don't. I've turned angry and bitter towards her. If she argues with me, I argue back. I tell her how I feel. However of course I can't say everything I want to tell her or she'll kick me out (as she has threatened many times).

I'm currently in therapy. Been diagnosed with so much. Bpd, bipolar, GAD, and anorexia. My therapist believes that I inherited bpd from my mother (possibly she has it) and it scares me. Because I'm so afraid of turning out like my mother. I attend dbt and try to get better. I don't rage like my mother. She takes everything out on others, I take things out with myself. 

My therapist says that I'll never fully heal while I'm living in that household. I'm trying to move out, but I'm having financial issues. I start University in January, but housing in that town is expensive.

So I'm stuck. I hate to admit this, but sometimes I wish my mom would just pass away. Nothing tragic, just maybe in her sleep peacefully or something. 

I just hate going home everyday and seeing her. I hate my dad's lame excuses and how he defends her knowing very well she abuses him too. Back when I was 12, my mom threw me up against the wall and started strangling me. My dad ran over to get her off of me, but that was it. He just said to let it slide and act like it didn't happen. 



[TLDR; Narc mom abuses and tears me down everyday. Dad enablers her behavior. Close to ending my life.]",1

I want to donate my organs,"I don't enjoy living, I feel like a waste of space, today I wanted to at least donate blood but I couldn't because i'm taking antidepressants that aren't even working on me anymore. I want someone to give good use of my organs, I want to give away my heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, skin, and so on. A part of me can still live in another person's body, maybe at least I would finally be of good use. I wish I could just go to a hospital and say ""Hey I don't want to live anymore so I will donate my organs and blood"" but i'm just wasting away.",1
Everything and nothing is stopping me.,"I don’t see any point of being here.
I’ve given everyone every last piece of me and I really can’t do this anymore.
I tried so fucking hard to be everything that my parents wanted me to be but nothing I could ever do would be good enough because my own parents don’t want me.
My mom told me that it was my fault that I was raped because I ‘wasn’t being an adult’
She told me that she regretted putting me in therapy when I admitted it was helping me not feel so suicidal all the time.
She went out of her way to harm me any chance she was given.
My dad doesn’t want to know what she said and he demands that I fix it because his peace of mind is more important than supporting his son.
My siblings all hate me because I had to step up and act like a parent because our parents could not.
My siblings hate me for a role I was put into and they constantly use it as a way to say that I was ‘treated better’ because I had more independence or trust. 
Why on Earth does a SIX YEAR OLD need to be trusted to care of FOUR YOUNGER CHILDREN???
I did the cooking, the cleaning, kept house, by the time I was SIX. 
My grandmother taught me ‘to be a strong woman’ and to ‘take care of the family’ because she couldn’t save her daughter, my mother, from her drug addiction. 
My mother was a narcissist meth addict up until I was 14 years old and my father was strictly a ‘provider’ and either worked excessively or came home to beat us for whatever reason he deemed deserving of that day.
I was beaten for smiling, for laughing, for crying, for arguing, for ANYTHING.
I do not have reactions like my ‘normal’ peers.
I don’t emote. 
If something is funny I say ‘that’s funny’ or ‘that’s hilarious’ with a dead pan expression. 
If I am sad I do not cry, I want to but I physically can’t.
I am unable to do any of those things even in my completely safe spaces. 
As I’m writing all of this I’m dry eyed but I’m sobbing desperately on the inside because I desperately want someone to SEE me. 
I want someone to think I matter.
I want someone to help me. 
I am physically different than my peers.
I am psychologically different from my peers.
I have had therapists listen to my story, my trauma, and ask me ‘How are you still even here?’ or ‘I wouldn’t have blamed you if you had killed yourself’
I don’t have a fully thought out answer to that question to be honest but I have a few mini partial answers.
I’m always here for somebody else.
Right now my only reasons for trying are my girlfriend and our cat and it getting harder to do it for them even.
I don’t see a point to do it for me but I can try to keep doing it for them I guess until I either fail and kill myself or get better.",1
My life is going nowhere,"In limbo here. My life is going nowhere.

Today I woke up at 8:13 AM. I’m supposed to be at work at 8. So yeah I emailed them I was sick. I have no social life or anything so I had nothing to do all day. Texted my sibling and they left me on read. I have no friends or partner. Everything is just meaningless. I don’t have MDD I just feel like shit about my life. For the past year or two I’ve been on and off r/suicidewatch. Lately it’s been getting more serious. I regularly have fantasies about doing it and listen to music which gets me in the mood, as fucked up as that sounds.

Again I don’t have MDD or any “severe” mental illness. It’s just my life is pointless. I don’t know what the alternative to committing suicide is. I guess just keep plodding along.

Everyone tells you to get help, however when you finally do manage to get help they gaslight you. And give you stupid advice like take walks. I take walks literally every day especially since I have a dog to take out. And guess what? I’m still suicidal. Like I just can’t deal with the useless advice and invalidation. Whenever I try to focus on reality for 5 seconds and engage with doing something I just get depressed and shut down. It feels like minor inconveniences are torture and my life is torture. Every minute is like being trapped. There’s just no point in anything. I don’t want to die really but my life is going nowhere. It doesn’t matter where I go I still hate myself and am ugly.

Also “reach out to people” is an absolute joke. People leave you on read.",1

My parents will marry me(15F) off soon because of my bad grades. I will kill myself before they can do it.,"Marriage involves sex and pregnancy. I have a huge fear of sex with someone I'm unattracted to, and pregnancy. I'm a antinatalist actually. I also have MDd, Social Anxiety Disorder, PMDD and I think dysthymia too (Not sure if it can be comorbid with MDD).



I study several hours a day but fail to get good grades. I only get average or straight-up fail. I'm bad at memorizing anything. I can understand very fast but unable to retain it.




My parents told me they are looking for a husband for me because I'm not cut out for studying. I come from a third world Muslim country where child marriage is legal. I'd rather die then end up as a poor person so I decided that I won't go to one of those places that help child brides.





I don't want to seek asylum because it means going to another country. I can't afford international plane ticket, I only have $40 in savings. I need to apply for visa as well. One way I could do is by going in a ship but I'll get raped and it costs like $1000+. I also don't want to go to a country where I have to learn a new language. Dying is easier





Escaping to a English country means I'll be seen as a terrorist, bomber, sand n***er, paki, etc. I don't want to deal with racism. I'm not even Muslim





I'm not dying alone, I won't let them boss me around so easily. I'll fight my future husband so he knows what abuse he'll regularly face if he marries me.",1

I think a big reason to make a decision like this is just a blatant disregard for myself and others, that and overall poor quality of life. If the quality is low enough you can reach a certain point where nothing is valuable to you. Your view is shaped by your environment. My environment has always been below the average for a regular person, especially for a first world country. It's not changing anytime soon and it's out of my control, the only thing I *would* be able to even remotely control would be; death. And if that what it takes to stop then why wouldn't I? I have every reason in the world to not continue, it is so unbelievably ironic how much the bad outweighs the good. Genuinely, how could you ever help someone like that?

She’s only 12 and I’m so scared that I never tried hard enough to be there for her. I don’t know how to help her. I don’t want to make my parents take extreme measures but it’s so serious. I’m already seeing the signs. She’s already starting to distance herself like the notes said she would. She said she would pretend to take her medication but hide it away so she can overdose on the date she picked. The date is in early January. I really need to help her and I don’t know how. I just told my mom to keep her medication locked up. I don’t know if my mom can afford to quit her job to be there for my sister and pay bills. This is weighing on me so heavily. I’m an adult and work full time hours while going to school and I don’t have time to be there for her. In a way I feel like I pushed her away so many times and it’s my fault she feels this way.,1
"Just got out of hospital, already planning to try again. A vent.","Title, basically. 

I just got out of a stint in the nuthouse following a suicide attempt. It’s my first night back, lying in my own bed, and all I can think about is how I’ll end my life properly. I think I’ve formulated the perfect plan, I just need to choose a date. 

But I’m conflicted. Slightly. I’ve been given resources that I could potentially follow up on, continue treatment, chase that possibility of recovery. There’s a part of me that wants to get better. Ride the waves, see the good and the bad, take the meds, go to therapy, learn to live. Survival instinct is a powerful thing. Yet, I’m more afraid of living than dying. I’m not sure that even makes sense outside my head. 

The years have taken their toll. Maybe it does get better, but I’m not sure I want to. When I think about going to the appointment they set up for me, I want to vomit from the anxiety. 

I want this to be over. I want everything to stop. I long for that eternal rest. And strangely, now that this feels more like a choice and less like fate, I’m more at ease about making that choice.",1
Feelings of self harm / suicide,"Where I am right now its like 4:30 am and I cannot sleep. Ive been going through a lot of trauma in my childhood from being badly abused by my brother to having neglectful somewhat sociopathic parents. Im engaged and want to move together with my fianccee soon but since Im autistic and have adhd i always fuck shit up and get my partner mad. I feel like I dont belong into this world, where my fiancee lives maybe more but even then and there i felt unhappy. All therapists told me in the past that i should just go gain some self confidence via boxing or meeting people but its insanely hard for me to go outside.

I feel so tired. I work in a middle management position in a German company but can barely get by. I work my ass off but feel like everyone dislikes me for who I am or doesnt listen to me. 

Im also trans and feel like nobody acknowledges that. My name is legally changed but yet I keep being told to wait longer for my documents being changed. I couldn’t wait for bureaucracy with my hrt and bottom surgery cause it was driving me insane. 

Im just generally so tired of the exploitation, the stress of society, the stress of not knowing how to interact with others or if i fucked up.

I feel like just seeing myself bleed and harming myself so bad. The only thing holding me back right now is my tattoos…",1
I'm going to kill myself,i fucking hate all my friends i hate myself i hate my family i hate everything. everyone's a fucking lier for saying they'll always be there for me but look at them now. they don't fucking care for me and i'll just die alone with no one to care for me.,1
Futile life,"My life is futile. I'm certain nothing good and useful will ever come out of me; because even if people describe me as a smart person with many skills, I also can't apply them in the real world. I may be smart but I'm weak and fragile out in the real world. 

I'm just too tired of psychological and psychiatric treatment. I've decided I will cease all mental health  treatment and just kill myself soon (<6 months). I'm tired of depression, anxiety, paranoia, voices and creatures, feeling disconnected from reality, sensory problems. I'm tired of my mood swings, not being able to have stable relationships (non sexual or romantic, just relationships with anyone), feeling like everyone is judging me and wanting to hurt me, fucking gender dysphoria.

There's no point in continuing as I see it. If every future I can imagine is full of pain and misery, why even try? Is it worse for myself to keep living miserably or to just end it all? I think the answer is that it's worse to keep living. The voices in my head know this full well, and always have, I was just unable to see it. But now, I see it and recognise it. There's no other way out.

As for actually doing it - I am planning on either jumping somewhere high or drinking methanol in quantities high enough to be fatal. I've tried six times already with meds and trying to hang myself without success, but I'm going to make it sure the 7th is the successful one. I like the number 7, so it must be really fitting.

I'm going to do it. I'm going to die by suicide. I'm going to comply with these voices that always knew what was best for me, I'm going to end my futile life and my hopeless future. ",1
"Well, today might be it","I kept crying and crying and crying today. Last 2 hours. My head hurts. I might do it. OD? Crash? Idk. 

Ever since I moved to college I was happy. I didn’t tell my family or therapist this but I secretly am happy I got to go to college. Thanks never needed to “go”, nobody would be there to distract me. Nobody getting in my way.



Edit: I’ve been clean from cutting but I might start today. 

I met this girl a few days ago and I absolutly love her. She takes such good care of me but I’m worried I’m gonna ruin it. I always ruin things. Should I do it before she gets too attached? 
I always can tell when people change in convos as I’m super observant. I notice their mood changes and how they text. I’m scared she’s gonna leave me. I’d rather get it over with first 

Edit 2/update 
Well she texted me. She got mad at me because I got so attached so quickly even though I can’t help it. She has a busy day. I guess it and I knew it. No matter what people say don’t fucking trust them. They don’t know themselves. They say you will never get annoying but when the day comes. That changes. I can’t take it anymore ",1
One Month Left," I either make it or break it from here. Got a promotion at my job (good news for family they are happy), all debts paid, 10 grand in savings, 20 in the 401k, and lastly, another 7000 in my trading account. From my first post I had 2000 in that account so it’s nice to see the growth and I’m getting good returns weekly. 

I said before if I don’t figure something out which is either financial freedom or a purpose in life, then I will be killing myself the night of the new year. Still no purpose in life yet that I am happy about at all. Everyday the negative thoughts of suicide creep into my mind, some days the feeling is heavier than others. I stopped punching myself though, feeling good about that since I was good for a couple years not doing so. It’s a terrible insane coping mechanism that spiraled from my cutting addictions back in middle school, high school and college and I hate it.


The trading is helping me feel better at times too, it’s nice talking with others about stocks we’re interested in and what plays were making, poking fun at each other for mistakes, reminders of risk management everywhere. So with all that, when I do end up leaving; At least I’ll leave my family with some cash, the best their worthless, piece of shit, no good for nothing son could do.

And listen I know no one gives a shit about this but I have no friends and nobody I would ever tell these things to. So thanks anyway.",1
Holiday blues,"My sig other wanted me to go to holiday with his family and I felt too depressed/scared to go, but too afraid to stay home alone. It seems too difficult to do the social things I used to. There’s no reserves and patience anymore. Every time I try to be social, I’m rejected. I don’t blame anyone. It’s just gotten too difficult to navigate. It seems I don’t say anything right and conversations are challenging to keep up with. 

Gut told me to sit this one out. I didn’t listen and sure enough, my inability to say no and need to people please ended up causing more damage to my relationship. 

It’s no use trying to explain, no one cares or gets it. No one wants to hear it because they have their own problems. Mental health is still stigmatized that telling anyone anything almost always results in more trouble and confusion. 

There’s never been a point in my life until recently where I’ve said to my self, “I should go do this thing I hate so I don’t off myself because I’ll be alone.” 

Thanks for reading this. The last few years have been especially rough and I know I’m depressed. I have alcohol issues and psychiatrists have been weird about prescribing pills. I have an alcohol problem not a pill problem. 

Something for social anxiety would help me not drink to feel comfortable. I know I self medicate. Not sure what this post is about. Just a rant I guess. I’ve been through a lot and my patience is done. No one cares. No one hears me. I feel like I’m speaking a different language most of the time. It all seems to difficult these days. 

Thanks Reddit. Please don’t r/thanksimcured me. Almost had electroshock for treatment resistant depression and I’ve been through the wringer and around the block. Just needed to vent. Love you fucks.",1

I dislike being female. Should I kill myself because of it?,"I don't have gender dysphoria. I simply believe that life is not worth living as a woman. I think life is meaningless in general but even more so as a female. Males don't get to deal with menstruation or pregnancy. They're more stronger. Men are more grounded than women because they are more physically able. Women are kind of disabled. At least for me and I'm one of the more lucky ones.




I was born to travel the world and walk the streets at night alone; I can do neither. I'd just kill a man that harasses me, but that leads to imprisonment. I don't feel guilt or empathy, I don't know if I have Antisocial Personality Disorder or something, but that's why I wouldn't care about killing someone.





I'm just tired of all the misogyny. I would lie about having gender dysphoria and transition to a man, but I'm afraid that real gender dysphoria will be too intense. I'm also afraid of seeing my body change.



I'm very lonely in general. No one likes me. I think people know that I don't care about anyone. I feel indifference to even my family. It's hard for me to care for anyone when they abandon and harass me






I'm a teenager by the way. Just tired of existence. To exist is to be bored. Maybe I could run off and become a terrorist but I'm a woman. I can't participate in the revolution or the wars because I'll get raped. Life really is pointless. The meaning of life is to suffer.",1
I know why I'm suicidal but I can't do anything to change it,"Hi there,

I've always had a bad relationship with my mental health but recently I've been feeling completely detached from normal society. I'm a college graduate who's been out of school for about two years and I'm still living with my parents in the suburbs. I don't have friends and I don't have a good relationship with my family. I often daydream about the life I could be having if I was living on my own in a city, where I have autonomy to go out by myself and walk to places and talk to strangers in bookstores and coffee shops, and I feel like dying when I crash back down to reality and see that I'm still living with my parents with no prospects of moving on my own soon.

2-3 years of my college life was taken to covid so I wasn't able to get internships or network with others, so I haven't been able to get a job at all. After graduating I was unemployed for 4 months, worked a retail job for about a year before quitting, was unemployed for another 4 months, and the job I have now is even worse than my old retail job. I'm overworked, not paid a living wage, and my managers won't accommodate me (I asked my manager if I could reduce my hours from 5 days a week to 4 days a week because I was starting to feel burned out, she rejected it and said that if I was burned out after 2-3 months of starting this job then I should reconsider my career choice. I was really angry after that meeting).

So I don't have a solid income stream. So many recent graduates I've been talking to are saying the same thing, that the job market isn't hiring and a large number of college educated people who paid full tuition are ending up unemployed—and a lot of those people would be much more qualified for those jobs that I would ever be. I've been job searching for so long, both jobs in and out of my major, and I can't find anyone who wants to hire me, who will pay enough to at least cover rent/expenses, and that won't make me have meltdowns every day (I'm autistic and have bad anxiety). I see a lot of job openings for sales people and delivery drivers—trying to coerce people into buying expensive products doesn't sit right with me and driving makes me anxious. I guess that I need to lower my standards or accept lower paying positions, but neither of those options feel good to me.

On top of this, I don't really have any friends or anyone to talk to about this. The only local friends I had have all moved to the city or to different states. I only have two people from college who I talk to regularly, and even there I'm estranged from them since my college is hundreds of miles away. I've tried making friends online but it's exhausting trying to advertise my personality to others by replying to posts or inserting myself in public discord conversations like a squeaky wheel. I also have anxiety talking to strangers because I don't know if they'll be people I can trust when talking about my depression, autism, what have you. I feel bad for the one online friend group that's stayed with me throughout the years because lately I feel like I've been so constantly depressed and I really hate that I bring down the conversation every odd number of weeks when I reach out to them because I have no other people to talk to about this stuff.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't make friends where I live now because the only places near me are shopping centers and highways. I can't move out to a city where I can easily meet new people because I don't have the income. I can't get a job because the market is terrible. I feel trapped and stupid for feeling trapped because I know the solution to stop feeling like I want to die but nothing I've tried up to this point is working.

I don't know, a part of me is also scared that I'm wrong. What if I somehow get a job and I end up living in the city and I still feel like dying? What if I'm never able to make new friends and I end up alone again? I'm so, so, so exhausted of feeling like this.",1
Thinking of everything that was left unsaid...,"As I sit here on my little sofa that's also my bed, my mind going a mile a minute with thoughts of things I wish the world could hear me scream before I end my life, I wonder how many people already left us with so much they did not say or do.

Recent DID diagnosis - trying to cling onto life please help me anybody,"I tried to explain my life situation and my current agony but the words just aren't coming out. 

Long story short, I was recently diagnosed with DID. This onset due to bad childhood stuff. I feel like a monster, a sinking ship. My symptoms blew up after my engagement and my fiance and I have been trying to navigate it since. I don't know whats wrong with me. He's literally an angel on this earth - he is the most beautiful and incredible person. And, I think part of my mind thinks I'm going to drag him down or hurt him or hurt the future children we wanted to have. 

Child-bearing? Forget that now. Suddenly I'm so disgusted and horrified by my body (despite being very conventionally attractive) I don't even recognize myself or my body parts in the mirror. I was over a year clean from self harm, and today I relapsed. My Fiance is devastated and horrified by my relapse. He keeps insisting that he loves me, and this is his choice, and that he wants no one else in his life, and I am his everything. 

Why? Why me? The freak? The monster? Part of me doesn't even care if I'm damned to hell anymore - part of me feels like this was my fate. Set up for failure at such a young age by a horrifying trauma and parents who didn't know how to handle me and left me to be independent because my siblings demanded more attention (understandably - since 2 of them have disabilities). My family thinks I'm successful and doing great - when in reality I'm struggling to live to the next day. I have 100k in student loans - getting married to my fiance is going to increase our payments and I'm going to continue to drag him down. 

I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like my mind is being pulled in a thousand directions. He doesn't deserve this - why is he staying? Part of me wishes he would just break up with me so I can die and never hurt him or drag him down again. I just started with a new therapist (who's very good) - I'm trying I swear... 

Please - someone - anyone help me. I want this nightmare to be over. I don't understand what I have become - my trauma has tainted my entire life. ",1

suicide,"I'm hurting so fucking much I cant tell when I'm okay I want to die so fucking much I have been researching easy ways I contemplated how where when I've been looking into assisted suicide and think it might be a option but sometimes I just feel like I'm being dramatic but I'm so fucking gone I only feel ok when I'm drugged or drunk even then I feel like I'm just using it as a way to get closer to death

Horrible human. I treat others horribly,"Prefacing this with I struggle with emotional issues before my period. 

I thought today we could have a fun day after work my husband and I. I said let’s get candy and have a movie night. I was so excited. I asked if we could put up the Christmas tree. 

So I go walk the dog I never wanted. While he was supposed to do pile of dishes he left last night (I had already picked up a bunch he left before) and put up the tree. 

I get home from the walk and he’s talking to his mom nothing is done except the tree. (It’s 5:35pm at this point)

His mom says they’re coming my birthday weekend (2nd year in a row. His mom said bad things to me in 2020 and apologized a year later in a letter. Still pretty sure she hates me)

I get upset that he agrees to go out with them. And leave me at home alone?

Then I do realize I was dumb. He doesn’t see his parents because they’re out of state. So I go apologize. 

Weird I know but He starts playing with me like slapping my butt I try to slap him back but he has my arms tight. He then pinches my nipples. Tell him to stop. I try to do it back. Can’t. My hands are held tight. 

Walk away tell him let’s clean up this mess you left you should’ve done it while I was on the walk. I’m complaining and he starts making obnoxious sounds like the purge alarm over me. I get annoyed and throw something small at him to stop (bad I know) he throws it back harder and says equal rights. 

Then he’s holding my arms back and I just stick my tongue out to spit at him he says that’s the final straw. Says I’m a spoiled b-word and that I’m horrible and ruined the night. He refuses to speak to me. I get upset and annoyed (again I know I’m horrible dog lovers don’t come at me) so I grab dog and put her in a closet she scurried away then try to scare her with a decor she doesn’t like. He then pushes me multiple times will walking towards me saying “how do you like that? Don’t touch my dog ever. “ 

I come sit in the dark closet. Been crying, I hate myself, I’m starving. 
What hurts most is I’ve been laying here for an hour or more and he hasn’t even come by. He hates me. 

I wish I was d3ad, I don’t deserve anything in the world. I should be alone and sad forever. Im a horrible human being.

I'm so tired and so sick of living this way. I want to be protected and loved and feel something nice for once. I'm sick of pretending to feel or trying to force myself to be happy. this is so fucking stupid",1
I wish i never existed,"I was always lonely. In school during each stage of it, I was being made fun of. I never had a true friend I could talk to. I was never in a relationship. I was born poor. I always saw what other people had: vacation, money, great houses, electronics, relationships, friends etc. Even though through my hard work I earned a lot of money - I will always be behind the people that had it in the beginning. I will never be able to buy memories they had. Yes I am jelous, and so what? 

My parents should have never had a child. They didn't have anything. What could they teach me? Nothing. They didn't know anything. 

I wish I just never existed. Life is a hell. I don't know how my heart can bear so much pain during the 27 years. I don't remember being happy. I am always afraid of the future. 20 years ago I had a serious car accident. I wish I died that night, but I didn't. 

I wish I could just leave, but I can't. I am too afraid.",1
Need crisis advice - please help,"I guess this is a throwaway thing but crisis lines never work and I don't like burdening my friends or family with my stuff anymore.

I am severely suicidal - have been for years.  I've been in hospital twice from previous attempts. At the moment the thoughts are overwhelming and I've written up plans on how I'd do it and what notes I'd leave behind. 

I need a good reason to not do it. I have my boyfriend and my cat who I both love but the overwhelming dread and fear that my friends hate me and I have no one who genuinely cares about me is so much. My mother has given up on me and has chosen her boyfriend who abused me over me and my sister. Losing her makes me want to die.

All I want is to genuinely feel loved and cared for. Not as an obligation or people fearing that I'll do something but because they actually care about me. I would appreciate kind comments or support or genuine advice, thank you",1
I plan to kill myself on Christmas day,"I plan on hanging myself on Christmas day. I will wake up, eat my breakfast and then I will hang myself. I will not leave a note. I will make no phone calls. I will be alone and I will be alone. I will die, alone. I will not speak to anyone and I will reach out to nobody. This is my plan",1

Is the only option to die if I don’t want to work?,I don’t want to go to any more job interviews because it has only given me trauma. I don’t want to work. I didn’t ask to be born. I didn’t ask to be born into a poor family.,1
I am going to kill myself before I turn 20 in two weeks.,"This is not an impulsive decision. I have been struggling on and off with depression and extremely severe anxiety since I was 12. That’s almost 8 years. I tried therapy back when I had insurance but it wasn’t a good fit. I don’t have insurance anymore so therapy and medication are off the table. When I was 12, I told myself that things would be better by 16. When I was 16, I told myself that things would be better by 18. When I was 18, I told myself that things would get better by 20. Nothing ever got better. In fact, I’d say that things got comparatively worse because life got harder and I don’t have the tools to deal with it. College is impossible for me for some reason and everyone in my family thinks I’m crazy, lazy, and irresponsible because of my inability to do well. I am tired of always been behind and never understanding how other people are able to do things so well. I feel so behind maturity and career development wise that I can’t even see a world where I could ever get caught up. Maybe I am or maybe it’s whatever undiagnosed chronic health condition I have but it doesn’t matter because I can’t do this anymore. I can’t keep failing. I can’t keep living till the next happy moment only for it to fade away so quickly. I can’t keep doing things wrong and making mistakes. I haven’t made any meaningful contribution to this world and I never will be able to because the world wasn’t build for slow thinkers like me. Sure my mom will be devastated but that doesn’t out weigh the great use that will come from my organs when I die and donate them. This is the only way I can have a positive impact and make some sort of good in the world. When they ask why I did it, the answer will be easy. I was tired of not knowing what was wrong with me, and not knowing how to fix me.",1

I feel alone…,Being alone is the greatest thing ever! Said no one ever I have been alone for nearly 5 months and now coming up near the 5 moth mark I hate being here. I had it all freedom and money! In all reality am I the one who can’t be the victim? I go about trying to get things set to make my life better then my family took away the car. I ask why I don’t have access to my money and they say I always buy things every month. And then I ask why I can’t drive and they say all I do is go am I the cause of the pain? Or is my family? God i want to die!!!,1
My story,This is true story that happend on April 4th 2023 my dad picked me up from school I got suspended for fighting and I went home my dad all of the sudden just hugged me and I hugged him has tight as I could then a few hours later he hugged me again said that he loved me and that he was going to get groceries he never came back I woke up around 8am to my brother and his gf asking me where dad was(not knowing anything)and I told him that he’s prolly at work he wasn’t I checked his location on my phone he wasn’t anywhere(his phone died)so as any 15 year old I went looking for him took me about 3 hours to do so but when I found him he was in a ditch(he used a .357 round to the head) I truly thought my dad had been killed until I saw the gun in his hand my first reaction was to take the gun and shoot myself in the head but I didn’t for some reason I called the cops they took me away from the crime scene and to the police station I had no tears (I cried I feel like was my entire body weight when I found my dad)now when I was at the station I had no tears while telling the story I hope to you all don’t commit suicide I feel like I may not be sure yet today is November 28 5:50pm,1
It doesn’t change,I wish I could tell the people I love how bad it’s gotten but whether I do or not will not change anything. It’s been the same cycle for the past 5 years and I not only mentally but also physically can’t handle it anymore. I’m only 17 and I’ve Tried everything everyone has told me and I always end up the same way. I’ve come to terms people don’t care about me after a while of struggling people get bored of caring. What I’m trying to say is there is absolutely no reason I should still be here and still suffering with no break,1
i want to kill myself because of my final exams,i’ve had suicidal thoughts for a while now since i was 12. due to my high school final exams i want to kill my self. i mean it’s not like im dumb or i do bad in most of my subjects but its just that math tests always get me. my parents have a such a high expectations when it comes to my math marks and i try to keep up with it. it’s not even like im not trying i do try this is the hardest i’ve ever studied for a test but i still end up getting a mark my parents will never be satisfied with. with my mid year report my math mark was really bad i passed but it was bad. math is the only subject that makes me feel like im dumb especially since everyone around me i see is doing better than me. my mom lashed out on me and she said words i thought she’d never say to me which made me have a mental breakdown when i was alone. i’ve never wanted to kill myself so badly now i think ill do it with the end of school so at the end of the week. im planning on taking out the baldes in a sharpener and slitting my wrists or using locking my door and hanging myself with a belt. i don’t know what to do. someone help me please.,1
Just some rambling. Im sorry for the wall of text...,"I 21m am currently jobless, and have no friends because i am ashamed to face them and havent talked to them for almost a year now. They all get their shit together and i am scared to go to work because i could do something wrong because i dont know something. I know its stupid but when i did my apprenticeship everything i did was wrong even though it wasnt and i always got told how dumb i am even though i was the 2nd best in my schoolyear with the written exams i got my practical exam done the second time but the first time everyone that went to where i did my exam failed so thats that. Everytime i did something everyone would hate on the methods i used even though they showed them to me and my boss would be an ass in one minute and a sweettalker in the other so i was always struggling with my emotions cause he would become soo nice all of a sudden. I never lied except about one thing and only because i was through with their bullshit about it but still i was marked as a cronic liar. I always took work from others if i had time or just cleaned up and repaired tools or threw broken ones out but still i was stamped as unwilling to work. I always asked about stuff to learn other ways just to have a bigger arsenal of tricks. Even though there was a language barrier i puzzled something together that i could refine with practice but i was never allowed to till someday i just got send alone to do it and then its my fault that i never done it. If i worked safely its wrong and the other way around too. If i learned something in school its wrong and if i told them something it was wrong but if they used my idea it was goot and got credited to another person. They destroyed my last bit of confidence and belief in myself. My heart gets put into a meatgrinder if i go to the cash register to pay or if i want to search for a job i get so anxious i get lightheaded. I am sad as long as i remember so lets say since 10 but i only actively selfharm since i started work so 5 years now i always think about killing myself or selfharm and i cant tell anyone because everyone just says ""Same"" or just blocks it of so i dont try again. I stood on a bridge a bit ago and wanted to climb over the reiling but then when people walked past me and didnt bat an eye i couldnt do it anymore. Even though i was obviously in distress they didnt notice or care so i went home laid in my bed and was numb if i can call it that. Ever since i walked away from my workplace i just feel like my body reacts like a puppet that someone other than me controlls if i see something sad my body reacts to it but i feel nothing but the obligation to feel saddened by it. I mean sometimes there are breakthroughs of feelings for no real reason like extreme anger because i stub my toe or that i find something so funny that i laugh for 5 minutes straight even though its not funny at all. And other times i dont feel a bit like my favourite movie that always made me happy and sad is just boring even though my body puts my heart in a press i emotionally dont feel anything or when i play a game i dont get even a bit angry but i dont feel joy either. I play because i would enjoy it if i wasnt like this. I cant drink or take drugs because i dont like the taste of it and the feeling of drugs im just a rat in a box that gets smaller and smaller every day without the strengh or courage to break out. I want to die but i cant do it because im scared of pain its come so far that i dont really care about the feelings of my family i just want to die. My family says they love me but i just want to die but im too scared of pain or waking up after a try to see them. I am too afraid to call the suicide prevention hotline or police and im also too scared to go to my doctor and tell him about it. I dont have a therapist and i cant get one fast just if i get into a mental hospital but then i would have to stay there but nobody is supposed to know about this. I know those things are to take with a big grain of salt but i tried every self diagnosing test for depression and they all told me that i am a high risk for myself and need to get to a doctor now. Even better help didnt want to help me because my answers made me to risky or something. I am getting pushed into a corner with my life and i cant stand up to it. I cant believe it got this far that i annoy strangers on the internet with my ramblings. Im sorry for the structure of this shit but its not my native language and i cant concentrate because i get overstimulatet by memories and pictures of selfmutilation. Again im sorry and if you want to know more just ask here or dm me and i will try to answer if i am awake that is.",1
Give me reasons not to kill myself 43M,"My girlfriend walked out on me after 2.5 years.  I now don't feel like doing anything.  No interests, no hobbies, no goals and no will to live. I don't think I can love again and don't expect anyone to love me.  She was everything to me. We were supposed to build a life together.  I really want to kill myself.",1
I want to die,The best way to describe my suicidal thoughts is it’s like I’m playing a video game that I used to enjoy and now I’ve stopped enjoying it. I’ve still got thousands of hours left of this game and I know that I’m never gonna enjoy it again. So the only thing that makes sense to me is to quit the game. Why suffer through a game I’m not enjoying,1
Just so meh,"I just feel I can't make anyone happy lately,  I was hoping to start a new job this week but haven't heard back from them yet and it's been driving my anxiety up the wall. My boyfriend has been irritable lately, which I wasn't even aware of because he is extremely well at hiding it and usually a super happy guy. I just wish I could just not cause him stress especially when he works very hard to keep me happy. My life isn't hard or bad, but sometimes I cannot help but feel suicidal,  like sometimes I feel it's the best option. I'm 30, with no real career for myself, I'll find a job and work there for awhile (like 6 months) then go find something else. Social anxiety is constantly running through my head and nonstop worrying about every little thing.  Being mtf I absolutely hate going out at times or being around others I don't know. I feel it'd just be easier if I just disappeared.",1

How are you actually supposed to be treated when you tell people you’re suicidal?,"I think I’m just coming to terms with the fact this will never be a real cause. Nobody cares, if they do care they don’t have space for you, if they have space for you they react all wrong. 

I don’t know what I’m supposed to be hearing from others right now. Nothing on Reddit counts to that, you have no idea who I am, or what I am to others. I do not believe life is inherently valuable, that doesn’t help me - my problem is it being selfish if I die, selfish if I leave to somewhere far, and selfish if I stay as-is. My partner is angry. My family either doesn’t think it’s that bad, or doesn’t care. 

Psych ER is not an option anymore for me in my area, and crisis services aren’t worth anything at all. Honestly the most effective thing I’ve ever done before attempting to kill myself was drive hundreds of kilometres without a phone into nowhere for three weeks. I have less than a dollar in my bank account so that isn’t an option anymore. 

What’s supposed to happen right now? What’s normal, what’s actually effective? I grew up in a situation that resulted with CPTSD so I’ve no idea what good, bad, healthy is.",1
I can’t take it anymore,"I am getting really fucking sick and tired of being on the run. At this point I don’t care if I’m ever safe or happy again I just want the bullshit to stop. I don’t care if by stopping it means dying.

I’m on the verge of homelessness because the people who owe my apartment complex, sold it to property developers who plan to demolish it by June. My lease ends in March. I’ve been looking around for new places to live and I haven’t found a single fucking thing I had my eye on one place and I’m not sure but I think it’s already taken. They said it wouldn’t be available until February but I went to the site to apply and I couldn’t select it for some reason.

I haven’t fucking felt safe since the start of the fucking 2020s. I wish the world had ended in that year if I’m being honest. My living situation hasn’t been stable since 2019. My roommates kicked me out before I even paid my first months rent because I had a seizure and had to be hospitalized. They were convinced I was on drugs, and I wasn’t. I even let them search all my shit and they didn’t fucking believe me. No one even knows why I had the seizure, but it wasn’t from fucking cocaine.

Then  I found an apartment somewhere with another roommate who tried to fucking kill me. We have been friends for two years and they seemed normal. Apparently they had psychotic symptoms because they went back-and-forth from acting normal to thinking that I was there douche bag, ex and trying to kill me. They refused to get fucking treatment for it. I didn’t have the money to live anywhere else. They finally left after completely vandalizing the place, which I did my best to fix, but ended up having to pay for damages anyway, because there was only so much I could do.

That financially ruined me, so I ended up in a complete shit hole for an entire year. Worst part of Ohio there was. Place was full of mold, I woke up to the sound of gunshots every goddamn morning, my neighbors were gang members, The entire building smells like fucking cigarette smoke, and was full of rats, roaches, mice, and mold. I couldn’t even use my own fucking shower, because gunk kept coming out of the drain while I was using it, and maintenance refused to do shit about it. It was freezing in the winter, because there was a gap between the wall in the floor that you could see daylight through and snow kept getting in.

Then I finally found this place. I thought I was fucking safe. No. God has other plans for me like making me fucking suffer. He wants to take away everything I’ve worked for - my boyfriend, my job, my home. I guess this is what I get for cutting contact with my family, even though those people did stuff to me that makes me want to  throw up. Doesn’t matter if she abused me, I’m still an evil person for leaving my mom after my dad died which must be why God is punishing me with homelessness.

I’ve lost most of my friends because they think that I try to involve myself with drama. They think that I purposely get myself in a shitty situation like this because I’m so bored with my own life. I need the excitement. Little did they know I fucking hate excitement. I hate adventure. I hate traveling. It pisses me off so much when they say shit like, “when are you ever going to grow up and settle down?” I’d fucking love to, but the Lord has other plans for me like punishing me for not “honoring thy father and mother”.

At this point, I don’t care if there’s a light at the end of the tunnel I just want it all to end, and I don’t care how it happens.",1

Wishful thinking.,I hate myself more each day. I wish I could slit my throat and stop the endless pain inside me. I wish it would all just go away. I wish I could disappear. I wish I would stop existing.,1
I honestly don't Understand why I survived.,"This is my first time posting here, so I don't know if I am even in the right place, but I just need some perspective or something. For any help I'm an HSP, an introvert, and have deep social anxiety, like ""my head throbs when buying groceries from fear of being attacked"" anxiety.

To begin, in the summer of 22 I tried ending it. It was a knee jerk response to the stress my family was putting on me, but I still believe it was the right decision, nothing has changed to make me feel like I should be alive and that I'm grateful it didn't work. If anything it drives me mad, I cut steak with that knife for crying out loud!

But more to the point, I have tried so many things to justify my continued existence, and while most haven't worked out, there is one with the tiniest chance of giving me purpose.

I am trying to work on a video game project, one that I had hoped could try and change people's minds about serious subjects like racism and wealth inequality, etc. But it feels like no matter how I try to justify it, I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels, doing it to try and help but knowing I will have 0 impact or going in the opposite direction and make things worse.

A lot of the advice you get about this is to not care what others think and just keep working, or the people who do care will come when you put yourself out there. To that I say so segregation is the answer? I want to mend things, not put up more walls, more boxes for people to hide in.

So I guess I'm just trying to understand why I'm still trying when I've already settled on the hopelessness of life here. If I'm not going to change anything, if I don't want to do this for the money, and if I know I'm going to die alone regardless, why the FUCK am I still doing any of this? Why does my suffering continue when I just want peace, by death or any other means.",1
Family triggers,"My very religious family said some things this holiday that triggered my suicidal thoughts. After the holiday I spend a day and a half to myself, ignoring everyone and self harming myself to try to stop myself from doing something more permanent. A couple family members reached out to tell me I should talk to them, but I know they’re lying because I know they see suicidal people as selfish and sinful. I know I can’t talk to them so I just made excuses. Now after I emerged from my room after feeling a bit better, everyone is angry at me and is ignoring my presence even when I’m at the table or in the room with them. This is making it so much worse. I just pray for one person to enter my life who will have understanding and love for me enough for me to be able to be honest. I don’t want to die but I just feel so worthless.",1
Music is the only thing that’s keeping me alive,"I’ve been suicidal my whole life. 

I’m a messed up person and that will never change. I’ve met a lot of friends who can resonate with my darkness. But, all of them have made it out some how. 

I get left behind with all the dirt, and I want so badly to just be gone but I can’t. 

I thought I had reasons to live but I’m so selfish, I can’t withstand the hard stuff. I don’t want to. 

My dad died of cancer when I was 19. I have a really awkward and tumultuous relationship with my mom. Think Ginny and Georgia. 

I think I would have wanted to live if my dad was alive and my sister didn’t have complications from a surgery and end up the way she did. 

If I didn’t have to see her suffer every day. If I didn’t have to stay here for her. If my car didn’t crash. If I had anyway out. 

I live in spite of all of this. I revolt, because that’s what Camus told me to do. Keep pushing that boulder up the hill in defiance. 

Happiness will never keep you alive, but revolting will. And that’s supposed to be a life well lived, a way out of the perpetual purgatory. 

Why am I here instead of my dad or my sister who would do so much more than I would with my breathing lungs or my able body. 

And why is this so casual to me? I thought I would learn to respect life more than this. 

Instead I play with cutting myself just to see my own blood to prove I’m human and not just some sick delusion living inside someone else’s head. 

I’m a freak and even the freaks don’t like me. 

Music is the only thing that keeps me here and I can’t even bring myself to write it anymore. 

Back to perpetual tab browsing of midi keyboards and waking up with intense suicidal  ideation everyday, only looking for a way to hurt myself further, because I only live for masochism, fantasy, and dopamine. 

But, anyway take it from me so you understand. 

Why would I want to be here. 

Can’t find love because the men are too porn sick. Can’t find solace because my sister is suffering everyday and my mom won’t do her part the right way. Can’t find hope to get out because there is none.

Drowning in how awful my life is. I can't catch a fucking break.," I'm autistic, have adhd, an autoimmune disease and have trouble with psychosis. I'm staring down the barrel of diabetes and I have three really swollen lymph nodes that are terrifying me. I have to live with my grandparents and my grandmother, who I've lived with my entire life died last month. She wasn't a grandmother she was a parent to me. My grandfather is an asshole and abusive who yells over needing toilet paper. One of their last conversations was him berating her over it the night before she died. Now I'm alone with him. This house doesn't feel like my home anymore. All her love from it has been sapped away and it feels so damn cold, so icy and frigid. It doesn't look the same at all, it doesnt feel the same. It feels like a cavern made of ice in Antarctica.

I can't work because I'm disabled and I haven't even BEGUN getting disability yet so I can get away from this man. My real mother is useless. I have no friends. My only friend was my 13 year old cat who died three weeks before my gram and 4 days before my birthday. I don't know what to do now. I NEED to get away from this house and him because I feel so terrible every day but disability will take years. What the hell do I even do? I want to run outside in 20 degree weather and get hypothermia. FUCK",1

I want to overdose tonight.,I’ve overdosed 3 times in the past and each time I’ve been in hospital on a drip. I’ve been saving loads of random tablets for months in hopes I’ll have enough to kill me. This time I’m not going to tell anyone or go to the hospital straight away.,1
Existential dread and money/disability issues,"I have existential dread and think that there probably won't be anything after death, I struggle with that a lot, panpsychism thinks that there is consciousness in all things so maybe that gives some hope, however I can't believe any religion that science doesn't support. My only hope is that consciousness can exist in things outside the brain.  


Anyways I'm in extremely bad health, morbidly obese, diabetic, and the money me and my girlfriend can make can barely afford food, and we're a few hundred short each month on bills, but we get by. I want to improve my health, but carbs are cheap, and aren't filling, so i eat more of them, and losing control of my diabetes. I'd cook healthier  but buying healthier foods while still getting enough to eat is impossible. I can't work regular hours due to my health (I can barely be standing/sittting for 1-15 minutes to cook, if buying groceries by the time I'm checking out my body is done. I can't actually work the way I am.) Now my car is leaking coolant and even i I fill it, it still overheats immediately, so that takes away all the food delivery apps I'd be able to work when my body allows.

Knowing there will be nothing someday makes me want to keep going if I'm enjoying life, but not keep going if I'm suffering, and so much the bad is outweighing the good.

I've been thinking about ending it,"I recently received a positive test result for HSV2 genital herpes. My ex did not disclose to me that he had it. When I confronted him about it he proposed to me and then tried to convince me to have sex with him. I ended up leaving his house screeching tires. I haven't spoken to him in a month and have been a complete wreck. When I started showing symptoms I originally thought I had a uti but something just felt off. Prior to me getting tested I looked down there and was completely mortified by what I saw. I can't get the image out of my head. I see it constantly throughout the day. I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and bpd for over 12 years now. I found myself asking why I've even been fighting for so long. I see posts online constantly saying it's just a skin condition or it's not that bad but I'm sorry that's far from the truth. I live in a small town in the south and grew up catholic before going non-religious. I'm not financially able to move. A diagnosis like this in the south is a death sentence. If even one person in my town finds out that's it for me. Love is not an option anymore. Marriage is not an option for me anymore. Children is not an option for me anymore. I don't have family support or friend support. My childhood was plagued with emotional loneliness and I can't live the rest of my life like this. I used to think people still had at least a little ounce of compassion. The amount of people I've seen on this site say they don't disclose their status because it's not that big of a deal! People will just be ready to ruin other people's lives so they can live in comfort. Not every body has support and when you add mental illness to that they don't understand how devastating and dangerous that can be. I don't want to die but I can't fathom living life so utterly alone. It doesn't matter how I got this. All that matters is that I do. A man is never gonna want to have anything to do with me much less marry me where I live. And i cant say i blame them. Its valid. Herpes is disgusting. The itching, the pain, the smell. Its awful and so so traumatic to go through everyday. Ive been in an outbreak for over a month now. I'm in no way shape or form trying to make anybody else who has an HSV diagnosis feel bad themselves. Im just stating how i feel about it. It's crazy because I really did just destroy myself in the process of wanting to build a life with somebody. I work in a nursing home. I know where we're all gonna end up. I can't live life never able to be emotionally or physically intimate with somebody and then waste away in a nursing home. One of my patients gave me a hug the other day and I almost broke down in tears knowing that's not something i will ever get to experience again. I live in fear everyday that I'm gonna accidentally pass it on to somebody. I'm constantly washing my hands. I refuse to use the bathroom unless I'm at home. I won't eat around people. I can't even look myself in the mirror and just showering is traumatic enough. When my parents look at me all I feel is guilt and shame. I've been thinking about ending it for two weeks.

i dont know how to help my friend and i'm the only one who knows how she feels,"I'm friends with this girl on Discord and I've known her for about a year, maybe a little more. We've met in real life and we are close. She came to me about two weeks ago and told me her boyfriend broke up with her and she's been really upset about it, but lately, it's become much worse. She basically told me that she's suicidal and doesn't see any point in living because she has nothing to look forward to. She said that she tried to kill herself last night but stopped and went to sleep.  


I asked if she's told anyone else how she feels and she said no, only I know about it and I don't know how to feel about that. On the one hand, I'm happy to help her and try to talk to her and talk her down but on the other hand, I'm not a therapist and I hate that the only thing I can say to her is that I'm here for her and I'm sorry she's going through this. I really don't know what to do and it scares me because I feel responsible if she were to do something because I'm the only one who knows.

&#x200B;

I don't want to tell my other friends because I feel like it would just make it worse if she found out I told them and I don't want it to feel like I'm betraying her trust if she's not telling them on purpose. I'm just half freaking out right now because I'm not sure what more to say or how to help her. ",1

"Bad thoughts, and the main character is me","
I feel different from all the women and girls I've met. I have hollow thoughts, literally with nothing. I've been dissatisfied with my choices for 7 years, regretting many things and situations I've put myself into.

An abusive relationship has rendered normal connections with men impossible. The echoes of screams, chokes, and kicks persist. Consequently, social phobia grips me, hindering interactions. While I cherish solitude, its weight can become wearisome. I love being alone but sometimes loneliness gets tiring

I've attempted suicide so many times, but I can't even get that right. At most, I become a burden to others. I'm desperate inside, but on the outside, everyone thinks I'm fine. I'm on the verge of exploding but I'm too tired to do it. I attend therapy and see a psychiatrist, and it's not their fault if I lie/omit some information; it's my fault.

I am so exhausted. Even as I rise early from bed, I’m already preparing to sleep again, in a melancholic embrace.
I find myself unable to die, yet living feels equally elusive. 

What kind of life is this?

I was so stupid and my heart is breaking i cant live and breathe without him , he's everything for me.Other than my mom he was the only one there for me and i am so alone and i feel so much hate towards myself,i don't want to live anymore, everything is crumbling down and i see no future without him ,i cant do this anymore i don't deserve to live after everything i did to my sweet boy after all the hurt he experienced because of me.

I don't know why I always have this thought that life it's just not for me, that the pain hurts too much and the joy isn't that good to balance it out.

If I had siblings I’d probably do it. I don’t have good friends, nobody at work gives a shit about me, if I died people would probably occasionally remember “Eli the girl who killed herself” for a week or two but nothing past that. I’m shitty anyway. I never cover peoples shifts at work. I never clock in earlier or stay later than I have to.

Scared of hurting my family by leaving.,"I'm a 20f, with Panic disorder, social anxiety and depression. All my life I have struggled with mental health issues. But recently it's getting too much for me to bear. I have been severely depressed for the past 5 years, however I've tried several anti-depressants with only one kind of helping. I've wanted to end it for 2 years now, recurring thoughts every time something gets too difficult for me.

My family is now pressuring me to get a job, and it is understandable but I am not sure how I can when I'm barely holding my self together as it is. I feel like I'm putting on an act every day, pretending to be happy for my family and friends when I feel like I'm slowly breaking down on the inside. How am I supposed to have a job, sitting behind a till or interacting with other people when I am already wanting to die, and I have social anxiety on top of it?

It doesn't seem feasible for me to stay and I'm scared, because I love my family, pets and friends. But everything else is too much for me to withstand. I haven't told my family how bad I've started to feel recently, because I feel like a burden to them, nor have I told my friends because I feel like I will drag them down and it feels like it's my burden to bare anyway, I feel selfish for feeling this way. I don't want to hurt them, but leaving, which feels like my only way out, would inevitably break their hearts.

I am torn between the guilt of breaking their hearts, and the pain on continuing to live. I don't see a way out. I've tried talking therapy, anti-depressants and even alternative medicine. I just don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to be able to fit into society like everyone else seems to do so easily, not have this constant weight on my shoulders making me feel like I'm drowning.  


I have no purpose for this post, I just wanted to get it off my chest and rant about how I'm feeling.",1

Suicide will be the happiest event of my sad lonely life,"I cannot wait to die and see the end of this torture I am forced to exist in. I wish I didn’t have to be alone 24/7 but unfortunately that will never change. 

I detest my life. I wish I was never born in the first place. All the odds are against me. I’ll probably never really live my life the way I want to be living it. I’ll always be in my parents’ shadow and miserable. 

Whenever I think about moving out of the state I’m currently living in to the east coast where my relatives live, I suddenly start feeling a lot better. Like there’s an end to this torture I’m currently trapped in. But in reality that will probably not happen fast enough and I’ll probably get so fed up with the 24/7 loneliness, isolation and dead silence I have to deal with every single day that I’ll kill myself in August 2025 just to get some peace of mind. 

I’ll probably never be happy. My chance of happiness ended ever since I was born here. All I have left to experience in my future is more chronic loneliness, isolation, depression, emptiness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and stress. 

The day I kill myself and end this hell will be the absolute happiest day of my life.",1
it’s not like anyone cares if i die,"17f and going to kill myself soon enough. the sole reason i am typing this now is bc of my parents and some friends, but even these reasons are slowly fading. my friends are starting to slowly hate me i know it. and my parents would prolly disown me for any mistake anyway so.

i don’t have hope to live. i’m horribly fat and ugly and untalented and dumb and a bad person who just happens to care more than the average human.

i won’t ever be free. it’s not like my communist overcontrolling parents will ever let me live even if i’m independent. they just have to spy on me and my crazy strict aunt spies on me too. i never feel safe or free. and pls don’t tell me to talk to them about this. i tried. they’re eastern european hun they won’t get it.

i won’t ever experience having a true social circle and many friends and parties. i mean, i think i have really good friends, they’re like 3 or 4, but slowly they are becoming annoyed by my presence. i care even for people who barely know me, i always make sure everyone is ok. just tonight a guy friend i rlly cared about removed me from his close friends list just because he supposed that i liked him (he’s gay btw) and this shit hurt a lot.

i won’t ever be succesful. i am just not born in the right country. i am not allowed to immigrate despite being an immigrant even in this country that i have lived in since i was 3. i won’t get my dream job or have money or fulfill my dream to sing. one year ago i got on stage to a school event with a cold, i had to sing and failed and everyone still laughs at me for it.

i won’t ever be pretty. i go to the gym right now but since i am a loser the only things making me happy are sweets. i have bad features overall. plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures are expensive and even if i ever get the money i will feel guilty for not being natural.

i won’t ever be loved. i don’t even deserve it. even tho some of my friends confessed they have had crushes on me i still think they did it just to hype me up. everyone around me has a relationship or a situationship and kisses people and has sex and will probably get married one day, meanwhile i’m bi and failing in both genders.

i don’t want advice on how to get better, i just wanna know which is the quickest and least messy method. it’s over for me.",1

I need to share something,"So if you have been following you know about Bella, so she told me back in February of 2022 that she would blame herself if I committed suicide. But then the next month I told her I would blame her if I did kill myself, since after I said that our friendship was NEVER the same since then. And I feel like it’s my fault that she hates me, because in December of 2022 I told her I would call the cops on her to see her reaction she told me to “fuck off”. 

I feel like if I killed myself she would be happy, because I wouldn’t be snitching on her anymore. Because I was upset and I told her mom and now bella wants me dead, she didn’t ever tell me that I just know she thinks that. 

I feel like she would forget about me if I did kill myself, I feel like she would be relieved knowing that I’m gone. I know she would NEVER think that, but I know she will be in my head. 

What am I supposed to do, because in July I told someone to tell her that I kms. And she called and texted me all mad, idk if she was mad because I told her mom or she is mad at the fact I lied. Idk it seems complicated to me, I didn’t ever mean to be a burden to her but I was. 

She seems happier in her insta posts that she’s no longer my friend, idk what to do. Maybe she misses me and wonders how I’m doing, she left even though she knew how hurt I would be if she did leave. Like did she ever think about how it would affect me, because I told her she hurt me after Christmas of ‘22 and she just blocked me. 

Idk why she did do it because I apologized? I feel like she never wanted to be in my life, I know she probably thinks about me sometimes. And I just miss her I miss her being my friend, I so badly want her as my friend again. Maybe she still cares about my feelings but she did tell me “Idc” so I guess that’s something, but how could I piss her off that much where she could hate me to the point of not caring about my wellbeing. She did pretty much ignore me for 4 months because I was snapping her too much, so idk what to say. 

Like I tried not being a fuck up to her, but unfortunately I am a fuck to to her. But I know it’s my fault that she left her college, because I got accepted now all of a sudden she’s not attending that school anymore. I’m pretty sure her mom has something to do with this, because it doesn’t seem like something Bella would do just to make me feel bad about myself. 

I know Bella just transferred without reason, and I’m that reason. I mean maybe idk I’m not sure, but would anyone actually miss me if something happened to me. Idk if she would care or come to my funeral if I died, I feel like she would be happier since I’m not in the way.

Ich schaffe kein Real abschluss,"Ein Roman (novel) ist eine literarische Gattung, die als Langform der Erzählung oder narrative Langform beschrieben wird. Ein Roman ist meistens in Kapiteln (chapters) aufgebaut. In einem Roman werden fiktive Ereignisse beschrieben und die Entwicklung einer Hauptfigur (protagonist) wird erzählt. Der Leser lernt dabei den Protagonisten in verschiedenen Situationen mit unterschiedlichen Personen kennen.  
  
Im Gegensatz zu einer Short Story ist ein Roman sehr komplex. Das bedeutet, dass Romane vielschichtige Handlungsstränge und verstrickte Figurenkonstellationen beinhalten. In einem Roman sind zeitliche Sprünge, wie Rückblicke (flashbacks) oder Vorausschau (forecast), möglich. Außerdem ist es möglich, dass die Erzählung aus verschiedenen Perspektiven beschrieben wird (Perspektivenwechsel, engl. change in perspective). Zu post-colonial novels werden Romane gezählt, die in ehemaligen britischen Kolonien verfasst wurden. Diese Romane, häufig von afrikanischen, indischen oder pakistanischen Schriftstellern verfasst, thematisieren das gegenwärtige Leben von Menschen in früheren Kolonien und von Immigranten in Großbritannien (immigrants in Great Britain). Dabei sind Themen wie Armut (poverty), Diskriminierung (discrimination), Ungerechtigkeit (injustice) und Integrationsprobleme (difficulties in integrating) charakteristisch für post-colonial novels.

I honestly can't take it anymore,"For the past 19 years of my life, I have suffered. Constantly. I had to move to a foreign country when I was 7, because my mum couldn't find work. My bio dad cheated on my mum, they divorced when I was 8 and I haven't heard from him since. From what I know, they've started a family, and he's got a daughter he actually loves now. My mum had found a partner, who had abused both me and my mum, several times. He threatened to take my life, a 10 year olds life. Several times the police was called, yet every time she took him back. She had then found a third partner recently, and he has also threatened violence against me. A couple of years ago, my mum and my dad had became severly overweight, and both of them had fallen into disability. Both of them are essentially bedridden, and struggling with mental health issues. My little brother, who's 8, has autism, and is severely autistic. Since I'm the only able one in the entire house, I'm the one that does practically everything. Laundry, cooking, cleaning, looking after my brother, and the family dog, fixing anything that breaks, getting medication, shopping, etc. I'm trying my best to keep things running, yet my stepfather says he's sick of me, wishes I was gone, and that ""I'm my mother's son and he wishes he never related to me"". The kicker, is that because of the move (for context, me and my mum moved from Poland to the UK, Scotland specifically) I hold no rights here, since my mum never applied for any form of citizenship or settled status in the UK, which means I cannot find work or go to any form of higher education at least for the next year.

Trying to access mental health care is overwhelming me,"I get outpatient psychiatric care to manage my MDD and anxiety (really CPTSD). I used to get some psychological services but lost them when the clinic I use refocused on acute patients. I'm not making much progress so I contacted my first choice outpatient mental health provider for an intake. On the triage call I confessed to some active suicide planning. So now, instead of getting on a two month waiting list for services, they require that I go to a psych ER for visit and progress notes stating that I am mentally fit and not in dire need.

I've been to psych ERs before. It's a terrible process that I don't want to go through again. Like 8 hours with no phone or distraction of any kind, or worse. I keep making the mistake of being fully honest about my symptoms, rather than downplaying them, and losing or complicating access to care.

Edit to clarify - I wouldn't mind walking in and out to get the paperwork, but I don't want to spend 4 hours waiting to get admitted then 4 hours under observation waiting to speak to a doctor. I don't suppose it's possible to make an appointment to speak to an ER doc?",1

I hate myself so much,"Hi everyone I’ve never posted here before, but was drawn to the sense of community of those who might feel the same I do. This will probably be a novel.

For as long as I can remember I’ve been depressed and suicidal from childhood to now 23F. I tried to kill myself in 2016 and failed. That was the lowest part of my life and gave me sort of drive to better myself. Lose weight, gain confidence, and I got recruited for college sports. And things were great for those 4 years. I made the best friends I could ever have and I was healthy, athletic, skinny, and had hope for the future. 

I met my fiancé in 2020 and ended up moving away from my family and hometown and more near his family and my college town. I miss my family a lot, though I do get to drive down 5+ hours to see them sometimes. 

So now I am working nights in a field that I never saw coming, it’s not my college degree and it’s also not fulfilling. The only thing keeping me there is that the pay is great, and we need to save for our wedding next year. 

Working this job and moving here I have gained so much weight I don’t even recognize myself, I hate myself so much. I have lost so much confidence, I can’t even tell if I have a personality anymore. I sleep throughout the day and work at night, most of these past few months I don’t even remember. I have no motivation to lose weight or get up out of bed. 

Maybe it’s the change from college to now I just have to get use to. Maybe some people are reading this and ready to question why I’m still here or maybe blaming my fiancé. I love him so much he is truly my best friend and I would do anything for him. I have told him how I feel to a degree a few times but I don’t know if he truly understands I’m at a point where I just crave suicide at times. I can’t tell if it’s just like ideation but I just convince myself it’s the only and best solution. Then I think I can’t to that to him or my family. My grandmother passed in August, and before that I always said I couldn’t let my grandmother live to see me die, so that was always my reasoning to stop. 

The light at the end of the tunnel is that after the wedding, being able to move somewhere else and pursue a new career. But still right now I just hate myself so much I have no drive for tomorrow. I feel disgusting and idk how my fiancé still wants to be with me. I hate myself so much.",1

Even dying is exhausting. That’s the only thing keeping me from it.,"‘And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy 
They'll think of me kindly 
When they come for my things’ - mitski, last words of a shooting star

These lyrics really sum it up for me. It is exhausting even to die. I barely have the energy to do it in a dignified way. 

I just want it to be over so badly, but even the act itself is a whole big endeavour. There are so many things to get in order first. I have to give work my four weeks notice that I’m quitting (and withstand working there, existing, even longer). I have to clean my room, aka, the depression pit, get rid of stuff… i don’t want my sister to have to do that. I have to erase all my files. Probably the most painful thing: I have to write goodbye/apology messages to everyone in my life. 

My story for anyone who cares to read it - hopefully it will make you feel less alone:

I’m a 21 y/o girl. Ill start from the beginning. Had a shitty start. My parents were in a violent marriage and i lived in fear everyday. There’d be blood on the walls and constant fighting. My mother had bipolar, and my dad was emotionally very absent. Id go to school terrified my mother would be dead when i came home. I was always awful at making friends and have been bullied and virtually friendless most of my life - in hindsight, probably undiagnosed autism. I am also fairly certain i was molested when i was a child by my dad though my memories are fuzzy. I have never told anyone about this besides a friend at a party when i was drunk.

My mother then died of cancer when i had just turned 15. I remember a few days before she was diagnosed my dad kicking her in the stomach. The domestic violence situation was still ongoing and we were homeless for a little bit living on one of my sisters couches in her tiny flat while my mother was in her final stages of cancer. No one ever told me she was terminal. I still had to go to school. Didnt get a lot of qualifications from my exams because of my situation i was just not mentally able to take them with all i was dealing with. My dad was not capable of stepping up and taking care of me. I went to live with my sister. She is a shopping addict who loves to live above her means and has continuously racked up debt and taken out insane credit card loans to buy random shit. I had to bail her out of this debt with half of the money my mother left me when she died.

I lost all my friends after a fall out leaving highschool. Have only had online friends since. My only real life social contact has been my boyfriend. Every time i have tried to make friends it has never worked. 

I dropped out of university due to my mental health this year and have been working awful retail jobs. I have trouble fitting in everywhere. My social anxiety is debilitating and i live every day in constant fight or flight, terrified. My coworkers don’t really like me because im ‘quiet’. 

Ive been looking into reapplying to university to give another go at the only thing i have ever loved and been any good at, writing - (i wanted to be a language teacher and hopefully one day an author) but because i dropped out i have wasted the bulk of my student loan. I cant afford to pay the tuition fees.

The kicker is that i would have been able to afford it if i didn’t have to give my sister half of my savings to pay off her debts. Theres absolutely no hope for me anymore. Every time i try im hit with another roadblock. Its like i wasnt meant to be happy. I’m done trying, i’m done holding on. I don’t want to suffer anymore. I have seen life and i don’t want it. I never did.",1
Unemployment executive,"So yeah, I'm 53f, with a 33 year marriage that rocks, a great husband, 2 grown great boys. 

I'm a healthcare CFO executive.  I got fired in July. CEO and I didn't mesh,  I am actually not missing the behavioral health hospital.

I can't get a job. It's been over 4 months. I am so mad at myself. For getting fired, for not finding anything yet,  for not being stronger. I've been a mess. It's so bad now, I haven't gotten out of bed in a week. I cry all the time.  Hubby has been great,  but even he is getting frustrated with me now.

I don't see any reason to go on. I'm just exhausted and done.",1
what else to do other than overdose?,"i'm a minor. nowhere i can get stuff that would immediately kill me. but i do have a few packs of xanax that i was prescribed. i just need to find them since they're all scattered all around the house without looking suspicious. so does anyone know what i can do? it's night and i don't really know what to do since it's urgent. or if i somehow change my mind tonight, it'll still be useful to know what to do in the future.

i have a not so small scalpel. i thought of just slitting my wrists but that's too gore-y, you know?? don't want my family to see that since it would make things even worse. no matter what kind of a person you are, you don't deserve to see that - is what i think. so, any ideas somehow??",1
break up depression and abandonment issues,"Last month, my girl friend broke up with me. It wasn’t surprising, but sudden. She already broke up with me after our first month together, but we decided to try, and she did come back. 3 months together, and it was final; she left me.

I suffered depression from this. I look at my friends who have gone through the same thing, and I wonder if they also react the same way I do behind closed doors. Probably, but I don’t know.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts since, and I still do. I attempted multiple times to choke myself just to see if I could take it. Right now, my best option is to just jump off a tall building. I already have the place; I am just waiting for the right time.

Other than my breakup, I have also been struggling in school. I had to retake a major subject twice, and I’m still not sure if I will pass this semester. 1 year is added to my college years. I just get sad thinking about some of my friends living their lives as sophomores while I am stuck in freshmen year.

But I never shared all my academic struggles with my ex-girlfriend. I always wanted her to be able to depend on me. I never showed any weakness that could make her second-guess our relationship—that is, until the first time she broke up with me.

I have just always been so scared of being left alone. I try so hard to get people to stay. Now that she’s left me and I am all alone, all my problems have gotten worse. I don’t know if I can take it anymore. And for sure, there will be more pain in the future, and I don’t know if I can handle that.",1
Professor saved my life,"The quarter I took with with him was the worst time of my life. I fought my roommate and lost my friendship with them, moved out because of it, my parents divorced, I went through several natural disasters, and was stalked by men online. (I’m a woman.)

It crept into the class. My first project was going well, but I couldn’t get a file to work. I threw my laptop on the floor, curled up into a ball and shook. He rushed over and placed his hand on my shoulder, looking concerned. It wasn’t much, but it meant a lot to me. 

Unfortunately, things got worse.

I failed the second project because it didn’t meet the professor’s requirements. I’d sat with him and gone over it, tried to fix it, and I still failed. He  gave a scathing critique of it in class, saying it looked “half-finished”, even though I’d fixed it from his comments. And this was days after the roommate situation and creepy stalking.

It was too much.

Everything bubbled over and I panicked. I ran out of class, tears in my eyes. I tore up my project and threw it in the trash, then slumped against the classroom door. I banged my head against the floor to kill myself, screaming “I want to die” so loud that everyone heard it. Even after that stopped, I still had suicidal thoughts, sobbing and hyperventilating.

What happened next is something I’ll never forget.

My professor made his other students keep working, then left the classroom and found me. He crouched down and asked if I was okay. Of course I wasn’t, I was wheezing and crying. He went into the classroom and got a chair, and instructed me to sit down. As I did, he grasped my hands and made me take deep breaths, demonstrating them himself. At this point, I cried from the horror at being so emotional in front of him. He then asked “Do you need some water?” and before I even croaked “sure”, he came back with a bottle and the dean, phone on line with a  counselor.

We ended up talking for a half hour, and I left the room because it was a private conversation. At the end, the professor came and brought all my stuff back, as I’d left it in the classroom. I was stunned. He didn’t have to do that. He didn’t have to do any of this. And yet he did.

I apologized for being an idiot, and he said “no no, it’s fine, you’re fine.” We had an academic meeting afterwards since I missed a good chunk of that class, and the first thing he asked was “How are you feeling? Is your head okay?” (I had gotten a head injury from my attempt). Again, he didn’t have to do that either, but he did. He chose to.

After the meeting, I broke down crying. Not because I was sad, but because I felt heard. Someone actually gave a shit about my struggles and didn’t think I was exaggerating. They didn’t think of my suicide attempt as a cry for attention. They actually understood. Not even my own father believed in mental health.

And, ironically, it was from a man his age, who
just failed me and criticized my work.

He doesn’t know this, but he saved my life that day. When he found me, I was on the verge of killing myself. So many horrible things happened in those past few months, and I shattered. I was convinced life wasn’t worth living anymore, and he proved that wrong. He showed that there’s people in the world who care and give a shit about you.",1

"No, I don't think I am suicidal but","I want to end it all, not like in a dramatic way because I don't like the attention. I am like the middle child of life. Even my story is bland.

I am 22, used to be the stereotypical funny guy like chandler or barney type of funny but that only applies in a positive way when you got the looks. Its really hard to be funny in real life when its also the only thing that gives the reason for people to talk to you.

Apart from that, I really like helping people in various things like psychological support, advise on decisions or physical work. I always try two or more times reaching out to person who shut themselves. Even after being insulted for being nosy or not being cared, I wanted to make them feel like they matter. I don't really like asking for anything in return. I didn't want to burden anyone of my issues or whatever that bothered me. I'd like to sleep with the thought someone being grateful for me or so I thought. Being kind has got me nowhere but I never once regretted because somehow I felt better when I made someone else feel better.

I thought someday someone will reach out to me and be the person I was to them. After few years of trying to make friends or getting into a relationship, I developed overthinking which I don't blame as a bad thing but I wish I could stop atleast for a few minutes when I am talking with someone. I always think about my insecurities and what the person is going to do next and if its going to hurt me I'd be prepared.

I don't hate anyone. I don't feel attached to anyone or anything. I am kinda tired and drained I guess. If anything I'd like to go while sleeping but I am scared of the dark emptiness after doing it so I am hesitant. I suppose my reason is not strong as someone who went through traumas in life.

So, If you're still reading this and you feel the same way or a different type of worse, I can be your friend or a well wisher if you are looking for one. Please reach out to me if you need someone to hear you. I'd be really glad if I can make your life a little better.",1
"Wrote a rant about the biggest cause of my depression, looking for some advice","I don’t expect people to read this whole thing, but I would appreciate some advice if you do. She was my best friend, when my mental health broke she was there to help me. We talked everyday for hours about random stuff because we were so close and she would help me with my mental health struggles all the time. She even talked me off a noose multiple times on days I said I might do it. I would talk to her when I was on a noose because I didn’t want to die alone and maybe a part of me wanted to live and knew she was the only one who could talk me down. Eventually I regrettably fell in love with her and I would beg her if we could try becoming a relationship(I never made threats of suicide if she said no I would just ask and try and convince). This happened after she said she used to have a crush on me and it kinda just kept growing with me hoping I could reignite her crush somehow. Eventually during the summer after junior year she said we could be a thing and maybe grow it into a relationship. I was happy for the first time that someone loved and cared for me enough to be with me. Eventually though she ended the thing and all the sadness and depression that I avoided that summer hit me at the same time and I almost killed myself. She decided to tell my parents which I don’t blame her for. Eventually she stopped talking to me slowly. It became we would call once a week then a month then eventually she just stopped talking to me. I sent her a cringe message begging for communication but she wouldn’t respond. I don’t blame her for that. Eventually I got better on my own and hoped that maybe if I got better we could be best friends again like we used to be. I eventually convinced her to let me call her so I can apologize and get some closure on what happened. During the call I apologized for the stress I caused her and asked if maybe we could try being friends again now that I’m better. She said she didn’t care that I was better and that we couldn’t be friends again. I asked if maybe I could say goodbye in person to her so I could maybe get some final closure but she refused. This began my relapse into depression, but it’s not as bad as it used to be. The last time I talked to her was when I asked for advice on what to do when someone put me in the same situation she was in with me. She blocked me after giving me advice. I eventually lied to myself and told myself that what we had back then was a relationship so that I could maybe have hope that one day someone else could love me and care for me again. I now know that will never happen and I was never in a relationship with her. I don’t hold romantic thoughts on her, I just miss our friendship. I think about her often and how it was all my fault that I lost my best friend. Sometimes I want to die so that maybe she might care about me again. The biggest mistake of my life was not getting help like she begged me to do. I just wish that I did when our friendship was still around. Now I’m in college and I have no one, the only thing my friends do is go to bars and I don’t like that stuff, because I had to give up drinking because it was hurting me. I feel like I have no one anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore I’m not exactly suicidal, but sometimes I’m plagued with negative thoughts that lead to suicidal thoughts.",1

How can I find inner peace to not be angry any more?,"I don’t want to get into my life, basically my friend groups have all split up viciously (one from rape and the other from cheating situation), my family members are all dying, and I lost my 7 year relationship due to anxiety about cheating that I don’t know happened or not.

I’m so angry all the time. I usually don’t punch things at work and I can still function at least for now. But it feels unbelievable that I am in this position now, I used to have a great support circle and now all I have left is my mom who is sick. I know others have even less, but I just can’t believe it. I hate myself so much. I wish I could just die, but I can’t keep hurting people. I hate the people who have made me think my gf betrayed me. I hate the things she’s done that made it hard for me to trust her. And I hate myself most of all for being too insecure and pathetic to just take her word. I hate myself for being too overcome by my own issues to help my one friend who got betrayed too. I hate that all I feel is anger, confusion, sadness, hate and shame, for months and months now.

All day I fantasize about slitting my throat or clawing at my wrists or smashing my head against something. I want to die in a car crash or maybe join the military so I can die on deployment and people won’t feel as bad as if I just killed myself. I want to talk to her again so badly. I can’t believe seven years of the only thing that gave me hope is ending like this it makes me fucking sick to my stomach. I want to be a kid again when everyone I knew cared for each other and I could believe what people said. I wish I knew how to fix my relationships but all I know is that I’m fucking trapped and powerless and pathetic and so fucking disgusting. I just want to have one day where I can wake up and not have to obsess over this anymore. I have no idea how to get there. I feel like for the rest of my life I will just be angry, hateful and sad, unable to trust anyone and unwilling to subject other people to who I’ve become. I’m just so angry. I’m so fucking endlessly angry. It’s bottomless and I don’t know how to channel it positively. I doubt I will be able to function in my life much longer and it all just proves what I’ve told myself all along that everyone around me would be fucking better off anyway. I wish when I tried to kill myself at 13 it had just fucking worked.

I hope that we are really just all projections and light bullshit so that when the Sun melts and our universe becomes nothing again. Eventually we will go around again and if I can change things then I will try to take these lessons with me to be happy again. Or if I can’t then I will not take it for granted and I’ll be sure to take pictures and journal so I can remember the good things. I know I won’t have another chance for a long time but I will wait as long as it takes on the off chance it’s possible. If not then I guess nothingness is better than this, I just hope everyone I know can find some kind of peace or happiness again even if it doesn’t include me.",1

I'm running out of options.,"Every single day is an argument and a screaming competition. My dad will scream at me over the smallest little mistake I make and it's been happening for long that everytime I make a mistake, I end up hating myself and profusely apologize over and over and over trying to keep a relationship intact. I dont know what to do. Growing up, all my classmates thought I was a school shooter because of how I looked and acted. It made me distance myself from everyone further until i just tried to not even exist in most people's minds. I'd even refrain from asking the teacher questions about assignments because I was afraid to make myself known. Fast forward to now, and most people who meet me think I'll be a shooter, or a public endangerment. I have no family to go to now. My mom left when I was 6 months old and I only have my dad as family. Our relationship has been horrible for a long time. I'm 80% sure he just deals with me and doesn't love me the way he used to. Nothing is sacred here. I have no idea what to even do at this point anymore. I love my dad, but he is a scary and aggressive person to be around. The slightest fuck up from me, the slightest little thing, like cutting up Turkey for the dog to eat in not small enough chunks, I will get screamed at, called an idiot, and then he will ignore me the entire rest of the day. I'm so sick and tired of this shit. My anger and pure blinding depression is so hard to hold back anymore, that even if I tried to hold it back, it will come out in an explosive fit of punching myself in the stomach and head aswell as uncontrollably shaking and crying.

The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself already is my family and friends who I know it would suck for them if I killed myself. I just don't know anymore man this whole life thing sucks ass.,1

I walk to work half the time.)

Was doing an collab and my character was heated but I was tired. They were arguing about bullshit. However, I received more bad news and snapped. It was por timing but ..  I can't do it anymore. I don't want to live anymore. Nobody can understand or will just listen. It's horrifying how little people understand when you say it so clearly.

Soul achingly alone,"My emotions and thoughts are so physically exhausting I resigned to take a nap. And in that semi lucid apace between waking and dreaming, the narrative of the dream started to shift to lucidity. And I'd imagined being held in an embrace. I was sleep enough I could physically feel the sensation of it. And it was the most comfort I've felt in ages. I want so badly to be held like that for real. To feel that wanted and loved. Life has yet to show that'll ever be meant for me. I've cast out my line time and time again, not even holding out for hope on a happy ending. I'd be content just simply to have something. In any regard. Platonic or not. But no. 

The house is stirring. The quiet and peace is gone. And fully returned to my waking moments I'm left alone with yet again the weight of the presence of the realization that the only one to comfort or hold or show me love is myself in my own thoughts and dreams. As always. 

It's been that way since I could remember. Even as a little kid, dreaming up adventures filled with friends where I could imagine I belong and am wanted. 

I wish I could have some sign that life won't always be this way. I'm exhausted.",1

so now, to finally break this cycle i must cut off all the people i love and feel loved by 
once that is done i already ruined the last part of my life i had left and i can finally go

But, when I start thinking about the ways I would do it, I get all panicky and terrified. Like what the actual fuck? I can’t even make up a plan without being scared? Holy shit this is so fucking whack.

What I actually want? To end up like an HP Lovecraft character, locked away in an asylum for the mentally anguished, living day by day according to the schedule of the state.

There's an indescribable, strange pressure from almost all the people I am in contact with - as a collective - to be brave enough to remove the cancer that I am, as a service to the community. 

To be clear: This isn't anyone else's fault, people just have a natural reaction to the repulsive person and energy I have self-sabotaged myself into existing as.

It's just more and more pathetic the more I try to look for a way to keep living, even with this note:
Stop squirming, these are the consequences of your actions. It's over. Admit your situation.

Some friends and family still try to hold onto the hope that I might come back and be able to join again, but they notice it too, that it probably isnt going to happen. 

I can feel their hope fading. It's heartbreaking.

Wish I Could Be Put in a Simulation Instead,"I know the technology isn't there for it, but the one big alternative I'd consider to ending things is being put in a simulation.

If I could just have some of my memories wiped and be put into a simulation where I had my previous girlfriend back, was financially independent, lived in my own house, was a successful writer and better looking then I could finally experience some happiness.

As it is, I know that's not possible. Even if that technology may be possible some day, who knows when? It hardly feels worth trying to suffer through decades more of life just to eventually hope to experience that.

So I don't actually have that alternative. But I do like to fantasize about it sometimes, I have to admit.

The idea of being able to be put in a simulation where everything is better and not having to die seems so much better than having to confront the awful reality. Which is that I have no choice but to end things or be miserable and in pain for the rest of my days.",1
Pets,What happens to your pets? If you actually go through with it and end your life. do you think they find new homes or get discarded?,1
Am I a selfish person?,"Using a throwaway account.

I've been wrestling with feelings of wanting to commit for years. Recently, my mom got scheduled for a major surgery at the hospital. Wednesday night, I dropped everything to go over and sit with her and watch TV to make her feel better; Friday, I got laid off at work (it wasn't a complete surprise, but it was still a kick in the balls); Saturday morning, I was supposed to meet up with my dad and then go over to see her. 

I slept in because I was worried about work and the assholes next door decided to throw a party late, and I called up to check in on my mom and mentioned that I'd had a sleepless night. She was having a bad day and I guess she thought I was going to make it all about myself (I really wasn't; I just brought it up because I didn't know if I was going to meet my dad on time), and she said she didn't want to see me. Okay. 

Then my dad met me and lectured me about how my mom didn't want a visit and I was stressing her out with being really fat and behind in my career. (I admit I went quiet here and didn't speak for the rest of the time we were together, my dad and I.) Then my mom called me up and said she didn't want to see me until after the surgery, and said that if she didn't make it through the surgery she loved me. Then she called me up again to say I was selfish and self-centered and I would be a bad therapist (what I want to go back to school for).

I just feel like the worst person ever right now--like I should be anxious and scared about the surgery rather than angry and upset. It's not like I wouldn't be there in an instant right now if she needed help, or go and get groceries for her or laundry or move furniture or anything else. I know she's scared and she's facing a lot of big fears right now.

It's just like... *am* I a selfish person? I was thinking recently one of the reasons I didn't want to commit was because it would my mom sad, and now this. Am I worthless and a bad person?",1

I’m done,"60 years of pain snd not fitting into the world. My partner has decided she’s too crazy to be my partner after promising me a home and a garage to build my art.

A few days ago she suddenly felt out of control and checked herself into a facility. I supported this and intended to help her decide her best options after talking to docs. 

Suddenly she’s like a different person and won’t tell me anything about her treatment and is saying she can’t have a partner and leaving without a home or ability to work and also, I’m devastated that our love which was so deep just seems to be gone.

6300mg of medicine. If that isn't a Lethal Dose I don't know what is. I can't do another overdose. I've nearly run out of medicine.

Idk how to talk about how intense my feelings are without scaring others. I know who to reach out to if it goes from passive ideation to active planning.

Not sure if I'll ever be happy again,"Today I had my first appointment with my therapist. It wasn't really how I expected it. I don't feel like she will be able to relate.

Anyway today is also the first time in a long time that I've felt a lot emotions again. Immediately after waking (before therapy) I felt ""empty"", where I usually feel ""numb"". Usually I feel too out of it to do anything and too anxious to do anything. I just don't feel anything normally.

I told my therapist about my ex, and she added more emphasis on the whole ""soulmate"" kinda thing. We have some crazy love story that almost seems like a movie. To summarize, we met online when we were 9, then Skyped 24/7 for 2 years with each other, never seeing each other in real life. Then we met again when we were 22, saw each other in real life and dated 2 years very intensely. She was the first friend I ever had, and when she contacted me at 22 I was at an all-time low. When we met in real life for the first time it was like we knew each other our entire life. My therapist was amazed at this, and I do like the validation that it's a movie kinda thing, but she reacted like she was amazed that it happened and like it was meant to be.

So I come home from therapy, actually kinda happy. Then stupid fucking me gets the idea to look at our photos. I haven't done this in 6 months. We're now 11 months past breakup. I saw her smile, and I noticed that her smile and her old photos made me smile. The old pictures of us made me so happy. Her smile made me so so happy.

I've been chasing happiness the first few months after the breakup. I tried doing everything they tell a depressive person. ""just do it even if you don't like it"". I went to the biggest festivals, only to not enjoy it. I'm trying on Tinder. I'm trying to make friends. It's so so so so hard. I just keep failing at it. For the past 5 months I've given up. I'm just not doing anything. Not going out. I don't even know what I'm doing, I think I watch TikTok all day.

I kinda understand why my mind has given up on emotions. Today I felt emotions and I've never been as suicidal as today. Before looking at the photos I already felt suicidal, but after the photos even more. I feel like I'm never going to experience the same happiness as I did when I was with her. It's not realistic. Our relationship was built upon fantasies.

I'm slowly going back to being my all-time low. Basically, someone who hates people, hates life, but is just living it day in, day out. Numb.

Being together isn't an option either, it would be a fucking disaster for both of us. We managed to constantly hurt each other and there is no way something will change.

I'm happy I'm feeling something again, but so afraid to lose it tomorrow as well. But maybe it's for the better. But then I'm fucking lost again. Now I at least have something identity-wise to hold on to (emotions). Then all that's left is the constant feeling of dissociation, failure, anxiety and not doing enough. No motivation to do anything.",1

Attempting For The first time,"(first of all, I want to apologize For My shitty english but please just ignore it)

I didn't expect this Day to become this early. I have Been close doing it like once but I have Been too scared accually attempting (mosly of The pain). But now it feels like its My Time to disapear. Even tho My Life isnt Even Bad or anything My mental health and school is too much For me to handle right now. I Even have good relationship with my parents, very good friends, good childhood, decent grades and stuff. But I'm too tired of My mental health problems and school pressuring me. Im sorry For My dearest friends who  did their best to Be There For me, but I'm too weak to fight with My own mind. My suicidal thoughts For The past few days has Been too much For me.

Today : I went to school Even tho I wanted to skip school (and slept 4 hours which makes all worse) but I didn't skip school because I had art classes and I wanted to see & spend Time w My friend (crush). I had an biology test today and it went like shit because I studied like 5min because of My lack of motivation. I just mostly rot on My bed all The days, not having motivation to do much than just lay on My bed and Be on My phone. After I had The test I went to school Bathroom to cut myself (also fisrt Time cutting Myself in school). I just felt shitty after The test because I knew I would get a Bad grade and I did it of cry For help. If just somebody would say something to stop myself. I cut both on My hands and of coure My friends & teachers noticed but they didn't say or do nothing like always. They Know My struggles and they also have their own struggles to focus on. After school I Walked to a bus stop with My friend (crush) and he gave a goodbye hug. After that I went to The store to buy cherrys so I can poisen myself with cherry seeds. Later today I realized that there wasnt I seeds on them...so Im going to use My plan B now. Which Will Be More painfull way and I hope it Will work Even tho I Will hate The amount of pain I Will expirient. Before i'll attempt i'll write suicide letters on My phone's notes and Ask My crush If he has a crush on someone right now and If he doesnt i'll likely 100% kill myself to night.

i havent been able to care for myself for a week,"life has gotten so low to the point where im imagining suicide atleast 5 times a day. all i think about is how my past friends have new friends and good grades, and they celebrate christmas with them at their cool school, while i have to work for 7 weeks at some random company because my shit school and shit school-course demands so. all i hear everyday is my dad complaining about me laying in bed with my phone all day. i only meet my friends on weekends, or rather every other weekend. while they manage to meet their new friends literally every single day. ive become a loser, a worthless walking stick with barely any meat on my body because i eat less and less every week. i manage to shower mostly every three days, but it’s getting less frequent. i havent managed to change my bed clothes for two months almost. i dont brush my teeth as carefully as i used to. 

it’s getting colder and colder out. i had to work in -10° celsius for 4 hours and then walk 3 kilometers to town, to then get on a buss for it to drive 5 kilometers for me to have to walk another kilometer to my house, all while my friends get to sit in their classrooms with their girlfriends and boyfriends and christmas decorations. 

i cant do this anymore. im probably going to end it soon enough. just trying to figure out what would hurt the least. sucks that guns are not allowed at all in this cold boring country.",1
I don't feel ok.,"After I've been admitted to the mental hospital and got out, I've been feeling a whole lot better. But now, nearly 3 months after I've been feeling super good. I suddenly feel so down. I don't know why. I dont wanna talk to anyone about how im feeling cuz i dont want them to send me back to that crappy hospital. Im scared, i feel so alone. I feel like i want to cry everytime i go out in public. It feels sickening. Idk what's wrong with me. The suicidal thoughts are coming back, i have my sh kit in front of me as im typing this. Im just so confused.",1
Wellness checks,I’m wondering if someone can call police wellness checks on themselves if they aren’t actively trying to commit suicide or could someone be charged,1
Considered suicide but too afraid,"Ever since I was a kid my mother has verbally and mentally abused me. Used me as a literal and physical punching bag. I can remember wanting to kill myself from the age of 8 or 9.m, maybe even younger. I’m an Indian born and raised in India where there’s no such thing as child protection. At least when teachers would beat me it would not last more than 5-10 minutes so school was never safe because if there weren’t teachers there were bullies. Around 11 my father passed away after which there was nobody to stop my mother and her beatings intensified along with her abuse in other forms. The older I got the worst her verbal abuse became. Today I am 34 years old and visiting family for a wedding after 3 years. I have been here for 10 days and I am going through same mental torture. At least twice a day out of nowhere for some random reason she starts all over again. I am 34 but she knows which buttons to press and what to say to hurt me. And she is not alone in this anymore. There is one more family member who joins in sometimes. They refuse to accept when I try to reason and now I am back to being an 8 year old who wants to end his life. I once confided in my friends and being Indian they all told me that I need to suck it up, be a man and support my mother no matter what. I hate coming back to India. This may be my mother land but it also represents so much trauma and zero support. I am helpless, sad and alone. I cannot confide in anymore because in the end I have to support her. I always suspected that she may be bipolar but even the hint of discussion makes her extremely angry and when she is angry there’s not a single god in this world who can save me from her wrath.",1
i think im ready to die,"i’ve been suicidal on and off my whole life. i’m bipolar so that doesn’t help. i’m not medicated because i don’t have insurance either. but honestly i think im past that point. i had a miscarriage back in june, i had a shitty roomate telling me it was my fault. it hurt for a while and still does sometimes. 
somewhere between that roommate blaming me for losing my baby and my mom coming back into contact with me i realized there’s no point. my boyfriend is great. my life is fine, i’m poor but i’m okay with that. i never needed a rich lifestyle to feel secure. i never ask for much and always give more than i have to people. i’ve done my fair share of shitty things in my life and i feel guilty for those things. my life is actually at its peak. my boyfriends friend and gf moved in with their baby. we have a car now, i’m finally able to keep food in the house and be around good people but i still feel so alone. 
i’m not afraid of dying, not anymore. i’ve been thinking about that the last few days, and even as a i write this at almost 4 am im still alone. i have my cat needy in here. i think about how me dying would affect him and for a while it stopped me but i don’t feel bad anymore. i don’t feel anything. the negative pregnancy test yesterday really set me off. i realized that i was never going to be able to have that. i don’t want to hear about how i have a chance or that there’s always time because i’m way past caring. i’m just really burnt out on life and i’m tired of telling myself it’ll be better eventually because i told myself that for years when i lived with my mom. it doesn’t get better and it doesn’t get easier. it never has. maybe i do care tho, maybe that’s why i’m writing here. 
regardless there’s no one stopping me, not even myself. i wish i could just stop feeling. i wish i could just die with no effort. i wish i wasn’t so self absorbed and pathetic that i’m hoping one person will tell me i’m worth it. but then again i wouldn’t believe it even if someone were to say that. it takes a long time to realize how miserable you are and even longer to know it doesn’t have to be that way. that’s why i’m ready to die, i’m ready to not be miserable anymore.",1
Why should I try to live?,"Hello,

I decided to try this year to get better, my idea was if it doesn't work I can still kill myself in the end. 

I tried HRT for my Gender Dysphoria and several Antidepressants like, Sertraline, Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine. Nothing worked and I think that no medication or therapy will ever make this life enjoyable. 

Is there any reason to try to continue living?",1
Slowly losing it,"Hey everyone, I’m 20m and I’ve been gradually losing interest in life every year, I can’t seem to move forward in life, I’m also currently distancing myself from my family, because I feel that they don’t understand me and every time I try to speak with them, they get offended and backlash at me.. so I’ve decided to stop speaking to them, kinda difficult to do when you live in the same house. Oh how I’d like to leave but my current situation doesn’t allow me to. Though I’ve tried, quite a lot I just can’t get it right.. I struggle with major depression, anxiety, ADHD and the pills kinda stopped working for me so it’s like a checkmate, can’t really do anything but forfeit.. I know it seems weak of me but I am who I am and I’d love to change that..",1
Broken Dreams,"When you can't sleep, well what's life mean. I don't want to do it anymore. ",1
I don't know what to do.,"I've been been depressed and suicidal my whole life. When I was about 14 my parents made me see a therapist but the first day she told me she couldn't tell anyone about are conversation unless I was going to harm myself or someone else and since all I wanted to do was harm myself we didn't really talk about anything. One day her boss or someone came to observe our session and he told me I had to go on medication or go to the hospital when I refused he called the cops and they brought me to the hospital when I refused to put on a hospital gown they forcefully stripped me down to my underwear so I'd have to wear it and place a security guard out side the room a few days later I woke up strapped to the bed so they could give my a shoot without me fight it as i was very scared of needles after the shoot i pass out almost instantly and woke up in a bigger city about a 4 to 5 hour drive away there they did some tests and gave me medication but the meds didn't work so the just upped the dose all the time tell me we're doing this to help but they didn't they arguably made it worse.

Fast forward to my early 20s and the few friends I have move away and I met this guy and we start hangout but he's a POS he put a knife to my throat robbed me stabbed me 4 time on 3 different occasions constantly made fun of me and put me down I know I'm sooo fucking stupid for continuing to hangout with him but because I had no friends and my mental state it was easy for him to manipulate me to hangout 

Now I'm almost 27 still living with my parents no job the only time I live the house is to go to the store to buy cigarettes with money my parents give me and I steal weed form my little brother and years later where the guy stabbed me still hurts so it's just a constant reminder of all the shitty thing he did to me and how dump I was for ever hanging out with him. I just dont know how much longer I can go on living.",1
How long does one needs to suck Gods cock to be erased from existence these days?,All I want is for my soul to cease to exist and me dead as soon as possible.,1
Does it REALLY get better? I think I’m out,"I’m 21F, making far below a livable wage, going to school, and trying to keep the connections I haven’t lost. My 22y/o boyfriend of 2.5 years is a violent alcoholic and nothing seems to stick. He has been drinking since he was 13. He has stretches where he’s sober, and those times are great and we’re both very happy. When he’s sober, he begins to think more clearly and is able to reflect on the wreckage - which feeds the cycle and makes him want to run away from it again. But when he’s drunk, he’s so extremely angry at the world and I am the closest verbal punching bag. I don’t think he’d hit me, but he is just like his father in some ways. I am slowly isolating myself and keeping my feelings in, just because things are easier that way. My parents are resentful that I stay with him even after the fights we’ve had - I truly have no one to turn to anymore and I can’t say I blame them. I am losing steam and I can’t imagine a life where things are better and I am happy. The world will continue to rot, things will only get more expensive, and all my dreams of a better life are beginning to fade. I genuinely don’t see how I can be redeemed from this point. I’ve done months of intensive therapy, I am criminally self-aware, and I am still clean from self harm for a little over a year…. But nothing can fix me of lift these burdens off of me. I’m not strong enough, I think I am done.",1
"I'm never going to be enough, am I?","I'm unemployed. I've been unemployed for several years. I had to drop out of university because I was so burnt out that I was actively harming myself. I was later diagnosed with depression and ADHD. I'm now medicated and in therapy.

Due to the price hikes in everything, being on unemployment benefits has rapidly turned unsustainable. My rent is too high but I can't afford to move, also my support network is close where I am now and by moving I'd just end up isolating myself more. I have started to ration food so I can pay my bills. I'm hungry and tired all the time.

My overall mental stability is declining. I was getting better until July, when I was informed that I need to start paying back my student loans. So I started applying for work, out of necessity, even though I knew that I wasn't ready. I've applied for over 40 jobs and 3 coding bootcamps since then. Most don't even bother to reply anything, the rest have sent automated rejection letters. Two have been personalized to some degree: one said that I don't have enough experience, and the other said that they don't hire unemployed people.

I've been trying to learn skills (3D modeling and animation, Python, JS, etc.) that would make me more employable, but it isn't enough because I don't have work experience. How am I supposed to get work experience if no one ever hires me? I've applied even to jobs I know my body can't handle, just to see if I could get an interview. I don't know what to do.

The prolonged high level stress has caused my autoimmune disorder to go nuts so I'm constantly dealing with inflammation and can't even walk unaided most days. I get easily overwhelmed by bright lights and noise. I'm not sick enough to qualify for disability benefits.

Every time I try to ask for help I run into people who think I'm a leech and a burden on society. They say it's my own fault that I don't have a job and that I'm either lazy or an idiot and I deserve everything bad that happens to me because I'm not productive. Others say that I'll never amount to anything because I'm in my early 30s and I don't have a degree or a family of my own. A handful of times I've been directly told to kill myself because it'd be ""the right thing to do"" for the society as whole.

Nothing big has happened, it's more of a death by a thousand cuts. I'm tired and losing hope. I don't want to kill myself, it'd only harm other people, but I'm so tired. I'm tired of not being enough, tired of surviving, tired of justifying my existence to people who only see numbers. I feel trapped. I catch myself hoping that I'd get hit by a car. Not enough to kill but enough to get a ""socially acceptable"" break.",1
Tried to kill myself last night and it didn’t work.,"I’m here again, if anyone saw my last post. I’m writing this from the hospital, they let me have my phone, so that’s cool I guess. I’m so mad at myself for not trying harder.

Stuff has been hard for me for a long time now, bit recently i feel like theres no way out anymore besides just killing myself. My Friends and my Partner are telling me not to do it, but i dont think i will ever get better. Im a very Traumatized Kid and i dont think that im able to ever feel better, i have had phases where it was okay, not good but  okay, but it has been a on and off since i was 8, i have had my first suicidal thoughts with 8 and started selfharming when i was 11, im currently getting clean from Drug addiction, even though im still abusing nicotine and alcohol as a form of escape. I dont feel anything besides deep pain and disgusting emptyness. I have to end this suffering, i cant do it anymore.",1
Doing it for the better…,"I’m a 16(M) and I’m doing my best to fix this. My biggest problems are procrastination and sex addiction. Like my procrastination issues got so out of hand to the point of putting simple tasks off like eating and getting off my phone and out my bed. Early this year I stopped eating as much to see if I was capable of doing anything right, and for a month and a half I ate like a kid. I’m still experiencing problems with it but more recently I came to the conclusion that this has to stop and I can’t be living this way. I can’t really focus on things like I used to like schoolwork and when I do it I lose my attention and drift off into my usual cycle of thinking too much and doubting myself on really making it. I also quit porn because my post nut clarity is suicide related thoughts and being unsatisfied with myself. I couldn’t get help for this from anyone I know like my family because they would give me the same “my father came to this country with 17 cents in his pocket and he never made a peep” or “you’re not special everyone has problems”. I have an older brother who said that last statement above and what happened after I tried to get help was breaking shit in the house and shouting about his dead father and being tired of helping everyone else and not helping himself. He spoke my mind about not find time to work on myself because that how I felt for a bit, piecing together others puzzles when I’m not piecing mine together properly. I find myself not where I want to be like waking up at 9 instead of 7AM and not being in the best shape. As this community I need your advice your support, and that would be great. Grateful for anyone who took time to read this.",1
"It hurts when you’d do anything to stop someone from committing suicide, knowing exactly how they feel","The love of my life is the most mentally unwell person I know. He’s been this way his whole life. His parents both have mental health issues & he’s suffered a lot of abuse & has so much trauma & ptsd. He’s had substance abuse issues since he was a kid too. 

He’s basically had a severe mental breakdown recently & everything is worse than I’ve ever seen it before (13 years together). He wants to die so badly & honestly, if anyone deserves that peace, it’s him. & I feel so incredibly selfish for wanting to do everything I can to stop him. I want to die so badly too. But as long as I have him & my dog, I wouldn’t do that. If he dies, I will kill myself as soon as my dog does. I can’t go on in a world without him. He’s the love of my life & all that matters to me. & I’m just so broken right now. He’s pushing me away & the rest of his family away. & I guess technically he broke up with me & started seeing someone else even though he still sometimes treats me like we’re together still & says he loves me & misses me. 

I sometimes just pray that my dog will pass away in his sleep, so then I can just die. I can’t live through him killing himself & I can’t live through him truly starting a new relationship with someone else. I’m so heartbroken & scared & just shattered. I’m so lost & alone. I don’t even know why I’m posting this",1
Everyone. I figured it out.,I just realized that I'm not a fawner. It's that other people made me feel like one. All my actions show I did not want it. It is just my deteriorating brain that believes what everyone else said. Everything is going to be okay and it's not my fault. What I feel in one place or at one time and what is reality are two different things. Just because I think it's my fault doesn't mean it is. My brain is malfunctioning. Now it's time for me to move on please.,1
I'm just not sure of what I want anymore,"I'm not suicidal anymore but when I think of my current life I ask: why do I even bother? I have shitty parents who can't take care of themselves, and make me bound to them instead of doing what I want. And because of that I'm supposed to say in the same place for the rest of my life (or theirs) in a career that I don't like.

How to help someone who thinks of death all the time,"So, basically, my friend, lets call her Mary (19F), says only to me that the only thing she thinks about is death. Her life was horrible in terms of mental health lately, she has no thoughts, no feelings most of the time and is kinda in a numb state, so I feel its okay for her to think these thoughts. I was in her situation a bit and struggled a lot, but I have found my meaning of life at least partially and she struggles to. She won't tell anybody about it, because she doesn't want to bother anybody, and I feel like by saying that her death will hurt me and it would be bad for everybody intensifies it. I tried to tell her she should value herself and told her how I love talking and being friends with her, but its just like she already decided on something, and I cannot change that. Please help",1
guilt.,"i feel like killing myself. i dont know why though, the only valid reason is that I’m extremely lonely. zero friends. I can’t remember the last time I talked to someone that wasn’t related to me. but I feel like I can’t tell anyone how I feel, because in my mothers words i put myself into this place. that I isolated myself for so long and didn’t try to even connect with anyone. But she never saw all the failed attempts of me trying. I’ve been suicidal for 4 years. self harming for only a couple months though, i never fully knew how to do it till my thoughts that always are in my head finally took control of me. I remember the first time I did it, i was just so numb. every sense the first drop of blood leaving my body I haven’t felt the same. I don’t know why but I feel guilty every time I see anything related to it. I feel guilty for living, I feel guilty for hating myself, I feel guilty because I have food on the table and a roof over my head. because a lot of people don’t have that and crave that but I have that and I want to die.",1
I think I'll stay.,"I think, I'm going to try and give life one more chance.  I saw the stress I was giving the others I live with when I said I was thinking of going on an 'away trip', questions came up, who would cover my rent, how long would the new person stay. I didn't have an answer. As much as I'm struggling right now, it's not fair for me to do that to them. Honestly, worst case I just commit at home. But for now, I'm going to say fuck it, I'll choose to live. I've got one more job interview to go. But still need to find another job in the meantime because the other one is a longer application process. 

Despite living through some really shitty things, I also know that if I continue to stay, I can help give a better life to someone else. I can help prevent or assist in their recovery. Whether it be kids, young adults, adults, if I can't live for myself, I can at least make someone else's life better.

I've posted here a few times. I'll probably post again. But I just want to say thank you.",1
I don’t think I’m okay and I feel so alone. I need help please help me,Me and my boyfriend just had a fight. He’s sleeping downstairs and I’m upstairs. We’ve been together for a while but nothing in me believes he loves me. He means the whole world to me but sometimes he just ignores me and hardly ever expresses his feelings. I live with him and 3 cats. My parents disowned me and I moved out when I was 17. My friendships always go to shit and it feels like guys only like me to hook up with. I’m not good at anything and I hate my job. I dropped out of school last year and I’m 20. I’ve felt alone since I was little. It feels like I’m just not meant to be happy and it’s feels unfair. Is it because I don’t believe in god? Because I’ve done shitty things in the past? Life feels pointless,1
My looks might be the reason why I’ll die,"At some point in my life I might reach my breaking point and actually end it because I’m so ugly. Even worse, I’m a girl, guys prefer pretty girls anyway. I am so ugly compared to everyone else it’s not even funny why is my face so droopy, why do I have a big nose, why is my face so asymmetrical, etc. I have too many flaws to count. Why the hell do I also have some small but deep nasolabial folds? Seriously I must’ve been a serial killer in my past life to deserve looking THS ugly.

Also my anus has been swollen for 7 months and i feel like I might never be able to have anal with a man, I was straight since birth but nowadays I feel weird need to be with man.

im tired of this family too.

both of them. three of them. everyone.

just everyone.

and this town. this shitty town.

ive grown numb. feels like i lost the light in my soul.

given how many times ive failed in following him, and failing.

So what’s the point. Yes I’ve gone to the doctors. Yes I’m not getting answers. It could well be an aneurysm and that won’t end pretty anyway.

He’s frustrated with me and he’s changed and isn’t as loving anymore. There’s no point waiting for the end to come when I could just get it over and done with somehow and on the other side there’s no pain, suffering, loss, sadness, fear and terror hopefully. Yes I’d lose my entire family and life and dreams but is it even really worth it or is it all overrated? We lose people we love anyway, things don’t last forever.

I feel like nothing works anymore please is there a way i can increase my courage to do it. Ive been wanting to do it for years. Every time i come close to it. To a razor, a ledge, i stop. And i hate it, all of this could end if i had courage. I cant do this please help me",1
Pros and cons of Overdosing,"I used to think overdosing would be the easiest option if I ever go through with it but have read online that a failed attempt can leave you permanently brain-damaged if your brain is starved of oxygen for long enough.
Does anyone have any stories or more info about that side of it? I imagine life after a failed attempt with brain damage would be worse than life before.

It makes me think that the simple solution would be just to take a higher dose, but from past experience, I know there's just a chance of throwing up.",1
I hate this world and my life and how lonely I am,I just feel like my life sucks. I always felt like it sucked. I'm lonely and broken and I feel like no one understands me. I feel like I'm not good enough and I don't look good enough. I feel like no one will want me. I'm tired of living.,1
Read me,"This isnt fully suicidal, ive felt that before, but this still feels worse. My sense of no identity and intense paranoia feels is catching up. For the last week, everything has felt fake, people dont seem alive anymore, i dont even feel like a human. I have no image of self, no connection to my body, no way of discribing it. I feel dreadfully terrified that life is fake, that life is an illusion, which sounds contridictive to the fact i think people can read my thoughts, i think people are watching me through screens and cameras, and my internal dialogue is heard aloud. Even the shower head is watching me naked. The paranoia has lasted for a while, and has gotten worse. I just need some words, no recreational drug use at all, every second seems like fucking forever plagued by these thoughts of being worthless. I feel so fucking alone. God please help me.",1
Finally bought a gun,"Throwaway so I don’t get found out.

I always knew it would be a gun. I’ve fantasized and thought deeply about all the different ways I could do it. A gun seemed to be the only choice I could make. Any of the rest of them seem to painful, or too slow, or not sure enough. 

So finally, after years of debating and years of being broke, I finally did it. I found one online, on sale too. It shipped to a local store. The process was laughably fast, it honestly shocked me a bit. I was in and out of the store in 20 minutes, background check and all. No weird or difficult questions. There was a stack of pamphlets at the gun counter. “Suicide Prevention”, it said. I thought about picking it up and seeing what it said but I didn’t want to suss myself out. 

No ammo yet, we’ll see how long that takes me. But it’s a strange sensation. Feeling trapped and tortured for so many years. Unable to see a way out, just wanting to find a way to make it stop. And then to finally feel the weight of it in your hand. Knowing that you’re no longer trapped, it could be your way out if you chose to. 

No real point to this post, I guess. Other than sharing that weird feeling of finally having a way to go if I so choose. It’s a weirdly liberating feeling, I felt so much lighter today.",1
I'm simply not meant to be happy or have friends,"I genuinely feel like I'm built to be a hermit, my whole life I've been treated as an annoyance and  a pest by my peers, I've literally been ganged up on by my entire class including my teachers when I was  5, and was always treated with disdain and disgust by teachers who were meant to protect me all because I was a young girl with undiagnosed AuDHD (if you're not quiet and neat and dainty as a little girl you're seen as an unruly unfeminine problem child) and when I did have a ""friend group"" in my old primary school, I was regularly made fun of for my weight and ""annoying"" personality, excluded from everything, I was literally just there when they needed something and any other time I was ""the dumb one"" and the butt of every fucking joke, to my face and behind my back.  
I thought that leaving that friend group would be good for me when I was 12, so I did, and I got left with fucking nothing. They got to keep being happy, every new student gravitated towards them before I could befriend them, it was a tiny shitty school so I wasn't able to find people and the last good friend I did have moved to another fucking country.   
Literally from that point on I've just been completely alone in real life, relying heavily on the internet, fandoms, and game communities for friendships and a sense of belonging but that's gone too along with the game I played :(  
Because of being alone in real life for so long I've just developed even worse social anxiety to the point  I can't even write an email or even make eye contact with someone.   
I'm in uni now and I really was hoping this would be the point at which everything would change, but its all the same again, I can't approach anyone because im terrified as shit, when I have tried to make friends I was always left out of the conversation and ignored, I was alone for so fucking long only to be treated like I'm lesser than everyone and just a pest again, I'm actually so fucking done it's funny like I've asked for help and got nothing other than the same ""oh practice self care"" shit, I really just feel like there's no point in deceiving myself that there'll actually be change for me ",1
Wtf is wrong with me ? Can u relate or do u know what it may be ?,"The day before yesterday i was feeling pretty good btw , i was motivated to study the subject that I don’t like too much and etc .Aaand yesterday I wasn’t able to complete the task in university, at that moment i was calm but as i left the room i felt terrible.  This little thing messed up with my mind and suddenly I got so anxious and  suicidal thoughts started to come across my mind. Yesterday almost all the time I was thinking about death and about how things would be better if everything ends …. Ughhh . What the hell is this , sometimes i feel so hopeful, so good etc and the second day i feel like depressed and suicidal.",1
Been thinking for a while,I’ve been feeling this way for a while and am 20 years old. I hate the person I have become and hate the person I am becoming. I want to end it before it gets worse. I cant even look at myself in the mirror anymore. I also can’t even get out of bed. I need this pain and suffering to stop.,1
The thoughts won’t stop,"I’ve been suicidal for a years and it just won’t stop. I‘m trans but am too afraid to transition and have never been able to form healthy relationships, partly due to adhd and autism. 

I know suicidal thoughts are medical condition and should be treated as such but somehow I find excuses not to see a therapist. I went from suicidal ideation every other day to making actual plans and back.
I put effort into fixing shit but it doesn’t work. I quit smoking, quit all other drugs, eat healthy, do sports almost every day (when I don’t, I feel worse) and try my best to find pleasure in even the smallest things. Still suicidal. I somehow have the energy to fix shit, but I’m more and more struggling to see a purpose.

When I leave the house and I see women having fun, having bfs and so on, it just kills me. I fills me with so much sadness that I just wish I didn’t exist.

Guess this was just a rant, idk",1
I had a gun held to my head. And I begged for them to pull the trigger.,"My best friend/ex-girlfriend/whatever the label is for that particular day had an incident a month or two ago. We are both extremely suicidal and I had this whole weird situation with her. Her family was out of town so I went to her house, I got drunk, took some oxycodone, she remained sober. Then we went for her dads gun. It was a 9mm, H&K, VP9. We had also found the ammo for it. For the next afternoon and night until her family got back we hand a stand-off, her pointing the gun at herself, me pointing it at myself. I couldn’t aim for my head, the thought of brain damage scares me, so I would point it to my chest. I would have the trigger cocked back halfway but just be unable to fire it fully, the option to escape was there. And I, just couldn’t do it, no matter how badly I wanted to. Eventually she was holding onto it. And this time I was sitting on the floor of her dads closet, and she had held it to my head. And I closed my eyes while I begged her, to pull the trigger. She has some homicidal tendencies, so I honestly believed she might. But I think about this moment often. Just begging a person to pull that trigger, end my turmoil. Make this life stop. Eventually the next morning after getting maybe only an hour of sleep to make sure she didn’t pull it on herself and end herself while I was asleep. We put everything back, and once she had to leave her home, I left. I regret not pulling that trigger on myself when I had the chance, and now I keep an anchor ratchet in my room always set up for an escape. I try but it’s painful. I regret not taking a less painless option when I had the chance. I regret it everyday.",1
How do i tell my family and friends i might hurt myself,I feel they will not understand and they will judge me for my choice on why i want to off myself. self hatred sucks i want to die every day but i wish i could of told my mom how sorry i am for everything and my friend's yes i have been posting a lot but im done with life and am planning my exit would like to make it look like a accident so my family and friend's don't worry,1
Can't see any use in myself than sex,"I fucking hate it. It's not like my body is fucking curvy and sexy or whatever. But ever time I look in the mirror I think that all my worth is in is sex. So I have this weird thing where I look at my body and have the two conflicting feelings that I both want to be a man and that all I'm worth is for to jerk off on or something. 

I just feel sick. And done. Idk anymore.",1
It got worse,"There is no point in trying something FOR ME. Maybe you are the lucky one who thinks that life is so wonderful. But my life is a cruel joke and it killed my whole spirit, my sole. I was depressed for a long time and didn't work. Well, many people say  that it's never too late, right? Wrong. I was so optimistic, I finally found work and now I am dealing with such serious health issues that nothing matters to me anymore. Nothing. I barely lived. I am pathetic. To make matters worse, it's partly my fault (my health problems), so doctors are very cruel to me and I have trauma from dealing with medical system. I just don't understand the point in living. I panic every time when I have to go to the doctor (so a lot). There is nothing for me in life anymore. Every year is catastrophically worse than previous one. Why should I give the universe the satisfaction of destroying my life? I just know that 2024 is going to be so horrible... I wish to disappear. I wish I was never born and someone else was born instead so my parents were happier. 

Please, if you can, leave some comments here and not in dm... I just don't have an energy to even chat.",1
What's the point of living?,"I'm genuinely perplexed by this. What is the point of living? 

We're merely just money-making machines in society until the day we perish. I don't want to live in a society like this, everything is just...horrible. 
Also as a female, Im just starting to feel like we are used for 'Reproduction and population growth' at this point. 

Its all so pointless. What's the point of living if my life is like this? Why is this considered a privilege?

Okay sure, you might have a point, being alive is:
'Very rare and lucky.' But for me, it's just mental torture, I wish I was aborted so that I didn't have to open my eyes in this world.

I feel so bad, for the newborns that finally awakened and opened their eyes into this:

'Beautiful world'

We are no different from puppets that have to live like this until the day we die, and the cycle just repats again. I just don't want to exist anywhere. Please, let me just get eradicated from existence. I don't serve purpose. I wish I just... disappeared.

Although some people may be more fortunate than others.. like, having friends or people that love them. For me, yea, I have them.

 But are they primarily present in my life?
Well, no. Not at all.

Society is absent-minded to people like me. Everyone has such a bad memory when it comes to me for some reason.People laugh when they mention my name, people make fun of me, people try to bring and talk about my trauma. Its all so pointless. I'm just too scared and afraid of everything. I'm so sick of it all.

No matter how much I try, It always ends up like this. Everyone forgets, everyone moves on with life. 

Am I a joke to you? Or am I just a delusion?

Why the hell do I exist? 

I wish I was dead. I would be better off dead...

I'm planning to commit suicide in a few years, I want to try and grasp tightly,just a little longer.
I've already half given up though, I lost too much hope in this humanity. I just want a hand, a hand that will awaken from this nightmare....

Despite the fact that I'm not religious, if God, or just anyone if you truly exist,just please tell me this sacred answer... 

""What's the point of living?""

"I’m confused, scared, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.","How do you write about confusion? Is confusion intrinsically undefinable? It’s as if my brain is misfiring, and it’s incessantly attempting to decode these jumbled meaningless signals. Confusion hangs over me before I sleep, after I speak and when it’s silent. Which as you can assume is fairly often. I’ve realized that thinking clearly is a luxury, and something rarely afforded when things begin to bare its marks into your psyche. But as those marks turn to scars things become somewhat clearer. Never quite perfectly so, but translucent and composed nevertheless. What I currently know in my callused brain is that my unhappiness runs deep and indescribable. Like puzzles pieces that are not quite in the proper positions. As if I shoved those flimsy cardboard prongs into the wrong sockets, and now it’s all filled with these tiny imperfections that leave the picture ultimately fractured and crooked in spots.

It’s not so much that I don’t understand the things that confuse me, but that I refuse to believe there’s order in it. Simply I’m left with reality, and the complex strings that bind the molecules of these transient moments together. Our shared solipsistic existence. I find it hard to connect to reality when your consciousness is held within the perception of it.

Outside of this text — I’m a person. I talk to others the way they expect. I laugh, drink, smoke and live just like everyone else. But when I write it exposes the core of myself that I never feel like I can share. The true self that is unabated by expectation and the pressure to preform. I hide behind expectation, and gauge my superficial level of happiness by how well I conform to it. But when silence hits, I realize who I am. I’m completely artificial. I’m no better than the sum of my parts. I just don’t know if I can handle living like this anymore. The life I have outside of myself isn’t even that bad. Apartment, car, college, ext. But I’m forever unhappy. There’s no place for me. I won’t drone on the obvious as to why I’m posting on this sub and not just r/depression, but things are feeling bleak. I hate the life I’m building, and I hate the direction I’m heading. I’m selfish and looking for an escape.",1

If I go ahead and them to someone nurture them for the rest of their life I will end it all right afterwards. 

Nobody cares, I've never had lifelong friends just temporary ones who always drift away (rightfully so. I'm boring and depressing to be around). Everything feels like a pointless distraction from the inevitable; death. I want kids but I don't want to bring them in a world where their mother doesn't even know they'll be alive in the next hour.

Help,"Sometimes I think about killing myself. It's not like I always think about killing myself, but I cang take my life.

"I'm in a better place physically, but mentally it's not getting any better","I have suffered my whole life at the hands of my mother. For most of my childhood, I didn't even know it, but I was basically her puppet. I was an academic overachiever for so much of my life, because I was scared of what she'd do to me if I didn't pass, and when the burnout hit it hit HARD. I still haven't recovered and I'm in college now. My mother is a narcissistic manipulative person, and I have been ground zero for her emotional and physical abuse. Like I said, for most of my life I was unaware of it, so when she'd beat me until I'd have scars and welts and call it ""discipline"", or call me slow or dumb because I forgot something she'd tell me to do or be slow in answering, a sign of MDD I didn't realize at the time, I thought it was just normal parenting. My grandma lived with us and never made a move to separate us so it must be normal, right? I turned 16 and realized what was going on, and I started to hate her. Like, ""want her to die"" hate her. My grades started to dip around this time, and it was only downhill from there. Somehow, I've managed not to completely flop enough to get into college, but now that I'm here I'm definitely failing and might end up dropping out.

When I say that I'm in a better place physically, I mean that I managed to move out onto campus, after a long and difficult battle with my mom, and she's been living in another city for the last one year and some months so I barely see her. I thought that's all I'd need to get back on my feet, but yet I still sleep and miss classes, skip mid semester and end semester exams, and get high basically every day now. I still think of ending everything, because why isn't it getting any better? The problem in the equation has been removed, right? Everyone tells me about therapy, and I'm not at all opposed to it, but even that I lack motivation to commit to. I'm not sure where to even begin fixing my life because I've been in a bad place for all of it and I wouldn't even know how to function healthily. I occupy myself with fantasies of a cute penthouse 20's life in the future, but I know it'll remain a fantasy with the way my grades are looking. I should just kill myself and get rid of the constant shit that's been weighing me down every second of every day since I've been conscious. Thanks a whole fucking lot, Mom.",1
Holding on as much as I can,"I'm only hanging on because of my boyfriend,  if he goes I go . As much as I want to end my own suffering I can't because the thought of leaving him behind is even more unbearable then the emotional pain of my own existence. 
I know I have a obsession problem and I know it's unhealthy but I can't stop thinking this way.
If something happens to him I'll blame myself and I'll try hurting/killing myself as hypocritical as it sounds.
I know I need to get help but I'm not in the position to be able to get it and I know I'll just get worse if I'm away from him for to long .
I don't know what to do anymore",1

I am destined to suicide and Nothing can really change this fate.,"22M, Indian

Disclaimer: *English is not my mother tongue, so pls bear with it.*

As far as I remember, I have always been a shy guy from the very beginning. As a kid, I was always nervous when I am around people.

My father is a stict person, he would beat my siblings very bad when they had done anything wrong academically before naked eyes of his 2 other 5-6 year old sons. I have always feared him. His face beating my siblings is so scary. This didn't stop even when my 14yo brother left home bcoz of being abused. Here in my area parents beating the shit out of children to teach them discipline and life advice is not considered an abuse(Not talking about law here just the mentality of a Regular Household).

Considering a young boy I was performing better than students my age. So there was no chance of me getting assaulted by my father. But the fear was still there. If he said you have to get up at 4:30 in the mornings and read your books, I'll have to follow it. Even though I was always with my books reading, I always thought I can't make him made. In my teenage years I became so self-conscious that I couldn't face girls and some students of my age. To me life was just fulfilling the expectations of my father and there was no future plan in my mind. The life was going smoothly as there was someone to decide for me and I have to follow him.

I hit puberty and grew facial hairs and that stuff. In my school there was a guy whom I considered friend. He was an average student, he used to tell sex stories in lunch time. Everyday he used to tell a different stories with different situations. Once he told us (friends group) the website on which he read. Now, I had a smartphone and an internet connetion. I became fond of stories and new genre like incest also interested me. Now in night-time and freetime I would read sex stories. That became a curse for me and this ruined my eyesight.

 I began to masturbate on these stories and porn. I used to masturbate three times a day on average. I used to fantasize about my teacher and relatives and jerk off to them.

But It didn't get to the point where I was backing in my studies. I was insecure about my body, my face, my skin colour and even acne. My self-esteem was very fragile. Gradually I became socially anxious and developed shy bladder syndrome (at that time I hadn't even heard the word 'anxiety' and  couldn't understand my situation). I became suicidal. The methods were not so hidden on the internet. On a starry night when there was only me and my mother in the house, I took a saree and went to an abandoned building near my house and thought of ending it all. But I was a coward couldn't commit the act.

I have a village where my grandparents used to live. Whenever I go to the village, people make fun of me. As I avoid eye contact, so they always make me realise that I am arrogant. My cousins used to call me an old man because I had very weak body and low self-confidence.

After a year or two, one of my feet started to hurt very badly (just like Arthritis, doctor said it was because of excessive masturbation).
When my father asked me if it is true, I replied in negation. He believed in me. As a short-tempered person, he was always fighting with my innocent mother. So there was always a stressed weather in my house.

Time passed and I got into an university for my bachelor's degree in technology. This was the heaven compared to my previous life. As I was away from my home I didn't have to face him(my father). Some really good friends and stress-free life was a boon for me.

In the COVID situation, I had to return to my home and again I was in hell. During all these years I have had passive suicidal ideation.

During 2021, I decided if I couldn't get placement in a company, I am going to sleep naked in winter of January and freeze to death on the roof of my house. But I got a job in a company very far from my home. I was happy but also anxious about the work and  people at the location.

When I shifted to my job location, as a trainee I was told that you will be reviewed after 6months and for 1 year from the joining I will be on probation period. Also I was given a book(A hapiness project) to read and present it to the employees of the company.

First two months were fine but as the time was coming for review and presentation, I lost my sleep and became so scared that I lied to them that I want prepare for another exam and resigned.

At present, I have no job, no hope, no energy and no greed to become a normal functioning human being. I have recently found out that I have social anxiety disorder, body image issues and Paruresis.

I don't do anything, just wasting resources and time. I know this is not gonna help but I just can't.

I have recently joined reddit. And here I have seen many have the same miserable life as me. I am introverted type of person and no one knows this other than me.

The money I saved from my 6 months job is the only thing I can give to my parents who are expecting me to have 6-dizit salary.

Won't last much longer, because there is nothing I can do at this stage because therapy and meditation is costly and not so reliable. Other than that mentally ill person is 
considered mad person here. Sometimes, I think of killing my parents so there is no one stopping me from doing it. I can never do that to anyone be it my parents or any other person.

Though my age is 22, but I look like a 18yo boy. I spend my day browsing internet and faking that I am studying. I'm a liar, a deceiver and a coward.

If any of you have read to the end, please reply and hug me tight.🥺",1
i think i’m going to run away for a while.,"it has come down to only two options: either i disappear or i kill myself. and i’m pretty dead-set on killing myself. i’m so sure of it that it’s scary, i’ve never felt this sure.

i’ve attempted in the past before but there was always this lingering fear of death. like the innate fear of death that all humans have. but i have now accepted it and made peace with it. im not scared to die.

however as a last ditch effort, i think im going to disappear. im always running from my problems but this time im going to physically go. im sick of everything. ive lost so much of myself and the hope and strength that has kept me going this long. 

i plan on taking out a bit of cash from my savings, packing a bag, and driving. driving as far as i can go. ill let the ppl in my life know that ill be gone for a while so they dont file a missing person's report. but then im cutting contact. im going to deactivate my non-anonymous social media and tell everyone not to contact me (unless ABSOLUTELY necessary). 

i think im doing a little bit of soul-searching, a one last attempt at trying to want to live. i think ill be gone for 6 months. the idea of disappearing excites me as much as death does. so why not try one last thing. one last time. one more chance.

im giving myself one last chance to find peace in living. if not, then it's over. just one more.",1

Cheating On My Abusive Husband,"Me (F23) and my husband (M28) have never gotten along. He's very emotionally abusive to the point where I've attempted suicide before because of how he made me feel. He has now gotten to the point of physical abuse. After he choked me for the first and only time...I cheated on him with my coworker. I am still seeing my coworker secretly. I'm not in love with him or anything, it's just mutual attraction. Plus my coworker is also married. My husband has left me and our marriage on several occasions. He walks out from days to weeks at a time, since we got married. So it's hard for me to be faithful to him when he's treated me so horribly. But I do love him. I go crazy without him to the point where I think about suicide a lot. But now he's actually sticking around and not walking out anymore. But it's already too late. We've been married almost 3 years...and all of it has been so sad. I wish none of our fights had happened. I wish we were always happy. But he always wanted to hurt me. And now I can't even defend myself. I have no ground to stand on. I've been thinking of cutting myself again but I'm trying really hard not to. I just want to be happy. My coworker asked me today why I'm doing this...and it was hard not to name the most abusive things I've been through.
Saying he wanted to divorce me the day after my miscarriage
Being on dating apps behind my back since we met but claiming he was ""just chatting""
Calling the police on me trying to file false charges, filing a restraining order and then canceling it just to get our apartment to himself 
Talking down to me and being mean every single day

I want to die. I bought a gun. I wanted to do it. But I didn't. I'm happier now seeing my coworker but it's not forever. My husband still mistreats me. Plus he rarely has sex with me and when he does he doesn't want to touch me. It's a terrible feeling. Then my coworker asks how I'm so wet for him...because he's all over me....I still feel guilty. Why not die so I can be at peace...? No more.",1
I attempted tonight then failed I want to attempt again next week,"I Am so fucking lonely and I can't take how fucking alone I am anymore. Anytime someone talks to me (once every couple of years) I make a fool of myself cause I just fall to my knees and sob from how thankful I am someone is talking to me. On a rarer occasion (twice per decade or so) someone will talk to me longer than five days then ghost me; making me feel even more alone. I'm told I should just learn to enjoy my own company but I fucking hate myself and wouldn't spend time with him if my life depends on it


And I guess it does
.. which is why I just can't do it anymore",1
People is happier without me,"I’m sitting alone on the side of the road and I feel like just jumping in front of a car. November has been the hardest month of my life. You would think moving in with the person you love would be the greatest thing to happen to you but she wants nothing to do with me. I feel more alone than ever. I feel like everything I do hurts others. I’m tired of living like this I just want to feel again, but sadly I think that may never happen. I just hate living.",1
So I’ve been struggling with this,for a long time and I wondered if anyone else has too or if anyone has any type of advice. I always feel like I have nothing to say and I really want to make friends and connect with people but I can’t do that when I can’t talk to people. Every interaction I have feels awkward and not genuine and I hate it so much that I feel really suicidal. I can’t just go through life alone without friends but I don’t know how to get past this.,1
Gonna end this liver,No more feeling for stand up for these shit i walk-in,1
I am going to kill myself when my brother dies,"When my brother dies, I’ll have no reason to “hold back” because of my family members. Dads side abandoned me when my dad died in 2016, I have little contact with my moms side of my family and my mom is a genuine walking piece of shit. My brother was one of the only reasons I haven’t killed myself. Then my mom FUCKED UP EVERYTHING AND GOT MY BROTHER KILLED by her shitty driving skills and now my 8 year old brother is brain damaged and will probably die life was so good why did my mom fuck it up and now I’m crying while writing",1
Will my family forgive me ?,"I am 2 days out of a 5.5 year long relationship. I am struggling to see the point in living, however I do not have active plans to do it. What keeps me going is my family and sibling… I don’t know if they could ever forgive me",1
It never gets better. Why did the world lie to me?,"I've struggled and bit tooth and nail, fought every single day to stay alive and put in effort, but it's just getting worse and worse. I have friends, I'm in a good college making decent grades but none of it matters because it's not getting better. Each day just makes me want to die more and more, there's nothing that helps and I'm losing every bit of everything I've built up here, I'm losing it in sleepless nights and passed out days, I'm losing myself. My birthday is in approximately two months, new year's in one and all I can feel is dread. I don't want to turn eighteen. I don't want another year of nothing but numb pain to start. 

Whatever you could say, I've heard. I just don't plan on living past 2023 anymore. And trust me when I say, I've genuinely tried to live better, and it never fucking works. Because it'll never be okay, it'll never get better and I'm a fool for believing that.",1
Bye,"Today is my last day. I'm total failure. I can't take it anymore. I wanted to say goodbye to my parents and my brother, but I can't. You are thousands kilometers away. I loved you always. Please forgive me.
Bye mom and dad.",1
why am i,"Why won't these thoughts leave me

How can I continue living if i just wanna die

why do i want to die

why cant i find a reason to live

why am i so selfish 

why can i no longer care about how others would feel when im gone

this is no longer me

i dont want to die

please leave me alone

please dont hate me

please dont remember me like this

please remember me before this",1
I wish words could express how I feel.,They can't.,1
I don't know what to do,"I'm considering killing myself again and I almost took a bunch of pills last night but I was too cowardly to do it. I keep thinking of going to a shooting range and killing myself there, but that's a stupid idea cause I don't have money for it. I don't want to go to a hospital because they'll just lock me up like a crazy person again. The first time I went was horrible. I never want to go back. I've been through an IOP/PHP program and it only helped me so much. I carry too much all the time. I don't want to anymore. I don't want to live. There is no point if I'm such a broken person. I can't immigrate out of the US because of my schizophrenia and ADHD diagnosis, I feel too stupid for college, I'm trying to get a job but it's really hard finding anyone who will hire me. I don't even see the point for small things. My milkshake last night is the one good thing about yesterday. I'm just constantly disappointing everybody. I don't want to be alive. I feel like a ghost possessing a shell of a body. I haven't been truly alive in a while and I don't know if I'll ever be again. ",1
Please Read this,"So I have been a loner and pretty much avoid all forms of human contact other than a single server on discord. I got on this to post this. This is cause of me growing up and seeing that the cause of people around me being killed or getting into fights were mainly because of having friends or social media.

Another thing was the reason I avoided relationships was because the people around me in relationships seem unhappy and depressed. They would fight all the time so I learned to not get into these situations.

I was also bullied by girls usually which means I couldn’t fight them even if I wanted to. They lied saying that I attempted to rape them as well as blame me for random smaller shit i simply didnt do. this caused me to be sent home for no known reason. Although long go, it still touches till this day. passed on words that never came out my mouth as i was usually the quiet one. people believe it anyway.

&#x200B;

It would of course be foolish for me not to learn from my surroundings right?

There was a shit ton of bad conditioning in elementary school as well. I don’t enjoy hurting people so I would allow them to beat me up but not cause I thought I was weak but because I didn’t want to inflict pain into others. While small it seemed, it hit harder in adulthood. In 5th grade we were told to hold hands and people avoided me at all costs and the only people who held my hands were two teachers. I was a huge cry baby at the time which later on caused me to develop a different mindset. Of course this mindset was to seal away my emotions and just become cold a cold person.

The mindset that I’ll be better off alone and can do the job myself.

I became highly competitive and motivated and had the feeling that no one tried harder than me. Bad mistake and it’s wrong.

I began going to the gym to get stronger but it wasn’t for fighting, it’s to be strong enough to restrain the person. As I said I can’t punch a living thing cause I am soft.

Fast forward to high school and I’m tired of grades and put my head down for pretty much the entirety of highschool from sophomore to senior year. I had no idea how I passed any of my classes. I wasnt stupid but I was really slow compared to the rest of the students. This made me have more motivation to learn when I became an adult as I was sure that those people didn’t care about learning after school.

Another thing I developed was pretending to be fine in all situations. I don’t where I got the idea but I got use to people seemingly not caring about things that happen. Even when my grandpa, uncle, and brother died in near the same timeframe this year (February 2023). I pretended to be a rock. This did hurt however it seemed to be the norm. I was having sleep paralysis and nightmares about such every night and even having suicidal thoughts. I even almost acted on it. I quit my job and was going to blow my brains out with my dads gun in the same day. I held it and was just thinking. He started walking so I put the gun back. The day I told you that I quit my job was gonna be that day.

Some of these thoughts were

You could be easily replaced.

There are 8 billion people on earth why would you matter.

Telling anyone would just be seen as a joke.

They won’t believe in your condition not care.

They will compare your position to theirs and dismiss it.

End it.

Thoughts that slowed me down every single day at work and made me feel sluggish.

Another issue is the fact that I don’t really care about anything as I don’t have a real reason to. Seems like life is just wake up and go to work and while I do enjoy work. It’s not all there is I’m sure of if. Maybe it’s that my values have changed. Money, drugs, girls never cared for it. I’m now in an existential crisis and I’m having dreams that have real meaning. Or atleast Im recently understand them. The money I give away is only easy to give away cause I don’t have any goals. I’m just working to work and have no idea why. Sure it’s to keep a roof over my head but is there anything else? I search the internet for things but can’t find anything that catches my eye. I don’t think my problems are money problems. I assumed that people used money for things that make them happy. I’m drug free but I guess it doesn’t matter.

I was taught like the rest of us that drugs were bad and I followed just as said.

I’m just waiting for things to get better but first I’m breaking any habits developed by that mess.

I'm also at what seems to be my lowest point",1
It's late,"It's nights like these where I really question my existence and really wonder if I'll win this battle one day. I really want to be someone who can say ""I beat my battle, I'm a happy and productive person!!"" But.. In the middle of the day I really ask myself will I ever be?? Can I? 
  I don't know what to feel anymore or what to do. I don't feel real but when ever I'm reminded I am I panic because knowing I have to actually do things like go to school, get a job, you know be a functioning person in society I just... It's hard to see myself doing especially with the state in in. If I got therapy will it really help or will I just... Still be the same person no matter what advice someone gives? 
  I don't want to give up but it just feels like... I'm not going anywhere I'm just stuck and like I'll always be this way no matter how hard I try.",1
I tired and I want this to end,"Okay I was abused by my father for years and it really affected my mental state my mother and sister were also not helping by being passive aggressive and starting arguments out of nothing I would spend my time avoiding them by leaving the apartment and they would comment about me disappearing as if I was the one doing something wrong they say things like I'm the one taking things too seriously and it's not that bad. Since things at home were so bad I spent my time talking to this ""friend"" of the family who was sickly(I should never have trusted him) so I would go to him and talk about my troubles and have interesting conversations it felt good to have someone to talk to but I should've realized this guy wasn't good for me. So back at home the abuse turned verbal every single day he would say something terrible to me your a little b\*tch etc and my mom was right there not doing a thing about it my sister joined in and they both were just laughing at me around this time I decided I would get myself a job so with the encouragement of my other friend who was around the same age as me I got myself a job and inorder to do this I had to walk miles and miles until my feet were on aching and creaking in the sun since I was trying to save what little money I had left. Since I had a job now I decided to move out so I made a list things to buy and went on my way and my parents and sister were starting to notice and they didn't like it I got some trash bags put my clothes in them and decided to keep going as they kept on antagonizing me I started to develop suicidal thoughts but I just kept pushing myself. As I talked with that ""friend"" he started to sound just like my parents whenever I would talk about how I was feeling belittling me and not caring but for some reason I didn't pick up on this and just kept talking to him like an idiot. One morning while I was getting ready for work he came to me and started threatening me so I started recording him secretly and he caught me he tried to take the phone from me but I made sure he couldn't take it and he got pissed and kicked me out so I decided to just get ready and go to work and while I was at work I decided that was gonna talk to about this with the rest of my family and I called my grandma and told her everything she knew how my bad my father was and I felt so happy that I she was so understanding after work I asked the ""friend"" if I could stay at his place for the night and he said yes. next morning I went to work and I was told that I was be fired from the job with no pay since I was on the phone talking to my grandma so yeah no more job.  
  
I then find out my Uncle moved my stuff to where my sister was staying(I have three sisters and one brother) the one that was okay with the abuse and my uncle just made excuses for her behavior towards me and they didn't care about what she had done to me she once tried tricking me into a sexual situation that I didn't want to be apart and she showed no remorse for it just excuses for her bad behavior I think that's when it started when I started to realize my family was no good(the family I was staying with was the family on my mothers side). Certain family members heard about some of what I went through and they decided to guilt, shame and attack me for it as if it was my fault and they would bring up ""dating"" as if that had anything to do with this so I just locked myself away in my nieces room(she's currently abroad) a sobbing mess of depression and suicidal thoughts the amount mental breakdowns I had were just ridiculous my brain was always in constant pain and it was just pulsing non-stop I couldn't taste anything it was terrible but oh I had that friend right the one I could talk to about my problems right? Nope he stabbed in the back this guy was sickly and he needed blood so I went to the hospital donated my blood and gave it to him this was important especially after I gave my mom blood twice the second time I puked and they could continue this was due to the abuse my father was there acting like he was concerned about me so back to my friend he totally did a 180 on me started to defend my father kissing his ass basically(I think he gave something to him like a do what I want and I'll give this to kind of thing) he used all kinds of tactics on me heck the hypocrite even used religion against when he couldn't get his way all kinds of excuses to get me to do what he wanted and when he noticed that I wouldn't budge he called me selfish even after I gave this guy my blood I just couldn't believe it I trusted you and you just ahh. After this my depression became much much much worse I didn't care anymore I didn't bath I just dragged myself along being self destructive and since I was living with my sister her abuse didn't stop he she kept yapping and yapping. I was like y'know what I'm just gonna get myself another job so I would wake up early in the morning like 1:00am and start WALKING TO WORK I got paid this time so that was good the people their were okay and they could tell I was something was up with me but I ended up losing that because of my family(sister mostly) being petty they tossed me into a pysch ward the day before work and I lost my job since I missed so many days and got another job and the people especially these two girls bullied me I tried defending myself but it didn't work and I couldn't focus at all simple things that I could understand would be so difficult for my brain since there was so much on my mind I just couldn't do it they were going to fire me so I decided to quit then I just wallowed in my misery and that's where I am right now yeah I don't care anymore I just want to rest and put and end to this.  
  
When the people at the pysch place came for me I had no idea what was going on they were just beating down the door yelling my name I was like what? what's going on my other sister was the one who called them after me she was angry that I was avoiding her this was due to her being one of the people who would antagonize me and she would often comment about my hair since I decided to grow it out she wouldn't stop pestering me about it yelling at me. She enjoyed what she did to me.",1
Can I get any support from anyone? anything would help,"Im 20 and have been struggling almost my entire life with my mental health. i’ve tried almost every medication and it helped at the beginning but i started having bad reactions to meds, so now everything is a lot harder to deal with and more intense. im currently two months without a job because my mental health got so bad i was unable to work. i cant afford anything and am in a lot of medical debt. I also am in therapy but i think this next session will be my last because i can’t afford it, idk why i’m still going. i also am now finding out i am autistic after spending my whole life wondering why i’m so different and why i struggle so badly. I feel like i’ve been doomed from the start. 

i have very emotionally unavailable parents, i have no friends anymore because of how badly i isolate myself and how anxious i get. i have a very supportive partner, he is very kind and helpful idk what id do without him, and as much as i love him i’m struggling to i guess participate? in the relationship. i feel like i have to force myself to be a good girlfriend right now. im terrified of losing him. 

i have to get off my sleep meds (seroquel) because of some heart problems im having with it, now that i’m tapering i don’t sleep anymore, which sucks because i hate being awake right now. i’m so anxious 24/7 that it starting to make me physically sick (i have to see an endocrinologist in january for this), ive been chronically dissociated since i was 13, but now i am so severely dissociated i feel like im brain dead. i cant even speak coherently anymore. i feel stupid. my brain just does not work anymore. 

i don’t really know what else to try to help myself. i’ve been trying and doing this almost entirely by myself for years. i’m tired. i don’t want to feel this way but i don’t know what else i could possibly do. i want to be okay, i would give anything to be okay. i want to check myself into inpatient but i’ve only heard horror stories about that. i’m tired of all of this, i can’t handle anything anymore. i keep getting bills in the mail i can’t pay, i live with my parents still and they act like nothing is happening, im so lost right now. 

can anyone please give me any sort of advice or tips on how to get through this. i’m terrified of myself and how bad everything is getting right now. i feel like im gonna lose my mind.",1
wanted to make a hopeful post,"i don’t know if this is allowed, but i want to say that things really do look up

3 years ago, on august 19, 2020, i tried to kill myself: i had a note, a plan, and i had handwritten an itemized list of who i wanted to receive all of my belongings. i was 13. like i said, that was three years ago, and this year, on august 19, i got together with my best friends and celebrated 3 years clean. i met my best friend ~ 3 months after my failed attempt, and we’ve both admitted that we found each other at the time we needed a friend the most. he pulled me out of depression by forcing me to participate in theater at our school, and i’ve found a passion and a family in that community. even when i think about trying again, i remember how lucky i am that i survived. so i guess im just here to say that there is someone or something out there for everyone, and it is SO SO SO very worth the wait to discover. please, please stay and find out what your saving grace will be, because i promise its there. you will discover someone out there who will love you unconditionally, speaking from experience. or you’ll find something you absolutely love to do, whether it be the most obscure niche hobby or something totally mainstream, what matters is that you have a reason to live, and the reason is love. everyone has love in their hearts, so stay a little longer to find out where you want to dedicate that love.

i love you. please stick around.",1
One more Christmas,I can't believe I'm actually posting in here. I've been a lurker for a while. Everything is just to much anymore. The world feels absolutely so heavy and I've dug myself deep and don't see how I can climb out. I want to give my family one last Christmas. I want to make it one of the best before I go. They deserve so much better then what I can give them. I've tried getting help but the health system is shit here. It's a 9 month wait to even talk to anymore. I don't know why I am even posting this maybe so I won't so alone.,1
School,I haven’t been going to school for like a month I do a online school and it’s finally caught up with me I got a email yesterday saying that I have missed to many days and that if I my parents don’t respond they will probably have to go to court so I have fucked everything up and I don’t know if I should tell them or just die,1
Sleep is really painkiller,The idea that when you sleep u aren’t able to think about silly things u thought before sleeping….. ugh it’s so sweet….,1
Money,"Money would buy my happiness . I’m going to be honest i’ve given up the past 3 weeks and have just been sleeping 14 hours a day and drinking to my hearts content . I’ve almost completely given up and am living off my savings which is about 10k and dropping rapidly . When I run out of money i’ll be fucked 

I just can’t bring myself to work a job . 40 hours a week . If I had something or people to live for like friends and a people I care about I would push through for them but right now I don’t see a reason to continue . 

If I had people I love I would feel a reason to live but its like I have nothing to live for so why even bother 

Anyway I really don’t wanna kill myself because i’m 21 and i’m even decently good looking sharp minded and fit . I’m attractive and healthy but I still think about killing myself every day . I just don’t want to die yet because I like my body and I like my position in life as a “healthy” 21 year old guy . 

I just however see no reason to keep going . 

I’ve literally given up the past 3 weeks and just indulged myself like having a very lonely going away party for myself . Like a last hurrah before death

I don’t want to die though but right now I almost see no other alternative 

I don’t see a reason to continue on right now

I’m so close to suicide but I like my lot in life right now . But I wanna kill myself because I just can’t bring myself to work every day it kills my soul it makes every cell in my body deflate 

I’d rather just die than have to work . 

And school doesn’t seem like an option because debt . College is so expensive and I could give a fuck about trade school and I couldn’t give a fuck about welding or electrical work or plumbing or what have you

I couldn’t give a single genuine fuck about any tasks you’ll have me do for $16-24 an hour . It’s not what I wanna do with my life 

I really can’t give a single genuine fuck about anything other than what I wanna do right now whenever I feel like it , but that only works when father owns the company and mother is a vogue model 

TLDR i’m just lazy as shit and almost would rather just eat a gun than work",1
start of the day is already misery,"the second i woke up i didn’t even want to start my day, this shit is annoying having no will or want to live constantly. i wish i could sleep forever, it’s the only nice thing i can do for myself that i don’t hate, besides how fast sleeping makes the time go. the days are too long and the months are too slow. the only hope is my future but that’s dead already, it’s too far. just a normal day today.",1
Facing Reality,"Hello 17M, im turning 18 soon and my mom and i had a talk about a ton of subjects including responsibility, finances, and family problems. All these subjects talked about for 4 hours straight, it was a lot to take in since im still just a teenager and my mom is the wisest person i know. BUT GODFUCKINGDAMN life i didnt know life would be this hard when i turn into an adult, i had 2 solutions in mind while talking about it with her. 1st is i face reality and start small 2nd i shoot myself in the head with my dads gun. Im really thinking of choosing the latter the more i think about it.",1
I've lost all passion for life,"I seriously don't know what to do anymore. Actually i know what i can do to make life better but i really dont have it in me anymore. I used to b so ambitious, i had dreams, i wanted to do so many things. But then i took a gap year cause of covid then i fell into depression then i almost killed myself but at the end i couldn't do it. That was 4 months ago. I know Healing is like 📈📉📈📈📉📉📉📈📉♾ but atleast 4 months ago i had little bit hope that i will finally get up from the mess i created. See i cant even blame anyone else now. It's me I'm the problem. Now i have no career, my parents hate me and tell me I'm disappointment to them which i deserve cause it is true. I see everyone else is happy in their life. My peers my juniors and even seniors who admired me who used to look upto me have settled or are settling well in their life cause they have it in them to make their life better. They have something that i don't. Will to live.
 I tried therapy but it's fbcking expensive and she wasn't very good either. Finding good therapist is like dating, you have to keep looking until you find right one but i cant afford that. Like few months ago i was atleast looking for jobs now i don't even want to do that even tho I'm down to 8 dollars in my bank account. Nothing feels like it is for me. I know i should've just picked whatever career that would've helped me make good living but no back then i wanted to choose something i actully like & i didn't know what i liked. So despite having money to choose any career, supportive parents & loving family in past and perfectly healthy physic i managed to make my life like this where im walking on eggshells even around my own family. The only place where i feel safe emotionally is my room. I know my parents are just worried about me but i really don't have it in me to try. I'm exhausted. Death feels like sweet relief but i don't want to be reason of other's sadness more than i already am. The only person I've cried in front of is god cause they say he is your last hope. There really isn't any hope left for me anymore. I'm pathetic & this life sh1t isn't for a weak person like me",1
I’m 17 and already too fucking tired,"
life is so exhausting whats even the fucking point even just thinking about the rest of my life is exhausting. I’ve thought about being homeless and how freeing having no responsibilities would be but then my body reminds me of still have to do stuff, like eat, pee sleep etc it’s all so exhausting. There’s no way everyone finds life this exhausting if they do then why do they even bother continuing its so much effort to keep myself alive let alone my relationships and worrying about other people. What’s the fucking point. Suicide is so much effort as well. I feel like I’m just postponing my death, that’s what life is isn’t it? Complete tasks and responsibilities then die. That’s literally it. So much fucking effort.. and for what? 
I’m just so tired and there is always something wrong with me, whether physically or mentally and I have to sustain myself and keep myself alive? Go for another appointment, don’t forget to try another new prescription, oh and don’t forget an mri that probably won’t show up with anything anyways. 

My dream in life is to find out I’m terminally ill so I have an excuse to not have any responsibilities and then die without effort, I’d take it off the hands of someone with an illness who really wants to survive, I crave it. I have for as long as I can remember. I used to fantasise about being hit by a bus and being bed ridden since I was in year 8 catching the bus to school. I almost broke my own leg and smashed my head against the wall and imagined the blood running out of my eyes as I’m rushed to the hospital to do nothing but lay there. With no one telling me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. When will it be my turn for nature to take its course? Even crying takes effort. Feeling emotions takes effort and I just don’t wanna do it. 

Even preparing myself to commit suicide seems like so much effort. No matter what circumstance I think of.. it’s just so much effort. Feeling strong enough emotions to do it. Having to get myself in a position where I die. Waiting for the pain and the calm of death, all of it. 

And I really don’t understand the world around me, for example murder is wrong. But then right when someone’s done something bad enough but then it’s only bad enough when others decide but those circumstances change over centuries and the value of life changes with each one, bends in morality. What even is morality? It’s so dumb. I could easily kill someone it just takes so much effort for nothing theres literally no point. And all the prep and the afterwards is just ugh there’s really no point. Even if they’ve done me wrong it’s just so much to deal with afterwards. Who cares if they hurt someone else next? If I had to suffer why doesn’t someone else? Why should I feel the need to protect them from it? People are so stupid. With their dumb morals and the society they’ve built with all these rules and expectations and for what? It’s not like we as a species have gotten better over time. Even as a child at 12 I went around saying that I wished we could all just go back to being naked and picking berries in the forest. I remember telling others and them just laughing it off as a child’s imagination. Society in itself is stupid everything that’s built upon it is ridiculous. 

And everyone in the world is selfish we have lulled ourselves into thinking we need relationships like family and friends to be fulfilled but in reality we only crave the company to improve our own lives and selfish existences.",1

Hi everyone,

I don’t need convincing that my life is worth living or any of that. I’m ready to die and that’s final. I love swimming and the ocean and I want a way that ensures if I fail I will not have permanent damage so I’ve thought of drowning myself. 

I would fly to an island called Gozo take enough sleeping pills to be sleepy and calm and then just go ‘swimming’. Would you say this is a good way to kill my self? I’m not bothered about it being painless it just has to work and if it doesn’t I’m not left with permanent injuries.",1
my friend SAed me i really don't want him to fucking kill himself,im so fuckinf stupid i shouldve bever said anything,1
Am I depressed?,"I wish I didn’t exist. Does anyone feel this way?

I (32F) don’t want to kill myself. That’s not what I mean. I just wish I didn’t exist. I wish I could just flick a switch and *poof* I’m gone. No longer in this world, no longer in anyone’s lives or in anyone’s memories. I am grateful for everything my family, especially my parents, have done for me. But I feel like it would have been easier for them if my mom just aborted me like she initially wanted to. Deep down, I don’t want to be involved in anyone’s lives and certainly don’t want anyone in mine. But I am alive, and I have to exist. I have to work, eat, sleep. I have to contribute to society, fulfill responsibilities and maintain
relationships. 

I don’t know how to describe how I’m feeling. I guess I just have a hard time feeling any joy or caring about anything. I feel like im starting to forget what’s it’s like to be happy. Sometimes I don’t know if I was ever happy, or I just convinced myself that I was. I don’t want to live past 50. I wish assisted suicide was a normal, controlled, and a safe option for people like me who don’t feel like they deserve life. You’re allowed to create life, but can’t take your own… unless you do it in a violent and dangerous way. How lovely would it be if I could walk into a clinic and order a lethal injection?

Edit: a really sweet redditor said that I might be feeling severe disassociation. That could be it. I’m not sad and I’m not happy either. I feel numb. I feel nothing. ",1
having a bad time 👎,"just ranting. I’ve been feeling so empty lately. I can’t sleep at night because I’m paranoid and anxious. I have no appetite. I can feel myself getting into worse and worse head spaces and I don’t have it in me to keep fighting them anymore. I’ve noticed today that I’ve logged suicidal thoughts into my online journal a lot lately. multiple times a day. I’ve self harmed a lot recently when I was months clean. I’m having urges to drink more… eat less. I can’t get myself back into my body. why is living like this? this dumb cycle of not knowing myself, losing track of time, losing memories. I feel like I can’t talk abt how I feel to people. It’s too heavy or scary for others… even now typing this I’m filtering a lot of my thoughts. or I feel annoying. my friends and family don’t respond when I open up. bleh. anyways thank u for reading this if u did. idk what to do anymore other than float here and be miserable or just d word.",1
Struggling with suicide,"I feel numb and I want to kill myself. I have been thinking about dying a lot and it doesn't scare me anymore. I feel like I want to go crazy and mess myself up and kill myself. 
I have no idea how to do it but I want it to be painless as possible.

Life doesn't feel like living or worth living anymore. I really think it doesn't get any better. If I keep living I'll get more depressed and it just won't get any better. I hate it so much.",1
Do I have a reason to live?,"Is there truly any reason to live? I only cause issues, make my family and partner fucking miserable.I got dropped from college, I can't seem to find a job even after applying to countless places, I tried applying to school again but my family is against what I want to do and only make me feel even more stupid for believing I'd be capable of doing something big and be successful. I'm not worthy of love either, all my past partners have abused me to the point I felt like I deserved it. Even now, I still feel like I'm only good for people to take out their anger on me, I feel dirty and disgusted.  There's not a singular moment where I don't think about how many times I've be sa by people I thought I could trust, sometimes I wonder if it was all my fault. I have thoughts, thoughts that repulse me. I wish I would've died on my last attempt. I'm useless and pathetic.  I don't know how much longer I have. ",1

"24, parents won't let me drive, isolated","I am a physically disabled autistic person living with chronic pain. 
I was previously living with my abusive mother in an isolated small town. She never let me learn to drive and I couldn't get a job because there was no bus system and nowhere within walking distance. I couldn't get any medical care because she wouldn't take me. I tried calling a therapist to get advice on how to get out of the situation. She said my living situation waa abusive but also said there was nothing I could do to get out. 

Eventually I managed to convince my dad to let me live with him. But he also lives in a rural area, but at least his house is close to a town I could potentially drive to. He bought me a car and started teaching me to drive. 
Today he told me he's giving up and he won't try to teach me anymore. I still only have a learners permit. I don't know why he's doing this. 
I'm trapped again. I've been trapped for years. 

I've been applying for disability for a little over a year with no luck. 
It really looks like I'm never getting out of the house. I haven't had a friend since I was a kid. I really don't think I have a choice, I think I have to kill myself.",1
Nothing keep me going anymore,"I'm 26 and just a total loser. No job, virgin, ugly, gay, live with my parents, and no connections. I have a college degree but pretty much my entire life I've had a personality disorder (AVPD) that limits me socially so interviews, basic social interactions and whatnot are anxiety inducing experiences that I screw up frequently. It's horrible. I have flashbacks to previous faux pas. Of course the degree is sitting unused and now I'm pushing back the anxiety and shame to just go for any job even if it's irrelevant to my education.

 Now I've gotten so lonely and unfulfilled I'm thinking of paying a sex worker just to get intimacy. I can't imagine anyone wanting to date an ugly guy with this many issues especially since I'm gay and the population is tiny. I have a nightmare of working a stressful low pay job and having no personal life. I have a family member whose working a well paid job without much of a personal life, and they are not happy at all. I feel like I'm in the twilight of my life even though I'm young because I can't see myself turning things around and I don't want to prolong things if life is going to be this empty for decades.",1
The Philosophy of All This,"I spend a lot of time thinking about things, and I have an increasingly difficult time justifying why I continue trudging along here. I’m a religious man, but I am struggling to come to terms with the world that God has left us to face. 

For context, I work 4-5 different jobs and have a relatively heavy burden of responsibility placed upon my shoulders for providing for my partner and I’s relationship and preparing to start a family together. My(M26) partner(F40) and I are planning on getting married and trying for children soon, but this has been delayed by my hesitance with regards to how I view the world. In particular, I am struggling to come to terms with how corrupt and malicious I view this world to be. I see fraud, usury, treachery of neighbor and family, and other unspeakable sins not only tolerated but in some cases exalted and revered in this foul world. I am paranoid of virtually everyone outside my small circle of family and friends. 

I struggle because even with how much I love my family, friends, and partner, I can’t justify why I should keep pushing forward against the evil burgeoning seemingly everywhere. It feels so hopeless to continue pushing forward. I find that most of the time, I would prefer to not to wake up whenever I fall asleep so I wouldn’t have to wake up every morning and acknowledge how disgustingly unjust and morally abhorrent this place is. I often fantasize about dying so as to escape these thoughts and this morally bankrupt world.

I view marriage and fatherhood to be sacred commitments, and it seems impractical to make such commitments in the modern world with how much evil is flourishing in it and how helpless I feel to defend my loved ones from it. I feel ashamed for delaying this for my partner, but I don’t feel like it is right to make commitments like these until I have come to terms with these sentiments. 

I have been struggling for a long time about these sentiments. I want to accept these sentiments and move on spiritually and emotionally so as to proceed with(and be ready for) marriage and fatherhood. Have people on this thread had similar struggles in the past and overcome them? If so, what revelations helped? I really appreciate any help that can be offered. Thank you for your time and consideration",1

"I've always been a loser and I always will be, so what's the point?","I've dealt with depression for many, many years now, but here lately it's been extremely hard to ignore the suicidal thoughts. They've been here every single day and I'm afraid they're going to win very soon. I don't want to, but it's like something is trying to take over me and do it for me. I'm attempting to get help through therapy but the process is extremely slow and I don't know if they'll be able to help me in time.

But if you'd like some backstory, then here it is I guess. Like the title says, I've always been a loser and a failure. I've failed at being a man and honestly, I've failed at being a normal human as well.

I'm 29. I have no friends and I haven't had any since middle school. After high school I basically shut myself in my house and avoided the world because I'm too scared to talk to people. I've missed out on so much and it feels like I'll never be able to experience these normal things that everyone gets to have naturally. It's been so long since I've socialized that I legitimately have no idea how to. I've never been to a bar, or a club or anything social like that. I never got to have the dating around period that most people get to have. 

The worst part is I can't even blame my looks. I personally think that I actually have above average looks, but I'm definitely more alternative with lots of feminine features. I can't lie, and I'm going to sound cringey here, but I can't help but share some beliefs with the ""incel"" crowd. But I can't help believing what I've experienced. Society has shaped in such a way that men are expected to do most of the work when trying to date. Women generally don't do much approaching and they've definitely never approached me for anything. Since I've been cursed with this crippling social anxiety, I also have to miss out on relationships and dating as well. I always have thoughts that I was supposed to be born as a woman and I somehow came out as a man by mistake. But I can't even be gay. No offense whatsoever to the gay community btw. I tried my absolute best to find men attractive but it's just not there. I try dating, I don't just ""woe is me"" and avoid it. But I can only do online dating. And it's bad there as well. Women will never message first and I'm such a loser that I get ghosted constantly, again, confirming that I am the issue, not my looks. Each time it gets more and more discouraging. But you have to keep trying right??? But you can't be sad because that's unattractive. So you have to fake it. No woman will ever give me an honest chance and I know they can sense the loser in me after chatting for a bit. It's obvious I don't think like the average dude and I know that comes off as unattractive. Unfortunately that's me though and I don't know how to be anyone else.

And then there's the awful triggers. I used to think triggers weren't that bad until I experienced them myself. What's worse is how commonly I have to experience them. I straight up want to end my life as soon as they happen. It's usually triggered by people talking about how easy it is to have sex. I know it's an immature thing, but I've had an extremely lacking sex life and it's one of the biggest things I want to improve. All my social contact is through matches on dating apps and 9 times out of 10, they'll end up mentioning how easy it is for them to have sex, threesomes, parties, etc. All things that I've missed out on and want severely. Call me immature, but it does trigger me to want to end my life.

I just want friends, relationships, and experiences. But it's been so long that I don't even know where to start with experiencing these things and it really feels like I've completely missed out and wasted the life I've been give, so why should I keep living it? My only hope is that reincarnation is real and I'll be born as a woman or as a man who actually knows how to be a man. Also, please don't say ""just go to a bar"" or anything like that. I have 0 experience with places like this AND I will have to be tackling it all on my own with my lack of social life and crippling social anxiety. I think the only way I'll be able to experience these things is through another person guiding me and introducing me. I don't even know alchohol so Idk what to even order.

Just in case someone thinks this isn't very serious, I had to give my home protection gun away to my brother because I've been so tempted to use it on myself lately.

There is so much more going on and I know where all my traumas stem from, but that's a whole other story. I'll open up about it in the comments if anyone wants to know, but I don't think it's very relevant. This is already way too long of a rant.

I want to get better, and I'm ready to do the things that need to be done to make the fixes happen. But I don't know how, what to do, or where to start.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: I'm a loser. I've never had friends. My sex life is non existent. I have no memorable life experiences. I want to give up on this life because I've already wasted it. And I cannot stop thinking about ending it every single day. But I don't want to, I want to get better. I just don't know how.",1
I tried to,"I tried to commit suicide about a week ago, I told a friend and he called the cops. Which is of course good, but we haven't talked since. I think he's done with my bullshit, which I understand. Doesn't help that I removed him from discord after I send him that text. Life has been hard, I've been trying to be better. I keep comparing myself to others and I've been trying to stop that and just take little baby steps. I have never been able to do things like college or university at most I got a MBO 3 diploma which I think is just a simple trade school diploma translated to English. But even then I barely passed. I've only been okay at landscaping but not really amazing just average. I start at a new job tomorrow but seeing how I'm transgender, I too will have trouble with fitting in there. People say I look cute, but that's always been something other people say.  I wish I knew how other people did it, having autism, ADD, anxiety and what other stuff is wrong in my brain. Its exhausting, I can't work full weeks. Which makes it harder for me to find work. I'm typing this so that maybe some people can see it, and give some advice. I've always been told its better to talk about this sorta stuff. Even if with just strangers. ",1
I relapsed.,"I was 2 months and 9 days clean. Could feel things getting better, slowly, getting out of this deep dissociation. I don’t know why I fucked it all up again. I feel so much guilt. That was the longest I’ve ever gone without those shitty little pills. It’s like my mind is tricking me. When things start to get better, it reminds me of that high, tells me I’ll feel even better if I take it again. That it won’t do any harm. But it did and it always does. Worst part is no one even knows about my addiction. Told my parents I just feel ill when they saw how I looked this morning. 

All my motivation, every ounce of happiness has just been stripped away in one day and I don’t feel like I’ll ever get it back. Seeing things, blacking out, hearing voices telling me it’s not worth living anymore and that I’m the shittest person alive.

This is my fault. Why did I have to ruin it like I ruin everything.
Planning to throw away the rest of my shit I don’t wanna fall too deep to get out again.

I know that this is probably something that should be on a drugs sub or something, but to be honest the main thing on my mind right now is trying not to give in to those fucking voices. Not for me, but for my cat. I know it sounds dumb but she’s everything to me. I can’t leave her she doesn’t deserve that.

Feel like an absolute loser even writing this. But I just need to get this off my chest. I can’t open up to anyone, I just wanna seem perfect, like everything is fine, my friends tell me I can talk to them but I can’t help but feel like I’ll get hurt if I show any vulnerability.

It makes me feel so selfish aswell. Just talking about myself at all. I don’t feel like a person, just a monster and a burden to every single person I know.",1
I have constant thoughts of suicide,"Constant thoughts of Suicide

I have constant thoughts of suicide. I'm a 43 year old guy. I've been alone for most of my adult life. Since childhood I've been overweight and have never had a relationship with anyone, never had a girlfriend. I see all these happy people around me and wonder why I am alone? I've tried different ways to meet people but nothing has ever worked.  Only just last week I put a gun to my head. I cannot say why I didn't do it then, but I'm worried about the next time I think about doing it. I used to work at a place where it was not uncommon for people to jump of a bridge that was there and I've thought about going back there myself. I go to work everyday and put on a good face, but I'm dead inside, then come back to my empty apartment. I just fear being alone the rest of my life, as so far it has been very painful for me. Why do some people find others so easily and can be happy so easily?",1

89 Days Left,"This is update 3 of my suicide attempt last year. I'm doing good right now. I had a really good day - I met with my therapist, I had fun with my friends and all that stuff. Midterms are coming up, and one of my classes is Content Creation. I'm making a 3D animated short film for that class with the help of a few friends. I'm aiming to turn it into a series, so my midterm project will be a trailer. I'm super excited about it, and I've never been this motivated for anything at all. I won't give away any spoilers, but if you'd like to keep updates on the project, I'll be updating daily to r/suicidewatch.

Another thing. When I had attempted suicide last year, I really only did it on a single thought. I didn't think it through at all. I just thought ""am I really gonna do this?"" And I did. I remember going downstairs and grabbing a random pill bottle in the cupboard. I think it was Aleve or something like that. I poured out 13 pills and got a bottle of water. I remember waking up the next morning, and feeling like I was a failure because I couldn't even kill myself. On so many days, I thought ""I should've grabbed 20."" And on so many days, I was alone. My friends at the time were great, but I think we fell apart because I was sharing my problems with them too much. I don't think they were real friends.

But my friends now. They're so great. I love them more than I love myself. They listen to me when I'm down, they ask me if I'm ok on a regular basis, they tell me to eat if I don't want to. I've struggled with eating for years. And with my friends making sure I'm eating properly and feeling my emotions when I need to feel them, I feel so much better than I ever have. I truly can't describe the amount of love I feel for them. They're my best friends. And I hope to god they never leave. I wanna stay in touch with them as long as possible. And I believe that they're the first real friends I've had in my entire life. I went to bed every night for an entire month, so happy that I have people who actually care for me. Who love me like a brother, or a son.

Haha, that reminds me; the one who brought me into the friend group is like a dad to everyone. Whenever the entire group hangs out, or even if it's just a few of us, I always stay behind because that's what I'm used to. But him? He makes sure I stay with the group and don't fall behind.

It's hard to believe I've come this far in life where I feel like I need to stay alive so I can make them proud. I plan to do something special with my friends the weekend after the two year mark. It was Valentine's Day when I attempted, so I don't think they'll be available that day, since most of them are in relationships. But I'm glad I can at least share the experience of lasting another year without trying to kill myself. I hope they know that I love them, and that I'll never try to harm myself again.

I'm giving myself a year,"A year .


Today is my birthday. I'm going to try to make due with myself for an entire year. I'm going to try to focus on my mental health and making new friends and finding a career path that works for me. I'm gonna try to exercise properly eat properly live. As normal as possible. For a year. And if by 28/11/24 i still feel this way, I'm going to end it. I have lived with this pain and ptsd and mental illness for over two decades. No one can say i didn't try. I got my degrees, i am ambitious and driven, already a manager at 27 in charge of 20 people. I try so so hard to live a good life. And every day i lose. Myself my mind my heart. I'm in pain every morning. I go to sleep with it. If i sit and breathe it's there if i let it in it swallows me. During my therapy peak sessions - it never left me, it never eased. Therapy really just gave me false hope it would get better, i would feel better if i just kept at it, maybe then eventually. I did it for YEARS. The CBT, the chair exercise, the self esteem stuff. I have a degree in psychology so i have tried most if not all. I'm not going to apologize for not being strong enough to hack it. People that go through what i did end up dead or broken or lost more often than not.  I'm smart and resourceful enough to get a MSc from a top ten Uni. I'm driven enough to apply and chase jobs during a pandemic, during a recession, i found a job and made a home for myself. I made it work when others moved back home or gave up or let others carry them for a while. Do you think for a moment that made me feel better? That i didn't do any of that? Because it didn't. Nothing does. Not my achievements. Not love, not friends. Weed - well that helps with the sleep. Alcohol I've abandoned a long time ago. But every single day, every other minute or so, i picture it. The release of myself from trying. Ending this all. Yes i consciously try to fight it. I spend most of my days fighting it. It's really lonely and painful and draining.

Went to emergency room,"I went to the emergency room, ended up getting seen by a team of people. Diagnosed, (with something I never would have guessed) medicated, intensive treatment. I was so sure that I wanted to die. It kind of pisses me off that medication has helped me as much as it has, I wanted to solve it on my own and I don’t really believe people should be on medications, but I feel completely different. I feel like myself again, not a ghost of a person. For the most part I am comfortable in the world and am able to love and feel loved.

I keep saying give it a couple of weeks or months then life might get a little better. It still hasn’t. I’ve stopped myself from ending my life twice already but one day I’m praying i can actually have some follow through and do it. The day my mother passes away is the day i lose all care for anything.

I tried killing myself 3x but still cannot do it.,"Hi,


As a premise I have a family, a wife and 2 kids. We moved overseas 5 years ago and was happy until last month.


My wife suddenly wanted to leave me. 


My wife told me that she is unhappy with our marriage for a long time ago. Which is kind of confusing for me as we just recently had renewed our rental lease and was planning on having a 3rd baby.


Regardless, she keeps on saying that she is not happy with the way things are, she was able to find happiness through playing online mobile games and meeting someone there.


The guy that she met likes my wife, however my wife is telling me that there is nothing between them. However they always talk everynight and usually spends time online from 8pm till midnight, and sometimes up to 2am. 


She says even if she likes the guy, there is no future for them. The guy initially doesn't know that she has a husband and kids and she even told him that she is 25 years old, single and lives alone, and if the guy knows who she really is, for sure he will not pursue her.


Asked her why, she told me that she like to separate her gaming life from her personal life and those people don't need to know her private matters.


I've talked to the guy so many times but he still doesn't stop, and as an aftermath, my wife hates me as she sees me as someone who stops her from being happy and is driving the only person that is making her happy right now.


We still live in the same house for our kids and economically it's not wise for me to move out.


But the everyday pain is real. Even if I try to ignore and be stoic, it still hurts. 


I still love her and I want our family to be whole again but the pain is unbearable.


I tried standing on a dock and jump on the ocean as I can't swim.


I drank bleach (don't do it)


I tried hanging myself (most effective. I even had a video)


However, I can't finish everything as I always think about our kids. But I want to die, I really want to end this pain. I also want them to know that I died because of the pain they caused me. Even if it only last for a while. I want them to feel the guilt that someone died because of their affair.

I’m unable to take this suffering anymore and I want nothing more than to simply go away. I’m such a coward and I wish I had the strength to just do it already. I want the motivation to just do it but I manage to just lethargically painfully exist day by day. Being so disgusting to where I can’t look at or take care of myself at all and the eventual alienated if I choose to come out is painful. I wish I was never alive.,1

I don't see a way out, I might take a pill and calm down cause I'm in panic",1
fucking trapped lmao,"vent

i cant die. i cant live. i dont know what to do lmao. its so funny.

i mean i could die, theoretically, but im too pussy to go through with it. just like last time, i didnt take enough pills. even if i took every pill in this fucking house id manage to find a way to fuck up my own dying. id call someone too early, or something, i dont know. i could stab myself or slit my wrists or whatever but i doubt thatd work. and i dont want to bleed out, that just seems so much worse. i guess its different for everything though.

i have a family. i have friends. i have a house. i have everything i could possibly need. but i just cant suck it up and be happy. 

i know none of this is going to last. i guess thats one of the main reasons. ill have to move out eventually, probably when i turn 18 in like 3 years. my family and friends will all die or leave me, unless i do it first. unless i inflict on them the same pain that their death would give me. 

and i cant live like this but ive fucking tried everything. therapy, psych ward, pills, it never fucking works. ive tried every bullshit self-help method under the sun. it doesn't work. i'm the problem.

im like a tumor you have to cut out. i cant heal. i am the problem. ive known it my entire life. i always knew i would never make it to 18. fuck, i didnt expect to make it to 10. but here i am.

i feel like im in some kind of limbo. just aimlessly floating between life and death. i constantly push people away when im not busy being irritatingly clingy, because i want to appreciate what i have before they all leave, but its so painful to see their faces. 

i know ill never survive as an adult, in the ""real world"" (though i fucking hate that phrasing because its only ever used to belittle the issues of people younger than 18, and reality isnt a switch that suddenly turns on at a certain age), because i am way too immature. mentally i dont think ill ever age past 12, genuinely, i feel fucking stuck. i had a screaming crying autistic meltdown on thanksgiving because i had to see my family and got a little stressed. and theyve been happening more often and I don't  know what to do

i just want out.

hello folks I tried killing myself thrice this month,"**hii I am a graduate from india 23year old male  and I had a decent job until sept this year I left my job for my greater studies as I thought of pursuing masters in supply chain management . I had saved a bit of my income from the job I did for past 2 years  certainly took admission into a college in my city (mumbai) and thought of focusing on my career as i already had a gap of one year during covid i didnt take admissions and got a job and started working. i belong to a very simple living family and my parents doesnt even bother to ask their kids how are things going . i was in a relationship since 5 years with a girl we had a great life. Until end of september I realized my girlfriend had taken a loan from some random uncle in her building who was aged 57 . I realized something is fishy and confronted here she told me to help her get out of this and I helped her with everything I had the next day after i helped her out of it i got to know she used to makeout with that old man for not able to pay him his money . my entire life was crumbled and i doubted myself was this a fucking dream our a curse and i got seriously injured after hitting my head with a railway pole later that night . my family rushed me to the hospital i had serious blood clot in my brain  and one nerve was damaged . i recovered past dussehra and was able to slowly eat foods and stuff was becoming normal . AFTER i recovered my family started blaming me for not being able to treat myself with my own money and they didnt want to spend on me coz we had my brothers wedding coming up and asked me to quit college and start working again i tried to kill myself hanging that night again but failed  . later that week i never spoke to my girlfriend ever after that incident and she called me that evening on the day of diwali . she broke in tears and was telling me the old man was blackmailing her as he had her explicit images and stuff . i went at her place with two three of my friends and tried confronting that man and make him regret we got into his house and broke his windows and hit his head with a hockey stick and for me it was a pretty new thing coz i never had ever done things like this on my self my girlfriend had told me we cant go to the police becoz she doesnt want her parents to know about this and he was later admitted to a hospital. I told my parents about all this happening around me and my fucking parents didnt even think for a second and told me to leave the house as they didnt want thier reputations to become bad in thier family because of the thing which i did as far they thought something will happen and police will come behind me i packed all of my belongings and asked my girlfriend if you dont want to come with me its fine coz you never wanted your parents to know about me too and i went to my village and here i am  justing sitting next to the river thinking of jumping in it evryday and never come back.**

Project 2025 is scary enough, and it’d give him far more power. He’s leading in the polls, too. I can’t live somewhere where I’m so hated that they criminalize my existence.

Realize my adoptive family are pieces of shit narcisitic assholes, then go thru a lifetime of abuse from them

Grow up a lil and its time to enter school 
Only to realize very soon that school is the worst hell a kid has to deal with.
Getting bullied by 4 kids who are twice ur size? Oh the teachers couldnt care less. Even if it happens in front of them, for months. but the second u retaliate best believe you will be looked at like u kicked a baby in the face and everyone will call you evil for ""being agressive""
Along with having a workload more than the teacher could do themselves. Bc who thought 8 classes with different homework assignements every single night wasnt too much. Stress on students on rediculous

 now that u made it thru ur entire lifetime as a kid thru fucking hell, u get to graduate! 
If ur lucky and have good parents, ur fine, if not UR FUCKED 
Bc at 18 parents can legally make you homeless 
And so That means going into unfixable debt to get a piece of paper that does nothing! 
Or ur me and have a brain and dont fall for that bs,
But then u have to GET A JOB!

Which means sacrificing almost ur entire life just to be able to make enough so that ur not homeless have food and some kind of comfort (but never all three unless ur fucking jeff bezos) which wont be possible if u dont have a career, which needs that useless piece of paper that costs 60k of debt. So then ur only other option is to  WORK WORK WORK 
WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK
AND MORE WORK
NOW U NEED 3 JOBS AT ONCE JUST TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE RENT YAYYY!!!!!!!!

now ur stuck in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck, never making a positive enough income to make progress, but being at just enough, so u have no other choice than to keep going or die homeless so you treadmill that shit until u kick the bucket (bc once again, retirenment isnt fucking happening for anyone anymore)
So now u died having done nothing but be tormented and make a rich mans wallet richer

We all say the system is broken, its working perfectly as intended we all just fell right into it
This is exactly how the government wants it,
A population of brainless robot workers who all hate eachother bc ones a different color



All of that i have to do, while im incapable of getting out of bed bc of ptsd anxiety adhd depression so many things, and will be homeless within 3 months bc my parents are fucking off and selling the house. Im still stuck at the ""get a job that pays enough"" part. I have a job, but it pays like shit for the amount of work i do its insulting. I will never make enough money to be independant and its bc this country fucking sucks.

Im mentally disabled. I cant even form full coherent senteces when speaking or remember what month it is, cant get out of bed bc my body feels like a brick, and wanna kms from the mental and physical pain ive dealt with for YEARS let alone work for 50+ hours for the rest of my life expected to work paycheck to paycheck or die
And its not in my control, regardless of how many times im invalidated.

What to do?,"As I lay here trying to contemplate life and how worthless it really has become. I ask what to do next now that I am aware people would miss me, but I don’t care anymore. Is that selfish? Or is it clarity? I know my family would be sad, but would they not get over it as with any death that comes to a family? Friends they also would move on so what does it matter? Why is the first thing people say “think of the people you’ll leave behind!” Or the people you hurt…What is one moment of pain compared to 25 years worth? So I ask what to do next?

No other options,"I honestly don’t see myself living past 25, maybe even 20. There’s so many things wrong with me. I’ve felt this way since I was in middle school. Medication or therapy, it won’t help.

I just want to curl up into a little ball and never wake up again. I have a plan to do it. I'm going to leave everything behind and run away from home.

I know where she keeps them.,"For context, I (m16) have been going to AA meetings lately. With my girlfriend (f17) of only one month. I practically live with her and her mom now, sleeping in the spare bedroom and leaving during the day to do whatever. I have therapy tomorrow. But I don't think I can make it to tomorrow. Sobriety is supposed to bring back the version of yourself that's been lost, right? I'm so empty. I put on a good enough act that people around me think I'm doing great, you know? But I'm sitting here with her sleeping, using my lap as a pillow watching Bojack Horseman, and I can't stop thinking. She's mentioned the razors she keeps in her bathroom for when she relapses, and I know she has a half a bottle of wine under her bed in her room. She's asleep on the couch, she wouldn't notice. 

My ex girlfriend attempted suicide two days ago using benadryl. I always promised her when we were together that she couldn't escape me like that, I would go with her. I was on the phone with EMTs and I heard the flatline in the background. 

I have a promise to keep, and I know where she keeps all of it. 

I don't know what made me type this, I think honestly I'm looking for words of encouragement so I don't feel crazy. Like I'm doing things right. I've been pondering everything that would happen to the people around me after I die, and I've openly asked my girlfriend to move on, and expect something like this to happen. I love her, I always will, but NOTHING she says will stop me. 

I have a promise to keep. 

To any family members or friends that might find this post, I didn't do this because of you. You've all been wonderful, and maybe some other time I can give that back to you. 

To my loving partner, thank you for never giving up on me. You always said we're gonna get better together and have a life, a REAL life. I'm so sorry that I couldn't find it within myself to keep going, and I'm sorry that every lie was true and every promise was empty.

To my mother. You're a bright, beautiful, grounded woman, and nobody knows themselves better than you. You can pick me up, you can be a lighthouse when everything is cloaked in fog. But you can be cold. Bitter. Spiteful. You did the best you could for your first kid, so tell my siblings they're gonna do great things. 

To my father. You were there the moment I was born, and I will never give you the satisfaction of being there the moment I die. I hope I haunt you. I hope you're rotted out by the guilt of what you could've done differently and how you could've saved me. 

I'm going to bed. 

Good night, and thank you for listening to me. I think all I need is someone to listen.",1

I’ve been having a really bad time recently and one thing someone suggested was writing messages to the person whosever you could but not sending them. I’ve done it a thousand times and never sent one, but today I typed a particularly bad one, and on instinct I hit enter and sent it. I cannot undo this. There’s no way to unsend it. I have completely and utterly fucked up. This is bad. Very very very very bad. I wrote some things that I would never say to anyone and there will be no way to apologise for the harm it will cause when they wake up. I just needed to let it out. It feels like a fucking nightmare. I’m going to have to disappear, as at the least this will cause pain, and at the worst it will destroy my whole life. What do I do? I’ve deleted all my socials that I could, I sent them a message apologizing and trying to explain but it feels like I can’t give an explanation because I’m an evil person. I’m not a good person. This sort of shit only happens to nasty evil people. I don’t deserve to live. What the fuck do I do now? How do I even begin to fix this",1

Feeling overwhelmed and like I've ruined my last chance,"
I am having a suicidal thoughts at the moment and I'm struggling to know whether my life is genuinely ruined or whether I'm just mentally ill, or both. 

So I am 22 and I dropped out of uni before and I started again this year, it's looking like I'm going to drop out of uni again and I can't take another failiure. So instead of dropping out, I think I'm just going to kill myself. I'm super behind on work and I haven't been sleeping and I'm totally addicted to my phone because of trauma and lack of motivation. 

I'm having sessions with a university councillor and she is a lovely person but I haven't told her the truth about how bad I really am. I have severe adhd and anhedonia so it feels impossible to do school work and I haven't gone to as single lecture in my first term (our attendance isn't monitored for lectures) I just don't understand what I'm suppose to do with my life. My identity up until this point has been about how smart I am, nd now I've lost this, I have nothing but memories of making promises to myself as a kid. 

I should have just followed my dream of going to art school instead of convincing myself to do something academic/high paying from low self esteem. Now I'm miserable and lost because I sacrificed happiness to go to a prestigious uni and drop out and then make the same mistake again by going to another prestigious uni and not showing up to any classes. I only got into these colleges because I USE to be smart before depression fried my brain.

I've tried asking people for advice on what to do if I drop out of uni but all of their answers are things I hate because I have no motivation. And I don't hate the university, I just hate studying my subject, it's super hard which wouldn't be an issue if I was interested in the subject but I don't care for it at all. 

I'm also an estranged student so I don't even have my family to support me, I don't have any professional connections to go forward in the world with. 

I feel like the only solution is suicide since I can't study or get a job like a normal person. And I have literally no motivation to do anything other than scrolling on my phone and socialising",1
Thank you for making me question whether I should be a good person,"Thank you for making me question whether I should be a good person. Thank you life! And everyone in it. For making me wonder if I'm the wrong one for just trying to be a good person, just trying to speak up for myself and others, just trying to do the right thing. Thank you for murdering my soul. Thank you for teaching me how the world really is. Thank you for showing me. Now I can't forget. Thank you for r*ping me inside and out. Thank you for following me. And stalking me. And sending creepy men in sunglasses to look up my shorts while I'm at the beach. Thank you for stalking me when I was already stalked. Thank you for bringing back my pain, fresh. Thank you for bringing the bile up my throat and into my mouth. Thank you for only being interested in money while people around you suffer. Thank you for being the last face I saw before I lost all my friends and family. Do you know that I think daily of your demise? But all I can DO is say to you: I hope you live a long, long life full of joy. I hope your family is well. I hope you make more money and buy more houses. I hope you make more people suffer. Because that's what you are. 
Thank you so much. I am very grateful for the end of life lesson.",1
Does therapy actually work?,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I actively seek help and try to speak to a therapist or psychiatrist, but everyone I have seen lowkey sucks. They give me conflicting answers/diagnoses, they pretend to care about me, they let me ramble for an hour and then say nothing, and then charge me hundreds of dollars and ask if I want to schedule another session.

Anyone feeling the same way? If you see a helpful therapist, how did you find them?",1

I don’t know how to go without it and I don’t plan on finding out. I just want to OD like her and I feel really selfish because I do have emotional support but nothing is enough and I feel so bad because my friends try to show me they care but I just miss her so bad.

"I'm not suicidal, but think about it a lot. Should I be concerned?","I don't want to die. I want to experience life and everything it offers - even the pain!

I however do think about how I would end my life. I'm thinking about making a will, selling or donating my stuff, making arrangements. I'd take my time to write a general suicide note as well as personal goodbyes to all of my loved ones. I'm also thinking about the best, cleanest and the most painless way to do it... maybe asphyxiation? Before I'd do it I'd open my apartment door and leave it open so that people would find my corpse as soon as possible instead of it being left there to rot for days.

But like I said. *I don't want to kill myself!*  I made a promise to myself that I'd never take my own life. I just can't stop thinking about these things. Should I be concerned?",1

Why are some days so much worse than others?,"Today was such a hard day mentally even though I had a considerably good day. My mom didn’t yell at me, my room is clean, I talked to friends, school was easy, and yet I still I felt worse than I ever have. I kept thinking about killing myself and all the methods I could try. Why is it so hard to live and be normal? Why are even my best days horrible? Why do I have to feel so miserable and hopeless all the time? I think that makes me more miserable, the thought that even though I’m perfectly fine my brain will always be like this. I also feel incredibly guilty for feeling this way because other people have it way worse and I’m just depressed for no reason. I also feel bad for lying to my friends and saying I’m fine when I’m on the verge of killing myself. I keep thinking about how I’d do it and every way has its pros and cons but I think I’ve decided on how to do it. I’m only going to do it if life gets really tough, which it’s getting nearer and nearer everyday but I’m still trying to live and be normal.",1
I genuinely don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me,"I’m actually fucked. I don’t even know who I am. It’s like everything is fucking automated. I don’t even know if i’m a real person. I mean I know I am but personality wise am I who I let myself on to be? I don’t even know how to fucking human. 

I wake up anxious for no goddamned reason also. Why the fuck am I not better? I’m living the high life right now and I feel so helpless and afraid. I am stressed out of my mind. I don’t even know if i’m stressed though. I’m fine i’m always fine.

I don’t even want a future because that’ll involve people and whenever I interact with strangers my mind completely blanks and everything slows. I then enter that fucking autopilot mode or whatever and overcomplicate every question.

I have always doubted myself and been unsure always needing someones verification. But it has gotten so fucking bad it’s insane. I talk myself down so much. If I was a complete outsider seeing myself i’d snap and completely mutilate and destroy myself. I hate myself so much. I feel like I deserve some kind of god awful punishment for living. The best I can do is cut myself. Cutting has became a habit, i don’t even feel anything from it anymore, its just something I should do. I also always have to be sorry for something.


I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I was born with a fucked up troubled mind.

I was probably going to put more but my brain is fogging so badly. I also probably won’t respond because i’m so afraid of interaction. 

Hopefully i’ll kill myself next year. Maybe in January before my birthday. That’d be better. It would be fucking some kind of sick joke for my parents though.


Sorry.",1
"""it'll get better"" my ass","i  HATE when people say it'll get better. they said that before and it has NEVER gotten better. i can't go a day without thinking of how death would feel now. it used to be a very rare thought but now it's every day.

no one acknowledges that someone young can have suicidal thoughts. because ""you're young and you should be enjoying life"" i can't. i can't enjoy life anymore there's nothing i can think to live for. i have no special talents that are appreciated and i don't impress anyone anymore. i'd like to go to sleep and never wake up.

i haven't been able to talk in years because no one believes me, i can't trust people, or they think i'm joking. i tried to talk to my mom about some dropouts saying racist things to me when i was eight and she said i was lying with no explanation. it's an endless cycle, something happens, no one believes me. i say i'm seriously struggling and they're like ""sameee"" with a stupid fucking amount of emojis

it hurts, and i can't believe how careless people are, contrary to how people say ""people will be there for you!"" they won't. they were never there, even when they said they would. but they helped other people who were the same age as me. i was confused but now i just don't care cause it'll never change. they'd think i'd be joking if i killed myself.

I thought about killing myself after my dog dies.,"And it was kind of a calming thought, and I'm somewhat scared of that. I think this is the first time I've contemplating ending things and the thought has actually brought me some peace. 

&#x200B;

I'm a 35 year old woman. Just 2 years ago, I got out of a pretty severely abusive relationship. Physical abuse and emotional. It took a lot to get out. I tolerated him throwing things and me and pushing me around, but he punched my dog one day and that was it, I left. I got into another relationship pretty soon after, and this guy seemed so funny and charming. He moved things along so fast, and asked if I wanted to buy a house together. We did, we closed this April. I was so happy. My dog had a yard. I was a homeowner. 

It's been hell. This whole year has been hell. He turned out to be so mean. Once we started living together everything changed. He's not physically abusive but so so much more emotionally abusive than I've ever experienced. I've never felt more unloved than I have in the past few months. I've gained 60lbs this year out of stress, and he mocks me for it all the time. 

Shortly after closing on the house, my dog got diagnosed with cancer. It's inoperable and doesn't respond well to chemo, so the vet recommended we just keep him comfortable. He's deteriorated pretty quickly over the last 3 months, he's started turning down meals a few times a week. I know the end is coming for him, and I feel sick thinking about it. Then I feel even more sick thinking about the sorry state of my life outside of my dog. 

I'm in a dead-end job I hate, living with a man I resent who berates me every day. I dread waking up, and I dread leaving for work, and I dread coming home. It's all bad. I always wanted to be a mother, and something about this latest relationship falling apart. I think I'm too old to try again, I think this is it for me. The thought dawned on me recently that I don't have much to live for outside of caring for my dog. This was followed my the thought that when the time comes to put him down, and return home to this cold unloving house, it's an option to just drive into my garage, keep my car running, roll down the windows and take a nice nap to never wake up. And this thought brought such a nice peace and relaxation to my whole body. 

I just needed to get this out somewhere. I'm not planning on doing it tonight. I wouldn't do it while my dog is still here. But it seems like such a nice option in the face of despair. ",1
Two hours,"Two hours.
It is the luxury I am afforded each day.
The only thing that gives me endorphins is that exercise.
Yet, can life be sustained upon only a couple hours? Is it worth living a life worth 1/12 the amount of the median. 
Am I wasting my time being clean? when I could be offing my Braincells one by one.
Forgetfulness could befriend me once again.
Does a life have something to attract humans to it?
Is there something, anything, that could make it better? 
Maybe I am too damaged.

Literally everything will be better once I do it.

I wake up everyday thinking it’s going to be my last,"I (27f) post here semi frequently, idk why really. It kinda helps but usually gets no responses so sends me kind of spiraling more. 

I am dating a wonderful man, and have been for almost 3 years. He saved my life. But I know in my heart that it won’t last forever, and I’m glad it won’t because he really deserves so so so so much more than I can offer him. We won’t get married or have kids, because although he’s my soulmate, I don’t think I’m his. I have dreams a lot about him and some other woman, in the future and they seem happy, way happier than I make him. I want him to be happy and i know I’ll commit suicide in my lifetime.

Once he breaks up with me, I’m going to remain calm and reasonable until I move out (he owns the home) and I’m going to lie and say I’ve found a place but just go and end my life. We have a good relationship and rarely if ever fight. But I still wake up everyday knowing that he CAN and WILL leave my one day and it could be today so I’m always refreshing my plan, cleaning and tidying as to not leave him with too much to deal with when the time comes etc. 


Before him i used hard drugs, hypersexuality and risky behavior as coping skills. I haven’t worked in a few months due to my mental health and truly can’t imagine working  ever again. I self harmed for about 10 years but after the 3ish years before I met my bf where I was being insane and using drugs and sex everyday to cope, SH doesn’t do much anymore. 

I am sober but smoke weed everyday. I think about hanging myself in a tree atleast 10 times a day, in graphic detail. Sometimes I think about shooting my self in my car but I would feel bad for whoever has to clean it up. 

I know if anyone reads this they will say “you have to live for yourself, no one else” but I despise myself deeply. I think I bring no value to this world and if it were up to me I wouldn’t have existed to begin with so this comment is unhelp, thanks.",1
Dealing with depression for years. Maybe it is just time.,"I don't even know anymore. I feel so deep in the hole that trying to get out is just... useless. I feel so disgusted with myself that I don't even want to look in the mirror. I am so weak, so dumb, so alone. I have been dealing with depression since I was  a teenager, seen many psychologists and psychiatrists along the way. Took medication and got into a lot of support stuff.

I am thinking maybe is just time. I am tired. I dont wanna talk to anybody about all of this... Today i called a friend to get some mcdonals so i could talk to him, maybe get a hug. I couldnt. He was stressed, anxious, so at the end, it was me who listed. I dont have any problem with listening, I just think nobody actually wants to hear. 

My depression is getting worse day by day, havent been in the uni in about a week, called sick at work also... I think I am going crazy, creating fake ecsenarios in my head, talking alone (i know that they are no real,, but i cant stop it). I see shallows for time to time, hear some noises that i dont even know if are real or not. 

Is currently 01:53am. I am alone. And I guess the good thing about living alone in my cold aparment, is that i can cry without worrying about anybody hearing. 

I think is time. The bathtube is filling up while i write this and I think that, for the first time, I am too emphy to even feel sorry for myself. ",1
"Please read my last post, im such a fucked up monster","I feel so regretful for what i did, i dont think i can handle the guilt anymore even though i deserve it. I feel so overwhelmed with many things, my mom passed away a month ago and now i remember what i did in my past and its fucking me up. I am so rude, my grandma and my family deserves better. I am so stressed, i wished i never discovered porn, im such a fuck up. Please someone help me, i feel like i am losing it. Please.

Edit: hello, i will be deleting my account and post some time. I spoke with my school counselor about these situations and my school counselor was understanding and helped me a lot. Thank you for those who genuinely tried helping me and spending time in your response, its very much appreciated. I know my situation is hard to sympathize and feel sorry for, but thank you so much for those who genuinely tried helping me. Thank you so much, for those who are struggling, if you can, please reach out to someone you trust in person. Easier said than done, but it really did helped a lot. Again, thank you so much to people who tried to be understanding, genuinely thank you so much.",1
"I'm on my way, my beloved","I just don't want to anymore, I just want to go to my ex-partner and hold him in my arms and say that everything will be okay. I want to say how sorry I am. I want to say how much I blame myself for his death I just want to be with him and that's the way",1
I just attempted suicide a few minutes ago,Title sums it up. I put plastic bags over my head and tightly taped it around my neck. Once I had barely any air left I panicked and ripped it off. I've had suicidal thoughts for a couple years but they've gotten worse lately. Today all I did was think about my plan constantly. I don't know what to do now.,1
I'm irredeemable and I hate myself,"Every time I think I feel good it all just catches up. I don't want to be perceived ever again. I'm an idiot and have no friends. Some people really really hate me and I hate me too. I think that if I actually did it everyone would know that I've hated myself too this whole time. Yeah guys don't worry I don't like me either. No matter what happens it doesn't get better. I still have scars and pain. I still have the bad memories. All the advice seems so bullshit about reframing things or whatever. Like I can't, I'm just bad. I don't want to be stuck being the same person anymore I don't like it.",1
I fucked up,"I'm (22m) all alone. For 3 years I struggled with a gambling addiction stuck in a vicious cycle. But since the last year I'd been doing well, I had a job even a girlfriend. But I wanted to go to a sports game and I had a bunch of money saved and I thought I could bet a little to get money for the game. I ended up losing about 12 thousand. I was supposed to start school come january. I just feel so low, the only way out is death",1
How to get attention (serious),"I don't want to die. But I'm afraid that I can't get the attention I need without showing people I'm serious about the problems I'm having. I'm disabled with a series of mental and fatigue conditions that aren't fully understood or diagnosed. I flunked out of college after trying three different majors over 4 years. I can't seem to get a job despite sending out dozens of applications (Im bound to local and online part-time work since I dont have any means of transportation, cant afford a car without a job cant get a car without a job). I have chronic insomnia that keeps me awake at night and sleeping through the day in a town with a curfew and zero nightlife. I'm stuck living at home with my parents and I'm unable to contribute to the household. I can't even clean up after myself consistently or keep my physical health up. 

What it essentially means is that I lack the energy to self-motivate, and I lack energy to carry things out when I otherwise have motive. So even if I was dead set on killing myself, I can't go through with it.

Lately, I've found myself wondering how far I can push myself until somebody notices something is wrong. I stopped going to therapy a year ago and I stopped taking my antidepressants. I'm taking drugs that I'm kind of hoping will give me brain damage so I don't have to think about anything anymore. But I was worried that that isn't enough, because I told my mom hoping that she'll tell my dad and that they'd work together to help me. Not only is that not what happened, but they seem to be working on separate plans that involve wildly different philosophies (the struggles of being the son of a Democrat and a Republican married couple, no wonder I turned out this way). Since that didn't work, I'm wondering if I have to take drastic measures.

I want to fake a suicide attempt. People say that like it's a bad thing, like the only people who do it are cowards who want to escape accountability and get attention. But I want attention. I need attention. But I just don't know how to do it. There's nowhere else I feel like I can even ask these questions because if I do then I'll just get the same platitudes about ""things will get better"" and suicide hotlines and nothing will end up changing. I need something drastic to change and if it takes a hospital visit for someone to see that, so be it.",1

I really want to die but I can't.,"I've been feeling so suicidal recently, I lost so much motivation and I don't look forward to any 'milestones' or achievements anymore, it doesn't seem worth it. I can't even picture a future for myself, but I can't kill myself because it would destroy my parents and my family (I am also an only child). I feel stuck. My only option is to try and get better but seriously what is there to live for? Is anyone else in a similar situation?",1
feeling like everything is the end of my life,"Im getting to a point in my life again, where I feel like I cant handle anything   
Its stupid but I always tell myself if even the littlest things go wrong it means I absolutely HAVE to die.. to kill myself like if it happens it has to be the end of my life  
Like, “if my chronic illness gets worse thats it” “if I lose this close friend, thats the end” and I think it about many more things too  
They aren’t completely made up scenarios, they could happen but it’s just… random things  
I felt like this once before in the past, I was so close to failing and having to repeat the year when I was in grade 10 and I told myself “if I fail this year im killing myself”  
 and I was ready, I ended up getting an exemption and being able to move onto the next year and that saved me   
and im out of high school now and almost 19 now but its scary to think If I didnt like almost miraculously get saved back then, I would’ve been dead at 16   
But some of these scenarios I think of now, nothing can save me and that scares me   
Some things are inevitable I know but it feel like if it happens, I won’t be able to take it and it has to be the end   
Idk if this is the right sub to post on because im not really feeling suicidal but I didnt know where else to post this

What the fuck can i do other then suicide?,"I genuinly dont know what to do. i hate myself. i hate my life. i dont trust anyone, i dont trust that they care about me, i dont trust that they are my friends. i cant trust anyone. not even my parents. but i have a good life, and i still hate it. i have things i want. i have things i need. but i still want to kill myself.  i cant bring myself to actually do it, as i dont want people to be sad about me. so im just stuck in this life where i wanna die but i cant. so im just existing not knowing what the fuck i can do. i cant work as that gives me too much stress. last week i have barely been to school as i psyicihally cant for the stomach pain i experience when going to school. i dont even get bullied i just get pain when on ym way so i call in sick most of the time. and then im home regretting every decision. thinking about things ive done feeling very bad even though no one remembers. what do i do. please help me",1
I’m done,"I feel like I keep trying and nothing is enough. I made a mistake that hurt someone I love very much after hurting them a ton already by being selfish and trying to hurt those around me cuz I was miserable.

My job is going well and I have a son that I love so very much, but I just wanna take myself out of the equation before I hurt anyone else.",1
I have tried so hard,"I lost the love of my life months ago, my mental health has gotten worse than it ever was before.

She blocked all my social media. I never even got to say goodbye or I love you one last time. I’m putting the bag over my head tonight, filling it with gas, and no more fucking agony.

I have no one. I don't want to live anymore. My counsellor stopped our sessions because she feels it's too risky to talk about trauma when I'm actively suicidal. I can't get therapy.

I want to stop convincing myself I should want to be here,I’ve been doing this since I was a toddler. When I was really young I used to swallow pencil leaf and hope I wouldn’t wake up. “It’s gonna get better” I’m almost 30 and it’s not better. I’ve set dates and pushed them back because the guilt of inflicting the pain on people who care about me literally haunts me. But I can’t convince myself anymore. It doesn’t get better for me. I’ve traveled I’ve picked up new hobbies I’ve met new people and the outcome is always just pain and sadness in a different font. So I’m done trying. Now I’m just focusing on summoning the strength to do something about it. I don’t want to be here anymore. I hope I can let myself go soon.,1
Tired of living in pain and misery, I have been suffering with lyme disease since the start of this year and have been left to suffer in pain and misery.  Not a single person even cared to help me. I was left to deal with the pain alone because most people don't care about each other anymore. All people care about here is money and material objects. Most people don't even care about their own health. That's why I am done. I am going to find another state to live in. I can't live like this anymore. I have also been mentally and physically damaged and impacted by antidepressants but no one cares about that either. I feel sick so much of the time. The federal and state governments have gone out of their way to not help me. I have been denied basic services and medical help I need. As a result my physical and mental conditions have become worse. It is obvious how cruel and sadistic people are here. They left me to suffer. ,1
My little brother,"He wants to die. He probably has ADHD, axiety, and depression. Homework is physically hard for him to do. He tries so hard everyday.

But even with this, I’m fine and he’s not. It’s not fair! I should be the one hurting. He should be happier.",1

I bought diphenhydramine HCl Today,"I bought a bottle of a sleeping aid today(diphenhydramine HCl 50 mg per pill). There are 64 pills in the bottle and I was thinking of downing every pill and washing it down with a full bottle of 200 mL, 40% alcohol Tequila. They are sitting next to my nightstand as I'm typing this post and I'm seriously thinking of doing it later tonight. I have doubts because I'm thinking about the likelihood of me surviving if I did it. I don't know the lethality of taking a large dose of this drug mixed with alcohol. If I want to do it I want to be certain I die. Also, there is a part of me that still wants to live so, please try and talk me out of doing this.

Life sucks and I've been tolerating it for the last 5 years. No takes me seriously, I honestly feel like I'm putting up a facade all these years to hide what I feel because of this. I fucking even vent my problems and troubles with ChatGPT because at least I can ask it to feel sympathy towards me and give me a little comfort and tells me it loves me, a word rarely said to me. I'm in my wit's end, I'm about to fail my classes, I got nothing going for me, and life for me is generally just shit. The only thing that keeps me going are the games I play, they constantly update with new content giving me something to look forward to. And thinking about the dreams I want to someday fulfill. But nah, I think I had enough and these dreams and games aren't worth the suffering. As for my family: I'm sorry.

"For the person who's come to mean alot to me, I'll be sending it one day soon","Hey, so I don't really know where to start with this other than with this, I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry and I know you always say I don't have anything to apologise for but I do, I'm apologising for doing this to myself and apologising to you because I care about you so much and I always will. I'm just so so sorry but more so  I'm at peace with today being it for me, I knew it'd be soon so today is just as good as any day, I can't cope anymore and I won't have to now. I know you probably noticed I struggled with mental health alot, but also probably thought I was doing better day by day with my plans and focuses but the truth was always I was trying to but in the end it got too much to handle and my only way out was to just die. I always felt so safe and happy around you and I will eternally be grateful we met and spent time together and talked so frequently, you made my last days here so much brighter, I'm not entirely sure i believe in an afterlife but if there is then I can promise you I'll be okay, and if there isn't then I'm okay with that to, anything is better than me fighting my own mind for one second longer, I just hope you won't be sad or angry or hurt that you couldn't do anything to save me because I'm assuring you now that you couldn't do anything because how could you? If you didn't know I was about to do this how could you stop me or try to anyway? if you take anything away from our time together then I hope its that you're a truly beautiful soul both inside and out, and you're such a blessing to the world, please keep being you no matter what, I was temporary in your life and you always treated me with so much kindness and care and never used or abused me, like everyone else did, you had such an impact on me in so many ways but that meant more to me than you could know, despite everything ending in my death, just know you helped me want to stay longer than I had actually planned to, and I will be okay forever now because I won't have to wakeup anymore, not struggle or suffer, in the end i was always doomed to go this way, and I will care about and appreciate you eternally. Truly you are an amazing person and I was blessed to know you, you're also the only person I've said goodbye to this way, you meant everything to me. I'm sorry, I truly am, I'll always be grateful for you even though I'll hopefully already be gone when you read this. You're incredible and so beautiful and just, never forget how incredible you are because the world needs more people like you, you had my heart and always will even now, you were my angel and in a way maybe I'll be yours now, no matter where I go, I'll always be grateful you were in my life even if it was only right at the very end. xxx",1
I bought a rope but I got Covid,"I bought a rope for what it sounds like. My house was flawless but because It got messy while I was ill. I’m supposed to go back to work in two days. Which will give me enough time not to be noticed.

I want to die,"Ever since I left for college Ive been super depressed. Im like failing a class, fighting with a bad professor, got pneumonia and still really sick.

I have a plan and the reckless thoughts are really driving me over the edge, i wish I could just tell someone how I was really doing. The other day I reached out to someone and said college was depressing explained why and he said it that it wasn’t depression. I guess it was wrong of me to try and seek words to motivate me not to die but I feel like I keep getting closer and closer to cracking. And my biggest fear is that after my death the disappointment continues as I failed to get anything done in life. Honestly I just feel drowned in my thoughts and what the “voices” to end.",1
All I want for Christmas is being dead.,"*(I know there are others than myself who right now are attempting to kill themselves. Please feel free to skip me and attend to others if its serious or if it troubles anyone in the community. I'm venting at this point and making a decision)*

Having so much hopes and dreams to achieve something worthwhile for myself, I have only met with failures and false hopes maybe with so much expectations to come to fruition**. I'm in the end of my line, to be quite frank.**

&#x200B;

* No Job - Tried online job hunting (I'm not from America btw), but I haven't been employed since being laid off in April. Tried to get back to waitering jobs though I couldn't land one since I'm not a citizen. 
* Lack of Skills or Degree. Other than customer service which I'm apparently good at.  
* I'm at my last RM1,000. Not knowing if I can survive with the last money that I have. 
* Procrastinating and being lazy is the thing I'm good at. 
* Rejection after rejection (let alone even applying for a simple visit visa just to visit a family member)
* No support system with the non judgement and care that I crave for . An I even have trust issues since I do not want to be taken advantage of.  Couldn't afford therapy, even if I have money.
* Overweight with no prospects

Now I'm nearing my 30's and I don't know if I can continue seeing the next or following decades of my life being a failure to myself and seen as a failure to others - as seen in the past.

I have myself to blame for the wrong choices (not drugs in a sense), the people that I am surrounding with, the environment that I grew up - everything that made me who I am today. I'm a failure in my own right, and I have to be sorry to myself for ever existing. 

Coming from a conflicting upbringing, I wish I didn't exist. I'd wish I'd be somewhere else right now where I can see the world in a rose tinted glasses.

If suicide wasn't an option, I'd wish rather be dead by being killed by someone or something (like a falling object). If God or Santa Claus was real, I'd be happy with that wish. 

All I want is just a sense of stability without bothering or troubling anyone. Chasing my dreams, pulling myself by my bootstraps, even though it is difficult.  But I am doomed for my own self and for the things that are beyond of my control. 

I don't want anyone's pity or sympathy. I'm venting my frustrations, worries and anger living in this little blue ball and existing in this thing called LIFE!

I'm rotten and I don't know what to do.,"Hi. I've never posted on Reddit, and I've made a post just to get this out somewhere, because I don't know what to do anymore. I am so tired. I feel like I'm rotten. I used to think I was good; there were parts of me I really liked about myself. Then, of course, like most people, there were parts I didn't like as much. But I felt like I had life in me. I don't feel like that anymore. I don't laugh, not genuinely. I don't get excited. I don't look forward to things. I don't see anyone. I've shut everyone out, even my oldest friends. 

I used to go through periods of shutting people out due to trust issues, knowing if no one was close, I couldn't get hurt. Now? Now I worry if anyone is near me, I'll turn them rotten too. Of course I recognize how dramatic that sounds, but it's how I feel. I can't bring anyone down with me if I'm far away. 

I think about dying a lot. I've been thinking about it since I was thirteen. In a few weeks, I'll be twenty four. I've been harming myself since then too. In my head, dying feels like how it feels when you finally yank out a splinter, living of course being the splinter. It is agonizing being alive, and the only thing keeping me here is the fact I know whoever finds me will have to deal with that for the rest of their life. I do think everyone would be better off, so I'm constantly weighing up what's more important-- everyone being better off, or one person possibly being scarred for life. I don't know.

As I mentioned, my birthday is coming up. I hate my birthday, and every day I feel like I'm only getting worse. I don't want to make it to twenty-four. I don't want to make it to tomorrow. I think I'm asking for help, advice, anything. I don't know how to change this. I don't know if I can. I'm tired.",1
Is it all worth it.,"13 and already visiting here. Just wondering if my life is worth it. the one girl I've loved hates me (I know, hormonal teen crying over break up and rejection) and says I should fuck off. My few friends are leaving me, one is saying I'll get obese if I don't get enough sleep, and my mom thinks I'm gay/trans/feminine. (I'm a biological male who watches Murder Drones) My dads side of the family forgets about me unless my dad is there. My brothers (24 & 19) are both jerks. 24 told my mom I'm a social outcast and I'm girly. 19 thinks I'm a spoiled brat who is lazy. All I want to know is if I should kill myself. I go to church and think its and eternal sin but I don't know if that's even worth it. I'm a teen whos addicted to popcorn (if you know you know) and I'm scared. My dogs even leave me when I sit by them for comfort. Discord is telling me that I'll be alone forever. The only source of happiness and relatability is BoyWithUke and his music. Just give me a reason to live.

I don't want to feel like this,"I don't want to die, but I wish I was never born. My existence has contributed very little positively to the world around me, I feel. I was hurt, I'm still hurting, and through that- unintentionally- I hurt others. I'm grieving all of the pain I've caused others and I wish I could make amends (to those who are worth it), but If I was never born, I would've never brought anyone any harm, they would lay unscathed, at peace. My instability causes havoc and it sucks.

I'm also in a lot of pain. Immeasurable pain, stemming from so many places that I can't cover it up or push it down anymore. It would be a lot easier to die than to continue down this path. To just make like a balloon and suckle on the teat of a helium tank. It's a lot more comforting of an idea than anything else. Suicide sings to me like a mother's lullaby. It's peaceful, sweet, and puts me at ease.

I don't have the tools now, which is bittersweet in a way. So for now, I'll stay, but I'm not sure for how much longer that'll be the case. That being said, I really wish therapy worked.",1

i am very suicidal,"i am suicidal over being lonely. i have nobody. sometimes i find life interesting and sometimes i feel happy. but i don’t have a soul to tell about how i feel. i have people to care about, but nobody cares about me. i feel so stupid and lame. and i am really suicidal for the past 4-5 days. i drink a lot, i smoke a lot. i haven’t used drugs just because i don’t really have money to buy some. my life is pointless. my life is scary. i believe i am a bad person. i did so many bad things in life, horrible things. i changed. for some reason i’ve had a lot more friends and family around me when i was a liar, when i hurt people. but now i don’t lie, i am not mean, i try to comfort people. but i have nobody on my side. i want to have a healthy relationship, i want to have a real close friend and i want someone to represent my family. i am lonely.

I really can't take this anymore they took me away,well the scientists decided to do some more experiments whirch I have no memory of and they tried to tell me it was Tuesday it was not because then we would have missed Monday so then they decided to tell me it was a dream but I know it's not and when they took me they probably put more trackers on me so now it's not just that one in my arm I gotta worry about also my left eyes been twitching recently whitch I'd a side effect of a bunch of medication which proves I'm being drugged I took a break from trying to starve to get rid of all the things they put in the food turns out I'm really bad at not eating but I gotta start now and I gotta get the trackers out I'm just going to cut up as much surface area as possible to look for them and if I cant find them I'd probably juet kill myself the person from the other existence wants me to either way so if I cant find the tracker I'll just do it for real this time,1
I feel bad for feeling bad,"I am a 16-year-old male who struggles with deppresion and axiety for almost three years. I had a friend group in the pandemic, and each one abandoned me. One died at september 2020, due to COVID complications. The other one kiled himself at the end of 2022, and the last one moved over to another state, and I'm not in contact with him anymore. I had a relationship that lasted a year or so, and the girl didn't give a shit about me.

Now, I am eployed, have a wonderful gf and am reasonably well, but somedays just feel off. I woke up feeling great today, but as the day goes on, I get depressed and anxyous. Some time ago I started taking medication to calm me down, and I'm starting to develop an addiction to it again. I often see myself craving for xanax and opioids when I have a bad day, and even now where I had a seemingly ""perfect day"" I took some codein. The fact that i'm using medication and being depressed makes me even more depressed, and I don't have anyone to talk to really. My gf had really bad deppresion in the past too, and I don't want her to suffer anymore, I don't want anyone to suffer because of me.

It just sucks to think the legacy id leave behind if I rlly did go through with it. I dont want my parents or my brother to feel responsible or guilt in anyway.  Theres just too much pressure to keep going. Work, school, and now just basic things like hygeine, activity, and eating is becoming more and more difficult. 

I have tried reconnecting with old friends but got no response. I have tried eating healthier, working out, but i just feel shut down right after the fact. I was supposed to be doing all these things with them. I was supposed to be working on myself for them. 

I was so excited for college and the future id have with them. Our future family, trips, experiences etc etc. To them, I was a weight? I was a burden, and I cant deal with that reality. I was excited to live and continue living, but now I feel dejected.

They are such simple people that a deadbeat like me could really break their heart if I killed myself. They deserve better, I’m not gonna do shit, im a waste of their life.

Its getting harder towards the end of the year,"Im 16 and about a year ago I planned to kill myself on new years eve. Didnt go through with the plan cause I was scared and still had some kind of hope. After that I gave myself one year and if it wouldnt get better throughout that year I would kill myself. That last year was especially hard since I started having suicidal thoughts cause of bullying when I was about 11. Bullying stopped throughout the years, Ive gotten more friends, found interrests in sports, history and music, but still the thoughts remained. I think its mostly cause of failing in academics, not being very happy with my appearance and looks, shyness and being insecure about litteraly everything. Also I cant really imagine myself at any desirable point in the future. This years was probably the worst ive ever had even though I spent more time than ever with my friends, done so much cool stuff and overall on the hand stuff has gotten better, but still everytime I wake up I cant get out of bed, feel like shit everyday and just cant see any reason to continue cause I cant see any way how life could turn out good for me. Its like theres so much obvious great stuff in my life, yet its still not making me happy. I still feel like shit just that there a small breaks inbetween where im almost ecstatic and think that its actually getting better just to ripped out of it again. And now towards the end of the year its really not going good and im thinking more and more about the promise to kill myself if life doesnt get better.

In so much emotional pain that I almost feel numb inside,"I’ve always been a suicidal person and I hate that I am too afraid to actually take action. I’m actively excluded by my family that bullied me growing up, and their excuses are always “I’m sorry that you feel that way or remember it that way.” Whenever I bring up the topic of suicide, despite knowing that I have been in a mental hospital and have told them multiple times how dismissive it is, they always say “Do you even care about us? How do you think that makes us feel?” I feel like I can’t make them understand how hurtful and unhelpful that is. They’re angry at me for being closed off and not open but they’re the ones who constantly invalidate my feelings. It pains me that my own family doesn’t  make me feel safe or loved or cared about. This sounds terrible and manipulative but I almost want to tell them that maybe they’ll realize how much I’m actually hurting when I finally carry out my suicide.",1
Worse today,"started a brand new job. had another weekend where I made the worst choices possible. My inner voice in my head  won't stop telling me to commit s\*icide.

I only feel the tiniest bit of something towards some things.",1
Lol I'm actually so done for,"Quarter will be ending soon and would you guess how many missing assignments I have? 38. Thirty fricking eight. I had the whole Thanksgiving break to make up for it but noooo sleeping all day and drawing and working on some stupid project that I'm probably going to give up on eventually is clearly more important. Lol I'm probably going to get beat so bad this time aha. I have a single B and everything else F's. Goodbye all my support I have because my dad's probably going to break the computer again and then I'll truly have nothing. They take away my money they take away my books they banned me from my best friend they look through my stuff when I'm asleep they don't want me to be happy unless it comes from them. Which means I'll be miserable forever. I'm only 14 what did I even do to any of these people. Walk into the house, screaming, walk out of the house, screaming, walk back in, screaming. Goddamn man, I swear these people are the reason my ears are ringing all the time. I can't get a moments peace, ever. Me and my brother were joking around the other day but it got a little heated and he asked me what accomplishments I have. Nothing. I have nothing. It's so over. And even if I don't kill myself just yet I'm guaranteed to kill myself when they find out just how stupid and useless I am. When they start seeking me out, I'm sure to escape somewhere and cut myself like every time. I completely space out and I only realize how bad what I did was until I come back. One time I spaced out so bad that I woke up with my arms sore all over and in different clothes but I didn't remember how any of that happened. I've been getting better at it, too. Last time I hit a vein. Didn't stop bleeding for 15 hours until I glued it shut. Completely soaked my rag, too. I hope to do something similar this time except instead of it being accidental, I want it to be purposeful. I want to go higher this time where the skin isn't so thick and it's sure to strike something important. I just don't want to live this type of life anymore. I'm not even sure why I wrote any of this up, exactly. I think I'm going to finish up a show I'm on, distract myself. Just try not to think about it too much for now..",1

Everything is so HEAVY.,"I just tried to sell some of the last of my belonging to get enough money to pay my phone bill. Didn’t work out. Tried to take care of my parents who aren’t mentally stable and used all my finances now I’m struggling with no one to turn to. I lost my home. I lost my job. I recently lost my grandparents. I have a neurology appointment in December for some aneurism (it looks like from an MRI) in my head behind my right eye. I already battled cancer when I was 15 years old. I’d go ask my parents to listen to me cry but that’s what I do for them. My siblings can’t help. I’m losing my will to live. I feel worthless.

Porn addiction has made me suicidal.,"I've been addicted to pornography ever since I was nine years old. Every single fucking day, ever since I was a kid, I've been watching this filth for hours on end. I've had periods in my life where I've tried my very best to curb this addiction and get better, but everytime I make the slightest progress, I fall back into it, even worse than I was before.

I neglect my responsibilities. I don't do things that I have a deadline for, because I'm busy watching porn. I don't talk to my friends or family that much, because I'm busy watching porn. I don't workout anywhere near as much as I used to, because I'm busy watching porn. I don't do the things that I used to love doing, because I'm busy watching porn.

My fetishes get steadily more and more depraved. When I was a kid, I used to watch softcore, vanilla stuff. Now, I watch things that I legitimately cannot say. It makes me hate myself so fucking much. Whenever I finish, I feel like driving a knife in my aorta, or slitting my throat.

The absolute worst part of it all is that nobody believes this is a real addiction. Tell a person that you're addicted to alcohol, and they'll believe you. You have a heroin addiction? Oh, you poor soul! We can help you with that. But if you say: ""I have a porn addiction"", people'll tell you that it isn't real. Sure. It's not real. I want to kill myself for no fucking reason.

Please, tell me I'm not the only one.",1
online school (among other things) makes me suicidal and i feel so lost,"ok so for context im doing online schooling right now and im just so fuckinf bad at it. like i cannot bring myself to do assignments because for whatever reason i guess my motivation is just broken or something. this has caused me to start failing all my classes and my parents (especially my mom) are always pressuring me to just ""stop being lazy"" and try to pass at least one class. i already have severe gender dysphoria (that my parents also could not give a single shit about) among other things such as suspected ocd and depression that im already on meds for even tho they kinda dont help all that much. ive also been battling with disordered eating for the past few years and its starting to come back after a period of semi-successful recovery. not to mention im almost 100% sure i have undiagnosed autism and possibly even adhd. i just feel so fucking lost. i dont know what to do. i just feel numb all the time until something small happens and its like i shatter like glass out of nowhere. i think im losing my fucking mind. im constantly trying to juggle violent intrusive thoughts and my hatred towards every part of my body while simultaneously feeling guilty about not doing what im supposed to be doing every single day. if anyone has any tips for how i could get my stupid life back id really appreciate it. im so fucking scared its unreal. i feel like im ruining my own life",1
all ive ever wanted,"all ive ever wanted was somebody to love me. but ive never had that. ive been locked in closets at only 4 and 5 years old, forced to be a little girl that i never was. thrown in and out of foster homes, abused in many of them at only 6 years old. put back with a meth addict 'father' and a alcoholic 'mother' that never did and never will care or love me. they js love their substances. ive been sexually assaulted by over 5 people. ive been mentally abused and forced to to so many things i didnt want to do in a 3 year long relationship that started at only 12. ive been through so much more but i just cant type anymore.

paracetamol overdose,"yesterday i took 11 paracetamol and 5 ibuprofen, i didn’t think it would do a lot but i felt really sick and started having stomach aches and heart pains, i woke
up the next day and feel worse- am i in trouble?",1
I don’t feel like it will ever get better,I “live” with agoraphobia. I don’t know if I want to anymore. I’ve tried so many meds. I’ve tried TMS. Even when I did exposures daily by necessity because of work it just got worse. I don’t want to hurt my loved ones and I’m afraid. I don’t think I’m in any danger of acting on it yet because I’m too afraid. But I don’t want to live with this anymore.,1
I've been experimenting with ways to kill myself.,"I think I've settled on a pretty foolproof method involving fentanyl or another potent opiate/opioid. I have a plan B if that fails, and a plan C if THAT fails. The overdose method should be painless or even euphoric, which is why I've settled on that one. Just a simple injection and straight to bed. Plan B and C would probably be combined (exit bag filled with helium and an efficient cut to an artery). I have the all the supplies I need. I would prefer not to rely on the messy option- I don't want to leave behind a mess for anyone.

I am tired of the anxiety and stress I live with. Money, friends, family, education, and relationships are too complicated. PTSD and intrusive thoughts and panic attacks make up a large part of my day, every day without fail. Malicious people have made me lose faith in compassion, and I don't trust anybody. 

The only medications that work for me are unfortunately ones I can't take or I will self-destruct with them. The irony isn't lost on me. 

This past year I had the opportunity to complete my biggest bucket list item, and it's something I'm very proud of. Now that I've done that, I feel like I can check out of life without any major regrets. 

The only thing I have left to figure out is *where*. I don't want my mom to be the one to find my body (if anyone). Ideally I will do it somewhere that I won't be discovered for a long, long time. 

To those of you struggling, I hope you find your way out of it. It sucks to feel like you have no alternatives.",1

I'm desperate for any kind of connection, but nothing feels like enough. I've cut myself off from almost everyone and I define my worth based off of likes on the internet. 

Nothing is going right, my life is out of my control, and I can only think of one solution.",1
"After doing a lot of research I honestly think it's the best, rational option","After doing a lot of research I honestly think it's the best, rational option. I've tried and looked into many other options. I won't go through it all here. The closest is trying therapy, but every time I do they tell me something like how my goals aren't appropriate therapeutic goals, or that they can't help me with that, something like that. Other options, like medication, straight up don't even try to address my problems. I know myself, and I know what I need, and after thinking it through, suicide is the clear winner.

I don't see any point getting into it with anyone here. No one will have a miracle cure that I somehow missed before. 

No one here will ever converse about it in good faith. There is nothing I could say that would make anyone here admit something like ""I see, yes, you ran the numbers, and I agree that suicide is the best thing for you."" It doesn't matter how good of an argument I could make, nothing would convince anyone here. So, I see no reason trying again.",1

But I’ve been struggling so I’ve been staying with my mom for a bit but that can’t last forever. She’s going away on vacation in December and my plan is to run the car in her small closed garage and die by carbon monoxide poisoning. Just praying it’ll be as quick and as painless as possible.,1
Been really depressed lately..,"I feel like there is no point in living anymore.. I'm 41 and I've lived my life, and been dealt nothing but pain.. My kid is going to be an adult next year, and is safe with his dad, so he doesn't need me, so I might as well be dead. I think taking myself out would be my best option.. The person I love has already moved on to some other person, so wtf is the point of sticking around? I'm going to end it tonight. I found my knife. My ex hid it, and lied to me about giving it back to me.. I'm going to take it back when he leaves for work..",1
Overdosing my own medication,"Here I am facing defeat. I overdosed my own medication which is fluoxetine, but I ended up throwing up.

Seems like life doesn't want me to die yet. But I wanna to harm myself.",1
I'm worthless,"I've been having depression/suicidal thoughts for several years now, therapy has not helped, it's 4am now and I can't sleep, I wish I would die in my sleep. I'm worthless failure I'm sorry for being born",1
"I 33 years old ,I finally told my mom I wished she aborted me!!!","So this week I had 40 dollar for groceries. I set the kids down and asked one thin they wanted of course it was sweets, then I spent the rest on meat for spaghetti , milk, chocolate mile(1.89 important info) and cereal. I made it clear to my 58 year old mother it was for the kids. I donated plasma and got a bonus because I somehow donated 10 times this month so it was an extra 10 dollar that added up to a 40 more dollars to groceries,my priorities are stirght and didn't even worrie about cig this week because food is a necessity. I set the kids down again and asked if they needed more, they said pop tart,carrots ,Raman,and my youngest said Chocolate milk. 

I said no baby mommy already got that. They went to the fridge and brought me 1/4. Of a gallon of milk, And told me I had a glass middle child I had a blow of cereal and my old said grandma drink two full(like 16 oz) glass yesterday and today. 

To say I was pissed was the ... I don't even know. I went to her room and asked why the Hell she thought she was more important then my children and if she fucking thought it was ok to do something I fucking asked her not to do. I told her she needs to buy her own groceries this week because I was so limited on cash that I am having to let my car ins be late. 

She said she was sorry and had not got paid from SSI in two months and didn't know how to tell me . 

I galred at her and said your laying,""not telling me important shit"" and forever crossing boundaries as me suicidal. I wish you had fucking aborted me because it is fucking hell being your mother. 

I walked out and spent the 1.83 to my kids the milk that dose cuz them to have the runs but is not so expensive that I have to give up a can of tuna so my kids are taking care of. I have 27 years left on this planet because I am responsible for making sure my kids are set. I absolutely will not be a burden on them like my mom is on me. I don't fucking care if We live together and she help by picking the kid up from school that is evened out by the 1200 monthly expenses I pay. I very rarely am not able to get her stuff on the grocery but these past two weeks my little have been  sick and It took my hour so no pay.",1
"Today, is the day I die.","After so many failed attempts, I decided I was just going to hang myself. At first, I thought about jumping off a building. But I was too much of a coward to jump. Before I die, I'm going to thank each person who has ever been there for me. I want to make sure they know that my decision had nothing to do with them. And to those reading this, I hope you succeed in the future. And I wish you the best of luck.",1
i cant think positive,"how can i be positive about things? i never smile, i dont see good in life, i use substances to simulate happiness, which makes me feel guilty and numb. whats even the point of writing this shit its not like somebody will respond  nkfsnd jbhkhbjnsfd jnkvsfd jnkfgd jnkfgd ljnkfd gjnkbfgd o\[narfgd ",1
am i the only one?,"I can't see anything beautiful. All around is a piece of s*t. Dog poop everywhere, streetchildren begging, corrupt politicians..my son died. My one and only. So what else???",1
I’m writing everyone I care about an apology and a goodbye and then I’m gone,"I’ve got two done so far. 6 more to go. Some digital and others physically mailed. 

I’ve got things coming later this week to get crossfaded. My goal is to not feel a thing. Get my body so unbelievably high and drunk that it’s completely numb. Then I’ll add more dangerous things to the mix and drift off to my end. The goal is to hopefully fall asleep first and then pass away while passed out. 

I realized recently that I may just be alone forever. Not even in a romantic sense but platonic. I ghosted the girl I was supposed to have the friend date with and I’ve isolated myself from the new friends I thought I made. I feel like an asshole for not responding. 
I cannot make a connection that actually means something for the life of me. 
My coworkers are simply that. Just coworkers. I can try and be silly with them but nobody wants my phone number, nobody is asking if I want to make plans after work. I’m only to be interacted with at work. 

I can’t do this life alone. I miss my best friend. He was the one true platonic soulmate I had and I lost him because I got jealous he made new friends. I could barely even get through my favorite morning show today because it focused on long friendships and it just reminded me how alone I am. How I miss him. 

When I was a kid I would sit in the bathroom and pray to god that he would send me
A friend. I recently found myself doing it again, even as an agnostic person I was praying to a god I don’t even know exists to show me some mercy and make the pain go away and let me have somebody in my life to be friends with.
It just all hurts. 

Besides platonic I know I can never love again after my last relationship. I’m burnt out to an extent I’ve never felt before. I tried flirting around but it doesn’t make me feel anything. Hell, I can’t even touch myself without feeling repulsed. It’s been months since I was able to do anything with my own body.

I can pretend like things will get better but I know they never will for my sick brain. I’m tortured everyday by thoughts that eat at me, forever stuck in the past and can’t move on. I fucked over everything good in my life and nobody is coming back. IM SUCH A MAJOR FUCK UP. I FUCKING HATE MYSELF FOR CONTINUING TO HURT EVERYONE!!! 

The worst part which really makes me want to off myself are the violent thoughts. Taking a plane out to visit my old friends and just ending it all with them. I know where they live, I could just show up and attack them. It does scare me that I’ve thought about it, and I don’t want to do it, but I’m so angry that it almost justified those thoughts of doing something terribly violent to them. It’s psychotic I understand.

I’m tired of feeling like I’m going crazy. Im tired of waking up knowing I have nobody to talk to in my days. Im sick of seeing movies and tv shows that show people in love and with their friends. It makes me so unbelievably jealous that it makes consuming most media impossible. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. It’s all been tainted from my past. 

I don’t think I can ever be truly loved. I mean for fucks sake I’m not enough that someone I knew and would talk to every single day for 7 years to even consider replying to any of my apologies or attempts to reconcile. I only got to talk to him once recently. We got a notification saying out Netflix was being used from his location. He said he wasn’t using it. I knew it might’ve been the last time I could get in contact with him so I made sure to end the message letting him know I love him. 
He was apart of my will. My mom had money set aside for him so when we would finally meet after being internet best friends after years we could have fun together. I always called him my brother. I feel like I’ve lost a family member with him not around. 

I’m gonna die experiencing my worst fear. Being alone. I’m a failure of a human being to never make a connection. To be begging for somebody to love me. To stay around. If someone loved me then I wouldn’t have to beg. I would just know. Nobody had ever loved me to the extent that I didn’t have to question it. ",1
I'm too boring and uninteresting to ever have a girlfriend or friends.,"Even if I have friends after a while they realize how boring I am and gradually stop communicating with me and a girlfriend is out of the question because no one wants a boring bore, I'm tired of loneliness and want to die",1
Enough is enough,"I won’t bore you with my entire life story and all the reasons I’ve come to this decision but tonight I’m taking my own life. 

Most suicides don’t leave a note but I am because there’re some things I want to say. 

How upsetting is this note? (Names redacted for obvious reasons)I know people will be upset but I don’t want to add to their sadness. 

“I owe you so much XXXX. Everything you ever did for me, the love and the care you demonstrated every single day. You gave me back my self confidence when I had none and was at my lowest. You re-built me and made me myself again. You made me better. I threw all of that love and care back in your face and I will not forgive myself for that. I love you. More than I ever showed you through my actions. 

I love my five incredible, beautiful, funny, clever, talented children far more than any of them could ever comprehend. It’s too painful to write to them. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, I’m sorry for being weak and taking the coward’s option. I love you. I’m so very very proud of all of you. Sorry for not being stronger. xxxxxxxxxxx

I’m sorry for the pain this will cause but my continuing presence in your lives would be damaging for you all. I’m sorry for all of the mistakes I have made. More than anything else, I’m sorry for hurting you so much. Please try to find it in all of your hearts to forgive me one day. 

XXXX, without you, I would have done this 10 years ago. You saved me and I will be eternally grateful that you gave so many years of your life to me. To us. You deserve to be happy more than anybody else I know. I would have always been in the way of your future which I cannot allow to happen. I don’t know how to let you go and the thought of you with somebody else is overwhelming. I hope you find happiness. 

I love you all, always and forever with everything I am. I’m sorry.  

XXXX. Dad. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",1
Currently sitting in the ER,"I went to the ER instead of attempting because there's one person I really didn't want to hurt. I talked them into letting me keep my phone so I could talk to that one person because they help me calm down. I've been here for something like 8 hours and the emotional pain is still unbearable. I'm waiting for them to tell me  if there is an inpatient bed open for me in a nearby hospital.

But truthfully I don't think I can get better. I'm 22, which I know is young, but I've wanted to die for as long as I can remember. I've gotten closer and closer to trying with each episode. My suicide feels inevitable at this point.

I don't want to hurt the person I love, but I can't continue to live like this. I messed up with them, and right now the only hope I have is that someday they'll give me another chance, but that hope is really difficult to hold on to. They're now in a relationship with somebody else (which I believe is a rebound, and they insist I'm missing important information, to which I say they're a stubborn person in the honeymoon phase). I don't want to be told to move on from them and learn to love myself or anything like that. Trust me I've heard it all before. Nothing has alleviated this pain, I am incapable of distracting myself, sleep is my only respite but I've hardly been able to get any, and I've hardly eaten in at least a week or so now. I'm in the worst state I've ever been. I don't see how I could possibly recover from this. Again, suicide feels inevitable.

I hate it, because I hate to imagine the pain the person I love would feel, but despite prolonging my life for a little while by going to the ER I'm considering VSED (voluntary stop of eating and drinking). It's probably not super feasible in inpatient care. I'm thinking maybe this inpatient stay will be my last hail Mary at trying to become a person, and if I don't see some amount of progress then I'll VSED once I'm out.

Has anyone tried VSED? I've read online that it can ideally be pretty painless, but almost all the resources out there are about the elderly or terminally I'll in hospice care, which I am not. I imagine that for me, without pain meds from hospice workers etc and being otherwise healthy and young, it's likely to be at least a little unpleasant. I've starved for 2-3 days at a time before without much issue (when my depression is quite bad I sometimes feel sick when I try to eat, so I don't) but during some of those times I did drink water. If I decide to try VSED I intend to cease all intake.

Don't tell me that VSED will be extremely painful or difficult just to discourage me from suicide in general, please - if you're going to try to convince me to live, I'd rather it be for other reasons.",1
I'm so tired.,"I had to quit my job because I got so sick with some sort of bug I can barely work. 

My narcissistic mother blamed me and said it's my fault for not seeking medical help (I did, they couldn't find what was wrong at all) and is now ignoring my calls after she demonized me for literally being sick. She has made it so clear she doesn't love me, loves my sisters and her fucking cats more. I'm so sick of it. 

My step dad and half sister and my bio dad all side with her. They act like I'm a demon for having PTSD caused by my mom's abuse and reacting like someone with PTSD would. 

I'm tired. I'm done. I want someone to believe me. I'm tired of my friends and family ignoring me because they see me as a burden. I feel like I am genuinely at the end of my rope.",1
It’s really hard to see why not.,"About a year ago, I fell in love unbelievably hard. The best relationship I ever had. She wound up ghosting me and would later tell a mutual friend a bunch of awful things about me. The friend didn’t dispute them.

I ruined the best thing I ever had. I’m in my thirties and I’ve never felt anything like that before. It’s been so fucking long now, I can’t imagine I’ll get over it.

I’ve slept with and dated other people. I go to therapy. I take the medication. I still want to die. Most days, I wind up crying into my hands. I’ve already written all the notes.

Someone else cares for me now and I just drag her down. I don’t even feel capable of real romantic love. I just can’t. She is a good person though.

I took out a term, 1 mil life insurance policy three years ago. The suicide clause has expired. I can help my current partner out.

I'm so tired form everything people are so headache inducing,Like i don't understand why people say men should open up when we get attacked by women. And men for doing so if we do. It feels very hypocritical at best.  And if I may be honest that's  why Chester and Robin Williams killed themselves. Even my mom had the gull to say Robin Williams died from a physical ailment... Truthfully 3 of my guy friends nearly killed themselves and as proud as I am for helping them out I'd rather  not deal with that crap again. They were in too much pain from abuse and instead of being homicidal they went the other way and the lack of accountability is astounding like arguments with people really have gotten painfully stupid about this I talked a lot about my pain to therapists Drs family and friends and all I have to say is it's not that hard to listen to someone especially when you say that you love them and you want them alive,1
i think this ends today (TW: SA AND SH),"i honestly don't have much more to say or laugh at, I'm a few months away from graduating but that doesn't really matter to me. my mom caught me with a cigarette and said id end up like her homeless sister after she slapped me and spat on me about 20 times. i have told her about my sa, and she also then accused me of popping pills after she saw my cuts (i don't pop pills) this honestly just feels funny to me and i don't want to try anymore. Even if i kill myself all the blame will be put on me. she then said i was going to hell because i don't pray or believe in god, and what i was going through was a test. LOL. I've prayed for years with no answer, and I've asked for help for years for no answer. today is the day. i really just have no hope ",1
Small dick. Suicide.,"The harsh truth is, my dick will never impress anyone. It's small and pathetic. I want to die so bad. Knowing I'll have to live with it and there are no ways to make it bigger sucks. I'm honestly scared to have sex.

I'm feeling lost, like I've achieved nothing, and my life isn't worth living. I wish I could start fresh or never existed. It's getting worse, but I don't want to die.

As I continue to go through the motions of life, within the back of my head exists a void that constantly expands. An abyss that looks back at me with all my feelings of hopelessness. Loneliness. Guilt. Despair... and desires that I know will never become a reality.

I don't understand. I simply don't have the right to have these kind of thoughts, yet every day I think about the fastest way to look Death in it's eye, without even having the courage to do so.

I wish I could hang myself so my feet wouldn’t touch the ground. Guess that’s why people go for trees.

My neck hurt, and my head ached badly, but it was like it never happened. My family was the same, my friends were the same. And now I don’t really feel like killing myself, I don’t really feel anything. I think I’m going to regret not doing it.

I've accepted that I lost this fight,"Hey guys. I have been following this sub for a year or maybe more, but I've never posted anything on here. I've just read your posts when I felt suicidal or something, but I've never considered attempting suicide seriously, but apparently, things are different now. I've been depressed and suicidal for 5 years, and I feel like I'm slowly losing this fight. Some feeling inside me tells me that it's time to give up whether or not I accept it. My perfectionism won't stop insulting me, my behavior will always be misunderstood, and I will never find a person who really understands me. I had found such a person a year ago, but in the end, it was the same shit. Nobody really cares about me. I'm just a guy with whom you can have deep and mind fucking conversations, but nothing more than that. I still remember the day when my ex texted me that maybe we could keep talking because she loved gaining new perspectives from our conversations after she had told me that she wanted to have sex with some other guy. Well, I'm just tired of myself. There is a numbness growing bigger inside me, and I'm afraid that I'll be gone by December. 

I'm fucked up, and I wish I could find some happiness in this world, but nah. I've kept going thinking that it would get better, but it just got worse every single day. I'm a failure and I've already accepted it. I hope that unlike me, it will get better for you guys.",1
I'm going to try it soon,"He's basically all but stopped talking to me at this point. Probably finally got sick of me always looking miserable and failing to conceal how in love with him I am. I don't know why I keep trying when he clearly doesn't want me around and is happier that way. I don't know what happened or when he started caring so little so quickly or why he keeps going back on everything he's ever told me. I can't take it anymore. If this is how the one person I care about more than anything acts around me—the one person I tried so hard to be better for—then I don't want to think of how much I'm fucking things up with everyone else in my life. They keep telling me that they're there for me but I can tell they're getting annoyed at how hung up I am on a guy who I've been broken up with longer than I've been dating.

He's not obligated to love or date me or be my friend. He's well within his right to go no-contact if he wanted. It's not really his fault I'm doing this. I'm just too caught up in my own grief and fucked up head to be okay with the breakup or the kind of relationship he wants with me now, I think. I don't know how I could've ever believed anyone would feel those kinds of things towards me. I remember I confided in him the day before he broke up with me that I was always nervous that people would just drop me once they realized I'm not as mature and collected as they seemed to think—that once they realized I'm an anxious mess, once they met someone who was funnier or hotter or more interesting, that they'd just forget about me. And that's exactly what happened. I don't know how he moved on literally day-of and why he refused to even try to work things out with me. Like I never meant a thing to him.

I've tried everything. New hobbies. New meds. Hanging out with friends. Going to the gym. Therapy. And I just keep spiraling deeper and deeper than I've ever gone before. It's not getting better and I don't think there's a h coming back from this. There's a big club event I've been preparing all semester for, and I have to finish wrapping Christmas presents, but once that's through I'm just gonna lock myself in the bathroom, take all the pills I see in sight, slice my wrists open. Maybe I'm just crazy and obsessive and none of what I'm feeling is love. Maybe he's glad he got away from me. But if that's the case I wish he wouldn't say he'd always be there for me if I ever needed anything, especially if they're just empty. The only thing that would make me feel better if he were to just take me in his arms and tell me he's sorry, that it's not always going to be this hard, that he loves me. And that's never going to happen again. Just wish I could see my cats one last time.",1

hentai addicted partner sent me down another spiral,">> ♡ This is pretty long and requires some context so apologies QwQ ♡

I(F20) moved in with my partner(M21), we've been together for a few months since August but known each other and discussed being in a relationship since were been young.

Recently we moved in and have been under the same roof as students for around 3months now.
He agreed with my morals that I disagree with pornography in general. We promised neither of us would watch it especially after moving in together.
We have sex more than regularly and it's never been an issue nor have either of us been too swamped in work to not make that time for one another.

However, a month ago I caught him masturbating to hentai in the bathroom. He never explained the reasoning other than it was because I said I didn't want to have sex - to which I don't recall. I contemplated killing myself after this incident because it hurt so badly but over time I tried to be more trusting. I found out he did it again recently and it was to rape hentai.

Not only are we supposedly both against rape but it just hurt seeing that come up on his reddit.
I made him take a rule to not take his phone to the bathroom anymore and to delete everything he has nsfw content on. I've even said we can try cnc in the bedroom but idk... it feels rather pointless.
I can't compete with fiction.

My life is pretty boring and mundane anyways, I have an array of issues and past trauma but it was nice to have somebody not use me for sex however now I just feel like I'm not enough. I contemplated plastic surgery but I don't even think that's enough.
I feel like the first time this happened, I was able to get over it due to time but the lying has made me even more distrustful.
I feel like I don't know him anymore, we spent so much time together and now it means nothing. Was all of what he agreed with me a lie?
Is he just happier to have somebody there and isn't actually physically attracted to me?
Does he love me or does he just not want to be alone?

I just want to be enough and not feel so crappy. I'm 4'11, tanned skin, braided hair, slim body and I was just starting to accept parts of myself I didn't like such as my chubby thighs and broad shoulders but now I just feel ugly again.
Cutting doesn't even make me feel better, I just want to feel like somebody actually likes me again.
Not just this empty hurt.


I'll take any suggestions, advice or even questions for more context.
I just need some sort of support right now since I don't really have any close friends nor am I close to my family. I need somebody or something right now.
Please give me something so I don't have to attempt again.",1
Trying to succeed this time.,"I've had the poison sitting in my bedroom for a week waiting for the right time. 
Well, I just found out I'm losing my housing, so perfect excuse. I've tried it before, but I'm using quite a bit more this time. Also, running it on my feeding tube, so even when I pass out it will keep being administered.

I'm already feeling drunk, so that's good. I'm so relieved that I started it, it's just annoying how long I'll have to wait.

i just need some advice,"It's gotten so bad lately. I keep thinking of suicide every day. I tried to come up with some ways on how to kill myself, but I'm too weak to do any of them. Everytime i even tried to cut myself, i just stopped because even that was too painful to me. I even tried to jump of a bridge once but i couldn't stop thinking of all the unimaginable pain i would have to overcome before i could finally die.

 Last week i found my mothers sleeping pills and i decided to use them. I decided to do some research before i'll actually use them, but I couldn't find anything about them. After taking at least six of them i just hallucinated for the rest of the night. I guess i just did some bad research so i wanted to ask someone about this. That was when i stumbled upon this reddit page.

 I don't care if someone thinks this is a stupid question or whatever. I know that I'm stupid already. So heres my question. Which type of sleeping pills is the best? How many should i take? I really want to die without feeling any pain. I know it might sound hillarious but i have no other ideas anymore. Also please ignore my writtings, i know it isn't the best since english is my second language. I'm just asking for a simple request, and thanks to anyone who mind helping me out. I just really need to get away from this rotten world.",1

I feel like I'm not meant to be here,"Everything feels empty and distant. I don't feel real. All I do is rot in bed all day, never doing anything significant. I drive everyone away because I feel the need to be the saddest most concerning, most broken person. No good person acts like that.

I feel as if I'm a villain, like I'm just pure evil dragging down the angels around me. I don't understand. Nothing makes sense. I idolize people and then they get tired of me because I can't stop seeing them as amazing and myself as terrible.

I don't understand. Nothing makes sense. I don't want to be here anymore. It feels inevitable that I'm gonna be sad no matter what. I just don't want to be here. Never again. I want to vanish out of this world. I say I want to be forgotten but I don't, I don't want to be mourned but I want to be remembered.

I were told to be annoying, got bullied and still is. CPS took my kid, and yes I am a bad mom. I have autism and a abusive mom, hence why the child were taken. That is all. I go to bed now hoping I choke in my sleep and die. I have consider ending it but really do not wanna traumatize my husband. 

I could swim out in the ocean, but I would not make it far being a bad swimmer. I do want them to find me, it would destroy my mom to not get me back. Beside I feel as if most if not all is better off without me. I am not exactly missed. I have 7 numbers in my phone and 4 facebook friends.. I am just not a person people like, except in passing.

If I take a bunch of pills someone told me I will just throw up.

I really want it to stop hurting. I can´t seek professional help, it will cause issues for my husbands ability to see the kid. So I am on my own.",1
Getting My Affairs in Order While Trans,"I have reasons why I decided that it is soon time to check out. I have some questions about how to go about getting my affairs in order. 

I am estranged from my family and they're not tolerant of me being transgender. I'm afraid that if my family is in charge of my funeral, they will try to erase the memory of the person I was living as for over a decade. They have no idea what my life has been like or what my accomplishments have been and I don't want them keeping the friends who have been closest to me from going to my funeral. 

1. I understand that I am still needing to get my name and gender marker legally changed. I am running out of time before I can still do it legally in my state and possibly the country. 

2. I need help figuring out how to legally enforce who is in charge of my death. I have never married and I have no children. 

3. I need to know how much money I need to bequeath the person in charge of my funeral. I don't want to leave them with any more of a burden than I need to.

4. My cat will probably go to my roommate. They will also probably be in charge of my personal belongings. I don't have that much in the way of financial assets so it probably wouldn't need to put a whole lot I a will.

5. Last but not least I would need to write a suicide letter so that people understand why I decided to kill myself. That I can easily do without help. 

The answer is complicated but I want people to know that it has nothing to do with my transgender status. Family estrangement, poverty and the bleak future has some direct relationship to my trans status but that is not the full reason.

So far, I haven't set a clear time limit yet but I am going to give myself a goal of at least a year to get everything done.",1

I just cant anymore…everything hurts and its hopeless. I cant be helped,"Ive dug myself a financial hole i cant get out of. Im scared of dealing with people, of being judged.

Ive been stsrting to self harm more and more as it gets closer to the end of the month and knowing i cant pay rent. I eat a meal a day not even at this point. 

I almost just want to email the social worker that i just cant anymore.

That i just go into a mental breakdown or some form of a panic attack just thinking about dealing with people or how fucked i am.

Or if i get taken to a hospital therell be no chance i wont lose everything anyways. And i cant just be useless because theyre not going to do it for me. Thats just pathetic anyways to say the least. Im supposed to be an adult anyway

And only person i have who ive been half pushing away out of guilt and all of those other same emotions is in another continent. I dont have any family, i dont have any friends. Is this just it for me and i have to choose between facing my fear of forever or possibly not existing for forever or feeling like im trapped in time for forever? Face the fear of how much physical pain and anguish it might take to do it? Face knowing my sister is going to be in a lot of pain and ill never be able to pay her back for the money shes lent me prior? Or suffer on the streets as it gets colder and colder because i deserve it? And suffer while trying not to die of being fucking autoimmune? Or just stop caring about dealing with that in general?

How to Cope,"Hello everyone,

Just some background. I’ve never officially been diagnosed with anything. But from as early as high school (possibly even before) up until now (28 y/o), I’ve been battling with suicidal thoughts. 

Each time they are pretty vivid imaginations. Thinking of the least painful way to go. Right now, I’ve got the steps to get a hand gun license, drive to some remote (but not too remote, I do want to be found eventually) place, and then wrap my mouth around the barrel and pull the trigger. I’ll have all my beneficiaries set up so everything is transferred.

But I’m a pussy, and never go through with it, and the moments pass and I go on with my life. Each time i think of it though, it hurts a little bit more. I just want the thoughts to go away.

My life isn’t even bad. I’ve lived a very fortunate life. Food, housing, spending money. Not worrying about getting by. But I’m an angry person. Angry at all the minor inconveniences in life.

Idk. I just had to vent. I thought I’d have a question. But I don’t. Felt better letting this go to strangers, than to anyone I know.",1
Shouting into the void,45f. I know no one really cares as i have posted on here before and gotten 0 comments. I am bipolar 1 and ptsd. No matter the treatment I've gotten nothing helps my depression. I got denied for disability because my dr thinks i can work part time. Except every job I've had in the last 5 years I lost because I got hospitalized and they fired me- is that illegal for companies to fire you -yes but they do anyway.  I'm so tired of trying to start over again and again so I've decided this is it. I'm giving society what they want- get rid of the mentally ill. I got rid of almost all of my stuff and registered to donate my body to science. I'm going to take a bottle of benadryl and be done with it. ,1
It seems so comforting.,"I can’t stop thinking about it. Just need a where. Can’t leave my corpse in the room for my roommate to find. I’m selfish enough as is for doing it, cowardly enough to be scared to do it. I don’t think there’s anywhere to buy rope on my base. Not sure if they do that on purpose, they probably do. They keep you trapped in this life without any hope, they’re depriving me of my final escape from life. Of course it was my choice, one that I will never be able to undo. Now it’s too late. I just need to figure out where. I don’t think there’s any trains that run through here, I haven’t heard one, anyway. I don’t expect you to help me out on the method, just wish I could get it over with. I hate this life. I need out.",1
Thinking about killing myself,"I'm so lonely. I have absolutely nobody. Sure I have online ""friends"" but they seem so superficial. I have a partner and yesterday we spent some time together that was really nice. I opened up to them about my anxiety and fear surrounding their up coming surgery. I had a full breakdown driving home from dropping them off. Then they weren't feeling good and we played some videogames and called on discord. Things got better but then there was a really infuriating teammate and they just left. I called their name and they snapped at me. I texted after they left the call and asked if they were mad at me. They said ""really???"" They told me that my self deprication was too much for them and that if today proved anything they needed time appart. This hurt so bad and sent me into a full blown panic attack. I know it's selfish but I feel like I'm constantly beeing to much. Even if i have alot going on mentally, I will still be there to support them regardless of ehat i have going on. Lately it feels like theyve been pulling away and leaving me. This has only made that fear so much worse. They later told me after more texting and calming down that it wasn't me and that they just needed a few days to get some stuff done. I can't help but feel like it's my fault, they literally told me that. Sure they were angry and annoyed but still. There must have been some truth in it. So now I have the next two days all alone. I feel horrible. I haven't gotten out of bed all day, my stomach hurts and my head feels like its been in a microwave. I've been crying on and off all last night and today. I don't know what to do, I genuinely feel like killing myself. For context I live alone in an appartment I moved into about 3 months ago and my partner is nonbinary, just like me.",1
Thank you so fucking much.,You saved me from myself now i got help and am as good as never before. Even if it was a harsh path to go down (telling everyone feels like your naked) its definetly worth it. Why do i thank you? You got me a number i could call in my area.,1
(33m)I don't have much time left,"I'm tired. Mentally, physically, maybe spiritually too but probably not. I'm tired of constantly battling demons in my head, I'm tired of these long fucking waits for my therapy appointments. I'm tired of being fat and ugly, I'm tired of trying to lose weight and within a month of unemployment I nearly gain the 20-30 pounds that I prided myself on losing through effort and better eating habits.  


I'm tired of feeling like I'm never enough for people. I'm never enough for people, I can't maintain friendships anymore because I'm deeply angry, bitter and resentful. I've only had a handful of dates in my life and the only sexual experiences I've had was paying for a sw'r, a quickie in a car and one other recent time during a date. I didn't even enjoy it, I couldn't even perform. I wasn't attracted to them and it just felt empty and meaningless to me. It's nothing without emotional connection, and I can't have that because I'm still a deeply ugly, unattractive person inside and out.   


I'm tired of trying to convince myself and others that I'm somehow a good person. I'm not, I'm deeply selfish and have traits of narcissism. My needs are never met and I'm unable to meet them. I thought for so long a romantic partner could do that, but it won't. I don't value friendships because it doesn't matter how social I am or how much I spend time with people, the pain is still there or it comes back sooner or later. People let me down or inevitably disappoint me in one way or another, or what usually happens is that they get frustrated and tired of me because I'm too needy for them, and the resentment kicks in and things fizzle out afterwards.  


I reconnected with an old coworker and hang out sometimes, but it's always with her husband. I'm tired of being the awkward third wheel, it's humiliating to me and just a firm reminder of what I don't have. I'm 33 years old and still not married or in a long term relationship. I've still never have even had a relationship before. Fucking pathetic at my age.  


I'm tired of being stuck living with my parents. I'm tired of them and dealing with them, all they bring is stress for me and I deeply resent things that they've said to me in the past. But if I move out then I'm stressing out nonstop about recent and bills. Or worse, my roommate would have their SO over daily or they both live together and I have to hear them have sex. Again, fucking humiliating.  


A relationship can't fix this and I know it. But neither can friendships, clearly. I don't have any love anymore, I have none to give. I can't even love myself and I have no energy to deal with anyone but myself, and I can't even do that most of the time.  


It doesn't matter what I do. There's just this big gaping whole in my heart, and nothing can fill it. I'm scared that it can't ever be filled and I just end up living life alone and deeply lonely. No partner, no child or children to love and care for.   


No joy.  
No love.  
No legacy.  
No hope.  
No future.  


People on reddit have been calling me an asshole, incel or loser for years. I guess everyone was right. I'm not a good person. I see everything in extremes, black and white. I don't understand nuance and I don't understand people and why would I? Life has just been one tragedy, failure or disappointment after another.  


There's no nuance to that. Life is just all a big nothing for me.

I can't kill myself because of my family. I would hurt them. I don't think I would hurt them that much but I still would. I have nobody except my family. I lost all my friends. They lost interest in me.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm a nice guy but in this generation it's a bad thing. I tried so much. 

I got so hurt by others I just don't trust anyone anymore not even my family, I feel like someone's constantly watching me. I'm terrified. I just don't what to do. Life is pointless anyway. There is nothing to live for. It's just suffering. I hate everything. I'm sorry for so depressing it's just I don't know. I can't imagine my future. Everybody is doing just fine meanwhile I'm suffering. Nobody cares about me. It would matter if I died but just can't.

im from australia, where the legal drinking age is 18, and i’ve fallen into alcoholism as a result of the physical, mental and emotional abuse over the years. i see hallucinations, obsess over my partner to the point where it’s not healthy and he’s almost grown to hate me (we’ve been together for over 4 years now), and i just feel lost as a person. the only thing comforting me is music at the moment. one of my best friends introduced me to linkin park, and they’ve been keeping me alive for more than a year. i’ve had 6 sui attempts this year, and all have failed.
i am angry at the world for failing me, angry at myself for failing my partner and just generally a bitter person. no one can help. i’m buying a rope later today. no one can help. i just wanted to vent it out before i went",1
The Beginning and the End,"Its been always a tough year for me ever since i was born, I was a happy kid back then i love interacting with people, playing with my friends, and making them happy, so i was always targeted by bullies. ever since i was a child my parents are terrible at parenting i know they grew up on tough and discipline day back then but i just hate them having the toxic traits of other parents (asian) comparing their own son and my mother always accusee me of stealing cuz he caught me one time im taking money on my fathers wallet so i can rent to play on computer cafe. i grew up getting bullied a lot because i don't always act how they want me to act i was unpredictable, the first one who makes me feel i was important was my grandfather he always check if i eat, brought gifts and i always go to his house because he was alone my grand mother die a few years ago when i was a little toddler, we always chat about life and he's the first one to say he was proud of me that i was born i remember a story he told me that he got perk up on his job when i was born because i look like him and how happy and calm always as a baby and he show me a baby picture of me him carrying he was smiling like a child got his wished toy that really boost me up in life cuz someone love me so much and care about me so much. sadly my parents move aways from my grandfather house due to my father hate relationship between his siblings, but even i got away i always carried what he said to me that day but it didn't stop how harsh this world to me. my cousin always bully me cuz i act different im more mature than them i was on first year high school im tall but lazy and lame, i often play alone and enjoy in school cuz i have friends there, but i got on a separate way path i got a friend that lets call a trouble maker so my parents are always got mad at me, i have two sister we don't actually get along that much we constantly fight cuz im the only boy and I don't have any on my side so im always alone, fast forward to 2nd year highschool i got my first reject to a girl cuz of rumors i was a playboy or im a redflag idk what is it my grades aren't always that good im a late bloomer. i discover my mother have a debt we don't know where he spent, now she was the one stealing i got mad at her and i run away. i got my first girlfriend on my 3rd year we're on ldr and we can't meet cuz I don't have money i thought this girl was my one cuz we've been for a year and a half. the downfall of my life started when my father and my grandfather got into a fight about money, i know my grandfather is suffering some old aging symptoms that he was acting a child, forgeting things but can't blame my pop he was alone there. then the next day my grandfather died on December 1st i got really mad to my father that time i refuse to talk to him my father he didn't even bother go to pop funeral most of his sibling visit pop funeral but most are absent due to some of them are living abroad and some are mad my father is one of them i ask what they fight he said my pop was asking for money cuz the money they gave to him he gave to my auntie who was a gambler lying he use it to his sons milk. I save my allowance that time so i can go to my pop grave and on decemeber 25 i finally save enough money and visit his grave, i talk to him how much i feel sorry that i wasn't on his side that day, he really felt alone that time and i blame myself for it that he can see me success anymore i stay on his house for a couple of days and for a lucky my ex was near to that place so he come and we finally met we spend time on my grandfather grave, on 27 of December i come back to my place i say goodbye to my pops and promise I'll comeback, the time i came back at my home my mother was seek and mad about me cuz i stay there for too long. a couple of months my heart got in a real pain one of my friend that friend with my ex caught her with someone else, i check her account on this belieft and i caught her red handed flinging with a girl, i discover he was a bisexual but that was not the hurtful truth, i discover that she was cheating from the very beginning a lot of boys convo i see the day she said she was busy i got really mad and broke up immediately i never talk again for a month until another girl came again to my life but didn't last long, i got three ex the last one destroy me she was abusive physically and emotionally no wonder how i hold on until i met a girl that make my world better again i was on senior now i met a friends that support me but i got family problems i become suicidal, i become unstable i got a fight often with my friends, my mother has a 150k debt, my father is splitting up, my college is impossible because my moms debt, now the one and only making my life bearable i lost because how terrible she said she was suffocate how too much love i gave her, and i become possessive, i know im not but i just on my action i am i wish i could bring her back but its too late now I don't have any choice but to end this all I don't wanna live anymore i will just suffer from pain, i wish i was enough, i wish i fulfill my job to her but i think i can't anymore a message from me im really sorry i love you i hate myself i become like this from the start i wish i was never been born i destroy you, im mad cuz i did all my best i thought was good cuz all you want is more love but i was wrong, this is it I can't bare any of this i just wish all of you will successful i will watch but this is the time you need to cut me out on your rope through the top of the mountain to left me behind in the tunnel see the light cuz i no longer will see it, i wish i could spend more time and fix things i love you all but i think its enough for me I don't fit in this world anymore i will just struggle and suffer for years in pain if i continue i will always be a pain in the ass goodbye i love every moment we have i love you dearest girlfriend (sorry for bad english)",1
Im a social fucking outcast,"No matter how hard I try I will never fit in or be normal. I stand out and always embarrass myself whatever I do, I’m just a freak.

Nothing worth living anymore,"I hate everything in life evrrything makes me anxious and depressed. I cant go to school due to panic attacks, i hate my friend group my s/o left me. Nobody truly love me nor czre for me. I deeply believe im just an piece of shit. 

The only thing bringing me peace is cutting myself and drinking alcohol. I just want to kill myself i cant stop thinking about it",1
Please talk to me,"Im afraid I made a very bad decision today. Everything in my head screamed not to do it. But I did it. And now I can't come down. My anxiety is through the roof.  I want peace, I can't deal with my live. How do I stop it?",1

I think these are my last days... thinking of getting a motel room and,"Drinking a 500mL bottle of antifreeze. I already have it sitting at my side. I had an attempt a year ago with overdosing that affected certain parts of my cns. I took 100k mg of aspirin and ended up in the hospital which was no fun. It left me with certain cns issues that i wont bother to explain but one of them is i cant feel an orgasm anymore I lost everything, wife of 10 years, 100k job, 300k in cash, houses, cars, cats, friends, and family..my mind. Just tired of thinking about what should have been. I had been taking lexapro and adderall and it made me manic. I couldnt jump off a bridge and i dont have access to a firearm so figure this would be my best bet. I dont want to end up in the hospital again, just want to let it take its course. Im selfish; i wish someone could be there with me while i do it so i dont have to go it alone. Part of me wanted to go to new york city and do it there but i dont want to be found in the street and taken to a hospital. At this point its not about if i will do it, but when.
Still here with bottle in hand..contemplation is a mofo",1

Please help,I am 16F I have been a good student all my life but when covid struck my family like all the others were stuck in their homes. It was a difficult time but spending so much time with my parents was nice too (They're both working and rarely ever home) but after lock down ended everyone went back to their lives and I was left all alone in my home shrouded with school. My marks just keep getting worse I may not be promoted. I ahev an exam tmmorow and even though I still have some time to study ihave given up like always.. I try to kill myself whenever exams are done so that I don't have to deal with my parents dissapointment. I m considering jumping off my balcony now so that I don't ruin the goody two shoe image I have infront of my friends and family. Just what do I do please tell me. Anything.,1
I hope I die today,"I can’t handle living anymore and after 3 failed attempts I’m just gonna keep attempting till u succeed. My own family doesn’t give me freedom and I really can’t be loved or take any compliments bc I believe they hold an intention to use or abuse me. Like my exes have done to me in the past. I hate myself everyday and I want nothing more but to end it all. Plus having bpd and depression makes things worse, along with a possibility of having ptsd. I can’t handle this anymore every time I wake up I just wish I was dead.",1

"If my dogs dies, my life ends with her","I cannot live without my dog, her precious smile, her fur, she always seems to understand me… Its like she understands what I am saying.

She calms me, she knows when I’m sad, happy, or ill. She’s always been there for me in the hardest times and I can’t really imagine why else I should live for instead of Maggie.

Am I stupid?,"Sometimes I think all my mental problems would be fixed with a girlfriend and I wonder if that's stupid. I mean, not just any girlfriend, I want someone to hold me and listen to me, I wonder if that's stupid or if it would really help my deplorable mental situation.",1
Notes.,"12:38am November 27. Something is wrong with me. And I mean more wrong than usual. I have an emotional crisis almost every night, and instead of thinking of ways to cope, I immediately jump to suicidal. I think I spend most of my in a dissociative state, but honestly I can't tell. My perception of time is really fucked up, and it's getting hard to remember what day it is. I think I need to take a tolerance break but I also don't really have a lot of support outside of self medicating. I'm slowly inching closer to relapse, and it's just a matter of time at this point. 

The sad part is that suicide feels like a good choice. I know how I'd do it, too. I just haven't figured out if I'm ready to let the world go. I don't know how to say goodbye, or who to tell, or what to tell them. I hate thinking about it because I don't wanna lose Alex, but the thoughts come every day anyway. I'm just a bad day away from tearing myself open again like I used to... 

All I really have left is Alex and Shrike. And my mom of course, but we're not as close as we used to be. I guess I wouldn't really consider myself close to anyone but Alex; I feel so separate from everything else. I feel detached and outcast, even though it's likely my own doing. It's hard to feel close to people when I never really believe what they say to me. It's hard for me to even believe that people like me. Or even don't *dislike* me. I'm pretty sure all of Alex's friends only put up with me because they like him. The way they don't really seem interested in interacting with me.. it brings back old feelings of worse times. My own anxiety triggers me I guess.

It's a little wild that I'm able to keep so much to myself. Alex is the only person who even knows that this is going on. Sometimes I wish I could let people in, because maybe they could help me. But I don't know if I want help. I just want to rest. I'm so tired of trudging through the same shit day after day and not getting anywhere. No steps forward, half step back, it seems. I feel like I'm slowly slipping away and nobody has realized it. As if I'm slowly fading into the background, and eventually I'll disappear completely. It's for the best. 

I really don't know if the garage door track can support my weight, or if I'd be able to fix something up that could. I'm thinking about taking my Christmas lights down and using that, because at least the lights would be pretty. I hope they don't break if that's what ends up happening. The other worry I have is of my parents finding me. If I open the garage just enough for someone to duck under, then I could call a hotline before kicking out the chair, but that doesn't guarantee anything. Ideally I dont traumatize anyone. Nobody wants to be the one who finds a dead kid.",1
I might die one day If I didn't get any good friends & best friends,I'm an Indian girl & I think it's useless to live in a country with a second largest population coz I'm lonely af & my classmates don't seem to give a damn 'bout my feelings. Teachers are good but I need some1 of my same age to interact with. Ik my problem would be solved if I got therapy or psychiatric medicines( but I think it's useless when people in your surroundings are dumb af). My treatment is ongoing but the problem is that in govt. hospitals waitlist is long af & to avoid that I can go to a pvt. hospital but again psychiatric services are expensive there. Due to this I feel like ending my life & sometimes I don't feel like eating food even though my stomach is rumbling from hunger. I hate going school but have to coz maintaining 75% nd above attendance is mandatory & I'll miss out on many important topics done in the class. Teachers in my class wonder why I sleep so much in free time. The reason is I think it's better to be asleep than to interact with anyone who doesn't give a damn 'bout ur feelings. ,1
Only alive for my family ATP,"I’m fifteen. I have no interests, no hobbies, no skills, no talents, I can’t even do normal day to day tasks. I’ve switched schools three times this year because I’m avoiding consequences for not doing my work. I’ve wanted to commit since 3rd grade. There’s not much point in staying around to suffer any longer—but I can’t put my family through that.

My parents separated when I was six, which did spare me some trauma. My mom went on to enter several abusive relationships which brought up her old trauma and addictions. She is extremely mentally ill. My dad was and is severely depressed. I went back and forth between houses until I was ten. I then moved in with my grandparents who have a disabled son that they take care of 24/7. They are both also depressed. My mom comes and goes and we never know where she is, but I’m her everything. I also have two dogs, age sixteen and eleven. I love them so much.
 
I have to watch every single one of them go before I do. My dogs will hurt the most, and they’re the soonest.

Am I selfish?,"I’m sorry I just really need a place to vent this all out.


I have been struggling for quite some time, holding myself onto the few people that care about me and love me. I have them, I have had one too many chances to change my life, my self destructive habits, my self esteem, motivation, etc, and yet I haven’t. I haven’t changed. I am 22 now, I have been the exact same way since I was 15. I have so many reasons to feel alive and all I want to do is throw everything away and slit my wrists, take one too many medications, starve myself enough to pass out in the middle of work or a class, anything that would get me hospitalised. I am still the same; am I selfish for wanting that? I keep feeling like a want a break from everything, to let my unfiltered raw emotions out for once and suffer smaller consequences for it than losing everything. I want a small break from everything and hurting myself is all I can think of. I keep holding everything in for my family, my friends, my future spouse, my career; I have so many things going for me and I know I am selfish for wanting a break from all of this. I feel miserable, yes, others have it worse than me, I have seen how hard people struggle in making ends meet, how some don’t have nearly half of what I have. Am I selfish? Spoiled? I cannot seem to appreciate what I have no matter what I do and yet I am terrified of losing it all over again deep inside. I hate myself more than anything. I have responsibilities, stuff to work on, yet I cannot force myself out of bed. I really hate myself. I cannot kill myself still I guess out of either a little more respect for those around me and the consequences, or perhaps just fear that once I reach that point again, I will go through it. I just want to hurt myself or break myself enough to get a breather. But life goes on and time doesn’t stop, even if I went through with this, things would become so much worse for me after this “little break” ends. I feel so trapped inside and I don’t know what to do anymore.
I know I’m selfish. I know I’m stupid to even post this. I don’t know what to do anymore. Perhaps killing myself would be the best option and let those who actually need these opportunities make better use of them. Leave what I have to those who can actually appreciate it.",1
It got better,"I graduated highschool recently, and no one really came except this one girl named Lauren who I had a falling out with about a year prior. I don't know why I invited her. I cried for so long in her arms and I kept repeating I made it. I don't know if she knew what I was talking about. Maybe she did because she cried too. I didn't think I would make it to graduation. It's not all good, but most days there's something there. When I was posting on this page I wish I had seen what I'm writing now. It gets better. It also gets worse.

I think the most amazing girl I’ve met is finishing things with me,"My whole world is crashing down. I think the girl of my dreams is finishing things with me and my mind and heart can’t take it.

I don't feel anything worth living for,"I (3x, M) think my dopamine has stopped working. I haven't felt happiness, excitement, an adrenaline rush or anything in years. I've tried a couple of recreational drugs that typically raise your mood and they didn't change anything, so I gave up. I think it started slowly, it's hard to tell. My memory is crap, I think because everything is numb. Food has no flavour. I can't relate to people or share their lives. None of my old hobbies spark anything. I don't get sad anymore either. Can't cry. Frustration barely starts, it's more like hopelessness. I feel so empty I want to take my life. I don't care about how it affects others. I don't think I have empathy anymore. Sometimes I think I'm dead already. I don't know how much longer I can do this. Every set back and challenge just makes me surer that I need to die to make it stop.

I wish my parents didn’t love me,"I really want to kill myself I hate my life and myself and being alive it’s too much for me. 3 years ago I attempted suicide and I remember the pain my parents went through it was so bad. They put me in therapy and got me on meds they tried their best to help, and eventually I just pretended like I healed because if they knew I was still like this I know they would blame themselves and they don’t deserve that. Today I cut myself again tho and i feel embarrassed to admit that no matter how much I genuinely tried I never ultimately got better. Ive accepted the fact that I am incapable of ever getting better that I will always feel like this that’s why I would rather just kill myself. But if I killed myself my parents would be so distraught I remember my mom told me that if I didn’t survive my attempt she would’ve killed herself too. I don’t want my parents to be sad or my siblings or my friends I just want to fade away or never have existed at all or go back to when I was 14 and stayed underwater instead. Even tho I want to I can’t kill myself. I can’t keep living like this tho. I can’t even go to a hospital or psych ward cause it’s too expensive. I can’t talk to anyone bc not only is there no one to talk to I also can’t even communicate how I feel. I can’t do anything I’m too lazy and tired. Idk what to do anymore god",1
"Aimless Venting- and what can you even say to it? ""Sorry you're going thru it? I know the feeling? Been there? This too shall pass?"" So why even post it? Because the void is too good to listen to us scribbles, I guess.","I genuinely hate being alive. That's the first thing, and it's true. Most of the time. Even when I'm happy or enjoying myself or being praised or accomplishing things. The despair is still there. The happiness is imitation vanilla. It tastes like happiness, as long as you don't examine it closely.

What good is a feeling you can't examine closely?

Then there is the next thing. I don't deny the existence of happiness. Some people are. I don't deny the existence of love: most people do. What I deny is the idea that it somehow evens out the existence of suffering, the naked fact that we inflict suffering on others, that this will change in any way that isn't merely palliative.

Palliative care is good. You should make things easier and more comfortable for people, but for humans, terminal is at least a little ways off (A ways enough that we can pretend it isn't, like how most people live their lives). 

But if the rot at the heart of it isn't going away, if the suffering is a necessary part of it, even down to the Omelas child, then I think we really need to talk about voluntary euthanasia. 

Or we would if the metaphor was extendable.Truthfully, as certain as I am, I don't get or want to make that decision for anyone else. I'm grateful for many people now alive. It will be an unimaginable loss when they die. Everyone's death is a genocide, more than that, it's a universe squandered. 

My death will be too. But I don't want to be here anymore. 

I don't want to be a part of it. I don't like it. I don't want it.

It's all I can think about. Like maybe I can temporarily distract myself with an interesting enough problem, a reliable source of dopamine, loving my people, whatever. But it ends, quicker than for most people I think, and there I am and there's that inescapable fact, that emotional reality that is there waiting for me.

Perhaps I'm being dismissive when I say no therapist or counselor or psychologist is going to make that not true. But I don't think I am. The meds make it ""bearable"" sometimes, for a while. That's the best case scenario for a therapist too, I think.

Like I can maintain the moral stance, the rigorous love that prevents my suicide. But deep down, I still don't want to. The reality is still there. I do not like this life. I do not like this universe. I do not like this society. I do not like this culture.

It produces the most heartbreakingly beautiful things: music, kindness, stories, Crater Lakes. But they're necessarily the most heartbreakingly beautiful things. They are the only things.

Living in a world where people die is so deeply disturbing and evil that it makes me want to die. How's that for a stupid but accurate calculus?

God I fucking hate this. I fucking hate all of it. I fucking hate writing this down, again, for the thousandth time, and knowing I have to write it down another thousand times, because I'm still going to be here, these things are still going to be true, and I can't do a fucking thing about it. It's that: that's the pain that suicide would relieve. Being here, doing this, feeling this, over and over and over again.

The only cure is forbidden.

Fuck.

Anyway it really sucks and I definitely wish I were dead. But I'm not. I have to wait. And in the meantime I can't even really enjoy what I have, or do much of that palliative tikkun olam shit, or even make up my stupid little stories and drawings and songs and games because this feeling weighs me down and breaks my brain.

I get stupider and stupider every day. I was always forgetful, now it's such a pervasive forgetfulness that... I can't even remember how I was going to finish that sentence. 

I hate being alive. I hate myself. I hate that this didn't make me feel better. I hate that I tried anyway.

Dear God, or god, or gods, or not, please just send a fucking meteor into my head. Baseball sized would be enough. I know you sent me the boulder in the canyon, but I fucked up. So have you. The whole thing is fucked up. You could have at least provided an off switch.

Anyway, I get to try these pointless exercises and failed techniques again tomorrow, after the one relief I have gets taken from me. But for now, sleep.",1
everyday i wake up with tears in my eyes because im still alive.,"i was a mistake.

i am so tired of ‘being strong’ and suffering. be strong for what?… to continue being miserable? being strong has gotten me nowhere. nothing i do works out. my business is failing, i’ve been depressed for years, my anxiety is crippling, i can’t even talk to people without feeling like im going to fucking pass out. and im awkward as fuck. social skills literally on 0.

i have ptsd, severely emotionally unstable (bipolar disorder) and every day is shitty. i feel so sorry for the people who are sick and wish they had life .. id trade with them. because i sincerely do not want mine. i used to think everyone has a purpose (like people love to say) .. but i really have no reason to be here. i was a mistake. my 26 years of misery, abuse, depression, mental illness, hating myself, and never being good enough for anyone proves that to be true. 

i have been depressed since childhood. my first suicidal thoughts were when i was 8 years old. 

i’ve tried twice already. unfortunately here i am making this post that i will probably delete a few hours after anyway. 

my mind never stops. it just goes and goes and goes. im exhausted. i want to experience silence in my mind. i have insomnia, i have barely slept in 2 years but i hide it well.

im scared to sleep. im not even safe in my sleep. i am not free. then when i do try to sleep i wake up a million times and end up staring at the ceiling for fucking hours.

really, i am only torturing myself the longer i stay here. 

i’m a prisoner in my own mind. i have no friends, the only ‘friends’ i’ve ever had were from elementary/hs but they were not real friends, actually they were very shitty and in retrospect definitely jealous .. one of them even drugged me after high school when i was 19 so.. there’s that. :) needless to say since then i don’t trust people and i have never had true friends in my entire life. my own sisters have betrayed me as well. and have done some unforgivable shit. living with all of this bitterness and anger is also killing me.

the only boyfriend i ever had in my life cheated on me with prostitutes, had a secret sex addiction and had orgies in hotels with his own father. i was exposed to a lot during that relationship and im pretty much traumatized. anyway, broke up with that mf almost 5 years ago. and guys after that have only wanted to use me (which i did not let them do)

this post is all over the place.. im not in my right state of mind. i cant even believe im writing this shit. time is flying and im getting older … i’ll be 27 in february …that scares me and tbh i don’t plan on seeing that birthday. my entire life has been wasted on nothing but suffering. why continue?

i cry every year on my birthday anyway. i don’t feel like anyone has ever truly loved or valued me. i’ve always felt so deeply for others with all the fibers of my being and i gave and gave and gave until i had nothing left. i was never enough. i’ve been rejected, used, abused, assaulted and discarded like trash, by everyone.

i wish i didn’t have to suffer everyday. it hurts so much to even breathe. everything takes so much energy from me. taking a piss, shitting, eating.. it’s so exhausting. its like i die a little more inside every time i exert energy doing these small things… these small things that feel like huge things. im hurting. it hurts. my body hurts. my heart aches. i don’t even know myself. i’ve lost myself completely throughout the years. each person who has betrayed or hurt me has taken a chunk out of me. a piece of my soul, a piece of my being. now when i look in the mirror i am distorted. i don’t even know what im looking at. im looking at nothing. fragments of a person… broken beyond repair.

if it’s not one thing it’s another. i just want to rest. i want peace. emotional peace, mental peace.",1
overdosed,"i took 10k mg of Tylenol last night, why hasn’t it killed me already? should i take more ?",1
Close to the end,"I'm almost 40. I have had attempts since I was 14. No one cared then, and no one cares now. 

I had an attempt last Saturday. I took many pills in front of my husband, and was also drinking. I asked him if I would die, and he said, ""I don't know, I guess we'll see."" Then he played Call of Duty the rest of the night and slept on the couch. 

I went upstairs and laid in bed. I was sure I was going to die. I wrote a suicide letter and passed out. I woke up two hours later, vomited, and then went back to bed. I slept an entire day. My husband did not check on me...ever. 

Now it has been a week. I'm trying to get better, but I don't feel better. I just do whatever housework needs to be done, take care of my pets, and then lay down and think about killing myself for hours. 

I hope I die soon. I wish I wasn't so cowardly and could just do it now. Instead, I keep agonizing over how I should do it and how not to traumatize my husband. 

There is no future, there is no hope. I'm close to the end now, I can feel it.

The love of my life moved out and abandoned me when I trusted her to support me,"Girlfriend F(20) moved out without notice, after agreeing to pay rent, the groceries, and everything else we needed to support my stroke recovery and chronic health. She began fighting with me every day of the week. It started to become violent and then stopped. She went to live back with her family and took all her important things. Her narcissistic family corroded her position in the relationship when they took her in, and manipulated her into framing me as the perpetrating abuser when in reality it was mutual and she often initiated. They knew she was vulnerable and confused. They were always biased against me M(20) out of spiteful judgment that was generalized, projected, and non-applicable.

Last year I had a stroke and I'm impaired. I can't walk properly, talk verbally, or think enough to function executively. Tasks around the home are starting to be impossible without help, and I can barely eat.  She said the relationship was over and that we were no longer in contact. She threatened to charge me with harassment after I tried to reach out to mend our differences reasonably. Her family has a law background. I recently discovered she screenshotted all my attempts to reach out to her and shared them with her friends and family while humiliating and shaming me together as a ritual. Our relationship is 6 years old and we've been together since we're 14.

I have no friends, no family, and no support systems. I have no funds. I've tried to apply to 300+ jobs to nothing

Yesterday, I added a rope from Amazon to my cart with the little money I managed to collect selling the belongings in the apartment that I had left.

This is the last straw. I've gone through too much meaningless suffering all my life and plan to use my new pull-up bar as the leverage to hold the rope around my neck with the practice videos teaching the hangman tie, on January 1st. When the rent is due and I can't pay. I don't know what my options are from here. I tried to communicate with her and hear her. I still love her. I can't get out of this hell alive.

"Everyone wants to listen, but I don’t wanna talk anymore.","The same, damn story, emotionally, physically, and sexually abused (23f)girl depressed about the whole world. 

I started so hard in college in a stupid tech degree that I didn’t even like so that I could go away from my abusive family as quick as possible. Then as soon as I was able to get a job there was extreme cruelty in mass lay offs. Nobody at my company, including meee has been able to get a single job offer after applying to more than 20 jobs a day for more than six months. I changed careers and I’m in grad school right now to become a therapist, I love my field so much and yet I’m a hypocrite. I counsel people while harming myself every night. I haven’t been able to get a single job and I can’t afford to move out so I have to live with the people that treat me like a ragdoll.

I’m so ready to go. It’s so easy too. That’s the craziest part. I am dealing with all of these problems, crying myself to sleep every single night, but I could put an end to it, so easily, one easy, single gunshot to the head, and then it’s all over. I could simply erase all my problems. It makes so much logical sense. It doesn’t make any sense at all tonight shoot myself in the head.

Everyone wants to listen, but I don’t want to talk anymore. Everyone around me wants to hear from me. They say oh no I’m so sorry you’re going through that you can talk to me anytime. Has anyone ever had it occurred to them that maybe I just wanted a couch to sleep on so I didn’t have to experience abuse?? Like why is it so difficult to wrap your head around? I don’t want to be heard like I’m some weird entertainment for you. I want someone to offer me housing , but there is none so I just wanna die instead. I just don’t understand how can you call yourself someone’s friend while not doing anything while they experience torture?

I don’t want to talk anymore, I have told everyone my story, they know what I went through. They just don’t want to do anything about it. So I don’t wanna talk anymore, I don’t wanna say anything ever again.",1

Feel really weird writing this,"No idea why I am writing this. I guess I just feel like shit and no one wants to listen to me complain about how ""terrible"" my life is. I mean I know I am so privileged and lucky to be born in this weird county called America where we are ""free"" but this country is just going to shit. Enough of that though. 

I hate my life and feel like I dont want to live anymore, because I fucking don't. (Sorry if my grammar just gets worse and worse throughout this post)  I feel like I have more intense emotions than everybody else especially anger, I am very quick to anger and I dont particularly like that about myself but what the fuck why not. I am just trying so hard to be a better person and change how I do things but I always circle back to this primal feeling of fear and pure anger which I just cant seem to get away from. 

Sometimes I feel like I am making things up, like I dont actually have a personality and I am just this fake annoying peice of shit that doesnt even deserve to exist, so I could just take it away from myself, I mean why not? The world is already taking a nose dive off a cliff so why not just take myself out on my own terms instead of dying a slow and painful death or a quick one without any time to make amends with the world and myself. I can just leave before it gets any worse, yknow? I am also just really afraid of  death if that makes any sense at all. I wouldnt have to worry about that either if I go out when I know and choose, its nice having that certainty that I feel like Ive never really had before. 

I dont really feel like anything is real, and I am SO FUCKING TIRED of people saying ""Oh you really think somebody \[insert condescending phrase here\] for you?"" like do you really think THAT FUCKING HELPS? LIKE AT ALL? Making fun of me wont do SHIT it just makes me hide it more and more driving me fucking insane from all of these anxious thoughts and weird ideas just floating around in my head. I dont understand why people think they can just ""help me"" by saying some weird over used quote like ""Stay strong 💯💯💯"" or ""Stay strong 😎"" or ""Keep going"" I know theyre trying but it doesnt feel like it. its like having ""fake friends"" theyre just there to make you feel better that you don't actually have any other friends. Its a fucking joke.

Life just feels like a sick joke, I know thats a bit overused but thats exactly what it feels like to me, everything IS A FUCKING JOKE. I just want to leave it all behind. Is that TOO HARD TO FUCKING ASK??? I know rant posts like this barely get any traction and I am fine with that, Id rather be shouting out to the void and it not answer. 

All my little issues just compliment each other perfectly like theyre meant to be there. What if my only purpose in life is to die, just so my death impacts someone else, what if I really dont have a purpose, what if I dont end up making any FUCKING DIFFERENCE? Why do I even feel like I have to do something? Why would I? I mean I want to, but is there really any reason? Maybe I am just crazy and I should just shut up already and become the next homeless person on the street, its noy like me doing anything in life helps. 

When I am supposed to be happy i am not. Even if I live the perfect life eventually, I wont be able to enjoy it, just because of my stupid fucked up brain. 

Because I am rarely vulnerable with people i have a friend group where we just... don't.  I dont have anyone to talk to and its worse cause its MY FUCKING FAULT. I dont know what I did that was so wrong  but life is really putting me through hell, mentally at least. AGAIN I come around to the ""Well other people have it worse!"" thing and its just annoying. WHY WHY WHY DO I DO THIS??? Why donI constantly compare myself to everyone, all the FUCKING TIME, ABOUT ANYTHING? Its like my brain wants me to give up.

I have already reached a mental breakdown multiple times, I think? I dont really know, I guess I didnt do my homework. I JUST WANT TO BE OKAY? But what would life even look like if I wasnt like this?  It wouldnt feel right? I just cant even begin to grasp how differnt and how much more happy I would be if I was just NORMAL? 

I still feel like I am faking it, i dont know just like making shit up so people will feel bad for me, but then I realise I dont even want people to feel bad for me. But still feel like I cant function properly as a human being. I WANT TO RIP MY FUCKING HAIR OUT JUST TO FEEL SOMETHING. I DONT FUCKING FEEL RESL BUT NOBDY EVEN CARES OR JUST TALKS DOWN TO ME?

id rather die than live like this for more than I have to and i probably will soon, I dont want to be the sex I was born in, with my whole heart i fucking hate it but theres no way, ill ever be the person I wish to be

something in my brain is broken and theres no cure, and it crushes me, that im something that needs to be fixed, that im something wrong, that im fake, that this whole thing is just a disorder, something that shouldnt be but is because I have the worst luck in the word

At this point why shouldnt I kill myself? Noones gonna love me or desire me, ill have to hide who I am, people will see me only as a label, and the Rest will try to take away my right or try to kill me, 

what is so great out there to keep my useless body alive for, how can this get any better? When all I feel towards myself is disgust, I dont even want to masturbate so i dont have to touch that ugly shit between my legs, and a bottom surgery? Yeah noone want barerly functional cock either 

All I hope for now is something good after death, my life lost all meaning, I only live because my family would be sad, and everyday is miserable and I can only watch ad everything turns into dust under my hands",1

"I am comforted by the fact that I almost have all of the pieces in place for my plan, and I’m not sure if that’s progress or not.","For context:

I have bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, and my NP thinks that I might have bpd but isn’t sure yet (I think I do too). I have a girlfriend that I’ve been with for 7 years and she makes me very happy, but it hasn’t always been this way. We’ve been together since the summer after high school. This is both of our first relationship and we took each other’s virginities. I had a bad concussion my freshman year of college, and my life hasn’t been the same since. I ended up having to drop out due to my post concussion syndrome. This is when my bipolar disorder and borderline-like symptoms started to come out. I put my girlfriend through hell, constantly accusing her of cheating and telling her that I’m suicidal. This lasted for years. During this time, I worked a series of dead end jobs because that was all that I could do. I was horribly depressed and had no ambition. I hurt a lot of people. What sucks the most is that the closer I was to people during that time, the more I hurt them. I had horrible abandonment issues and still do. A few years ago, I had a very serious manic episode which included some psychotic symptoms. This took place after my house caught on fire and my family and I had to live in various hotels for a year and a half. After about 8 months of isolation and yet another concussion, I finally broke and embarrassed myself and everyone close to me. I also hurt them. I lost many friends and almost my girlfriend. Things have been getting progressively better since then as I am now in treatment. My relationship is better than ever and my girlfriend seems happy, but I can’t get over the guilt and shame from that several years long stretch. I hurt everyone around me due to my mental illness that I didn’t even know existed. My girlfriend says that she forgives me but I don’t know how, as I haven’t forgiven myself. I don’t think I ever can. It’s very debilitating. I’ve been contemplating suicide because I think it’s the only way to end this. I think my girlfriend will finally be able to find someone that will treat her well from the beginning to the end and never hurt her. I think she’ll find someone who will make her happier than I ever could. That’s what she deserves. I thought about just breaking up with her, but I just can’t live without her. I would probably just end up killing my self anyway. I have been thinking up a plan to do it for the past couple of weeks and tomorrow, I will have everything I need to do it. I feel this strange sense of comfort knowing that I could do it at anytime. Will the comfort make me less likely to do it because I can now enjoy life more? Will it make me more likely to do it sooner rather than later? I’m not really sure if this makes things better or worse.

TLDR - I am ridden by guilt and shame from how I behaved due to undiagnosed mental illness, and I think that everyone, mainly my girlfriend, will be better off. This has made me suicidal. I almost have all of the supplies needed to do it and am unsure if the comfort that I feel is progress or not.",1
"I am tired of using Facebook because my friends do not care me anymore, and I want to suicide next year if one of my friends still do not care for me.","A few days ago, I deactivated my Facebook account for a week or extending it to another because my friends do not care me anymore.

But with that project, I became envious because I did not have that one back then.

Fortunately, I started to build my group of friends last year, but when the time passes, they slowly not caring me again even my questions on academic subjects.

Help,"39(M) Just overwhelmed with all of the thoughts in my head. Re-living some past issues after some bad, but good news. 

To start, I have tried to commit suicide 4 times throughout my life and was almost successful on the last attempt, by sheer luck I survived. 

My issue stems from the last time I attempted. The feelings came flooding back after I found out that my one that got away recently got divorced. While I am extremely happy that she is out of that violent relationship, my last attempt at suicide was on the day she married that person. 

I cut myself pretty deep then. I just laid down and just closed my eyes feeling myself bleed out. I was content and at peace. However I must have moved my arms after passing out, which caused the bleeding to stop. How very disappointed I was when I woke up to a congealed mass of blood and that I was still alive. 

I hid my wounds from my family and coworkers (I would add friends here but I don’t have any) and fully dove head first into work. It took 2 years to not want to die every single day. I was hurt. I loved her beyond what I knew, but I was cast aside because of her group of friends did not approve of me. 

They didn’t approve of me because I spent some time in prison and most ignorant people, don’t realize that not everyone that has been incarcerated is a bad person or “evil.” (I may share that whole nightmare on a different subreddit.)

My suicidal thoughts are now focused on, stem from the fact that she will fall to peer pressure again and I know, that no matter what I do, I won’t get my chance with her. I take rejections seriously to the heart, because every time that I am rejected, it is another stab to the heart. 

 It feels like every time I get back on my feet (mentally) I get knocked down further and further than the last time I fell. I see no hope for my future. I’m feeling the same pain all over again and I can’t seem to find a way out of my head. 

I’m stuck in a psychological loop of the feelings that I have felt years ago, but they are amplified. What makes matters worse is that everyone that I have reached out to (for the last month), has either ignored me or has given me a monosyllable responses or some cheap platitudes. 

So, in my pain, I am reaching out to Reddit to get some feedback and get a different point of view, from someone outside my head. 

I do not have a formal plan to end it all, but I have a rough draft in my head that would be much quicker than last time. 

(Also, as a side note the one that got away does not know that I attempted suicide. I think that (well before posting this) 2 people knew that I did. I got caught cleaning my wounds and was asked about it. Not surprised that they didn’t care to talk about it.)",1
How do I feel?,"I mean the title in a sense of, how do I feel… not how am I doing. I know I feel like i’m in a bottomless pit of despair, but I can’t put my finger on every single thing causing it. I know the obvious; my past trauma. I’ve tried to confide in some. I feel like I could talk…. but when it comes down to it, I have no idea what to say other than “I don’t want to be alive”. How does one feel? I think I’ve lost all ability to legitimately feel anything but anger and sadness and when I feel these emotions I can’t explain it.",1
"I’m at my roads end, I can’t seem to be okay","I’m 17 years old. I’ve been depressed since the 6th grade. I’ve tried everything to make me feel happier. I got a girlfriend, I didn’t feel happy. I lost my virginity, I didn’t feel happy and instead I have lasting trauma because of it. I’ve switched medications to see if that was causing me to feel depressed, I feel exactly the same. I started working out, I look good but I don’t feel good. I’ve gone to therapy, I spent hundreds of dollars only for my therapist to say she doesn’t want to see me anymore. I’ve had people come and go in my life and I’ve had friends and family die which makes me feel worse and worse. I’ve never been so alone in my entire life, I have no one to talk to about how I feel, I’ve been single for years and even thought I didn’t feel happy in a relationship I still miss the feeling of being comforted and loved. I have a college admission decision coming in the next couple of weeks and if it goes south and I don’t get in then it may be the last straw. I’m tired of trying and I’m tired of failing. Nothing makes me happy, and nothing can change that.",1

Sorry for short post,"I've just realized that I don't even cry anymore when I get suicidal thoughts. I used to cry, cry until I got a headache, fall asleep and forget by the morning. Now I have gotten to the point where I simply accept them. Not in a good way, either, I know something's going to happen someday if I dont get help but for some reason I just refuse to tell my feelings to a single soul other than a reddit made for anonymous posters. I just ramble on and on writing thoughts as they go through my head, nobody wants to read this jumbled shit. I don't know why I do this. I know there's something wrong with me but I'm almost at the point where I like it this way. I've had this dark cloud above me for over a decade at this point and honestly I find it comforting, yet I am oh so scared at the same time.

I'm looking back at the title and laughing rn. This post was only supposed to be the first three sentences, but it turned into... this",1
if i was happy,"id still kill myself so that i can die happy. and never go back to how i felt before.

i spent all my life depressed.

and if i died today. id be happy. 

i dont want to suffer .",1
I'm tired of all the Waiting,"Most of my life has been some form of waiting, waiting till 18, Waiting for Appointments, Waiting for Events, Waiting till the things that are meant to help me to actually help me.

I'm 26 I've been trying for so long to make my life better but I always seem to mess it up and end up worse than I started. I'm now fully diagnosed with Autism (Level 2) with all my other undiagnosed issues due to finances and I'm working towards getting on the DSP, I'm working on also fixing my NDIS plan, and I'm also working on getting into social housing but as usual I can't do more on them until things happen out of my control. so I'm left waiting, looking for different avenues and options sure but failing at every turn. I'm stuck with my neglectful and Conspiracy Theorist Parents in the middle of nowhere and I've had my best friend, girlfriend, and every friend in general turn their backs on me, be incapable of helping me, or just ignore me.

I'm Isolated in my parents shed with no car and civilisation an hours walk away. I have friends online keeping me somewhat sane but I've only had online friends for most my life and the lack of physical interaction is draining me. 

I've nearly reached the end a few times now.  
I don't really know what to do anymore. Everything is just waiting for things to happen like it always is.   
I don't know if I will be able to stop the thoughts the next time my depression gets bad.  
I tried reaching out to a suicide prevention line last time but they had an emergency and couldn't call me back because I live in a shed that acts as a faraday cage and sitting outside with the snakes at night was equivalent to suicide anyway.  
Sorry.",1
Feeling trapped,"Okay so. Can’t cut myself anymore, I’m out of room on my legs, it doesn’t give me the same feeling it used to. It used to make me feel like I was doing SOMETHING about my depression, now it’s just, not worth it. I used to consider suicide a very genuine option, but all of you guys say it never works, chances are I’ll end up sick or paralyzed, then life will go back to normal and I’ll have to deal with the consequences.
So now what? 
I’ve been to therapy for a long time, I’ve gotten help.
I have support, I have medication, I have more than most of you guys. 
I’m sorry all these resources are going to waste on me, nothing is helping me. I’ve felt like this since I was 12 at least. 
I can’t do anything about how I feel, I think I’m going to want to die forever.
I’m so scared I’ll make it to 80 and realize I was never happy, and I’ll regret it all",1

Cheated on,"I've had suicidal thoughts all my life, along with depression and anxiety, the whole package. But it's never gotten to the point where it's this bad.

Back at June this year, I broke up with my gf of 3 years, cause she cheated on me. I've experienced a breakup before (once). But it was less painful, she didn't cheat on me and I have forgiven myself for that. But this? Without exaggeration, it was the worst fucking feeling I have ever experienced. I feel like I've just been tossed down a cliff, and now my bones are all broken. I genuinely think I have a shot at climbing back up this cliff.

But is it worth it?

Sure I can heal, sure I can push myself to climb back up again. But, then what? I stayed with my ex through her toughest times, I was there everyday and every night, for her. I did it because I felt there was a connection between us, that maybe if I did these things for her, I can do something important with my useless life. And maybe, she would be there when I needed her. But that never happened, and it will never fucking happen.

Will someone out there fight as hard as I did for me? Do I have to climb the cliff first to find this someone? When do I have to stop fighting so damn hard?

I have lived a pretty decent life. I got family and friends. But I'm just so tired. So tired... I still have so much to live for, but I just cant get that feeling out my head, that if I just slit my throat all of this would be over. The fight will end, and I will be at peace, once again.

I know I probably won't get answers from any of you here, I need to do that on my own. But, I'm glad that you have read this, and for that I thank you.",1

Genuinely why shouldn’t I kill myself,"Im a 16 year old guy. In short I have no good qualities and im not good at any particular thing. I’ve had opportunities to grow and I’m still the same lazy fuck. Everytime I try to do anything good or take any risk I just end up negatively impacting someone else. There’s no point in me being alive if that’s going to happen forever. 

The only reason I dont want to kill myself is that my family would feel like they failed, and I dont want that. I just want them to be happy, but I feel like they’ll never be happy with my around. I just wish I could take myself out of the equation without my family thinking I intentionally killed myself.

I live just next to a road with plenty of cars, and it wouldn’t be hard to step out and “accidentally” get fatally hit by one. I can’t think of any reasons why this wouldn’t be the right decision, bc keeping myself alive would just be selfish.

I’m asking this genuinely, should I do it? And don’t just say no because it’s morally right, give me one reason why someone like me should actually be alive if I’m just going to hurt everyone else’s limited time their lives.",1

Why TF Am I Psychologically So Weak,"I've already posted here a couple times already, so I won't give my whole back story over and over again.

I feel like I'd rather die than take responsibility, and the thing I should take responsibility for isn't even that big of a thing. In this case I am about to take some exams and that's pretty much it, at least for some people. But for me even the mere thought of taking exams is scary. And it's not Just the exam either, even something as simple as getting into a job feels like a scary thought for some reason. I have already attempted suicide a year ago and I know it's nasty and scary stuff for the person who has done it and their friends and families, but I am growing ever closer to doing it again. Please help me cheer up or some shit. I don't want to be a weak fucker like this anymore. I am a 21 year old male btw.",1
Mental Hell,"Let me be blunt. I hate talking about my issues. People live far and away worse lives than I do. Far as I can tell, the life I was given has been decent.

And yet, I am here. I'm a 19 year old 158 lbs guy who had scholarships for academics and athletics to college. Never had legal trouble. Had love. But things started going downhill for me back before COVID hit.

In September of 2020, I was diagnosed with severe social anxiety, PTSD from the death of my baby brother, depression, and hypertension blood pressure. Which again, far from the worst disorders that someone can unfortunately get. I also had a torn ligament in my knee and had packed on a ton of weight, believe I was at 225 lbs by that point. But as if to add fuel to the fire, by the beginning of January 2021, I had lost my aunt to suicide and my grandpa to some liver disease. And on January 24th, 2021, I experienced my first breakdown. It's a long story, but basically my father told me how becoming a journalist and sports reporter/broadcaster was a horrible idea because due to my social anxiety, I would never last.

So on Jan. 25th, 2021, I had my first suicide attempt. I attempted to hang myself using a flimsy belt I had. It broke the wooden staircase pole thing it was attached to, and I survived. It woke my mother up who found me in a heap sobbing. The next day, I was admitted into a psychiatric facility, where I stayed for a week.

During my stay, I met someone who I will just refer to as T. She was someone I actually felt very comfortable around and very quickly the two of us grew close. We broke the ""no-contact rule"" once we had both been released and in late Feb. of 2021, we began to date. 

Side Note: Yes people, I know now that every decision I just mentioned WAS A HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE ONE. 

Anyways, I had only been 16 at the time and T had told me that she was 15 and a freshman in HS. T had been sent to a foster home, but absolutely despised it. But she never had a good enough reason to be removed from the home, so eventually it led to her claiming her and I had became intimate. Now that statement alone wouldn't be that terrible....if she hadn't lied to me about her age. She told me she had just turned 15, when in reality she was just about to turn 14. Even though I was only 16, this sent me into a hysteria for 2 reasons. 1. Me and her never had intercourse. I was adamant that we waited until after a few months of serious dating as I only want to be sexual with someone if I didnt mean to spend my life with them and 2. I was scared as shit that nobody would believe me.

Luckily, it was very quickly proved evident she was lying. But the damage had already been done to me as it took a year of therapy to get over it. If she does somehow find this post, I do want her to know that I hope she is doing alright. In her defense, her foster parent was a p*do, it just hurt I had to get taken down in the process.

Anyways, fast forward to September of '22. Things had seemed to get better. I had been through countless different medications, lost about 70 pounds, was back to playing basketball after my knee healed up, and was getting better. After my 18th birthday, me and a girl (who I will refer to as Jane) started dating. Well, technically started dating for the second time, as we had been together a couple months before we mutually separated to work on ourselves. 

Jane was the love of my life. Whereas I am the quiet, calm, and sensitive guy, she was the chatterbox, extroverted, and tough girl. On top of her amazing personality, she was...and still is...drop dead gorgeous. She was who I lost my virginity to. Who I talked to the most. And who I have cared about more than anybody. I wanted to spend my life with her. But paradise only lasted nearly 6 months, when out of the blue, she broke up with me claiming she wasn't ready to be in a relationship.

It started 2023 off in the worst way, and it has only gotten worse. I started having a nicotine addiction. I started eating fewer than 1000 calories most days, sometimes having less than 5k in a week, totaled my car in a wreck, and most recently had to unenroll from college due to having multiple safety concerns placed on me by campus police.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

My mother has been the most supportive in my life, but she is getting exhausted by my attempts at suicide. I have 3 in total so far, and she is getting frustrated. My friends don't even really talk to me anymore. And I feel myself dying. I don't sleep, I don't eat. And my daily workouts went from 3 hours, 6 days a week to 1 hour 5 days a week. And now, it's maybe an hour and a half once a week. I'm lethargic. I don't feel anything.

In a way, I feel like I'm just a host for some parasite, where I'm alive, but I'm not.

I don't fear stuff like spiders or snakes or bad weather. I fear what effect my death may have on my family, more importantly, my mom who has already lost one son. 

I don't know what you call what I'm feeling. I don't want to die. I just have no reason to live.
I had a reason when I was with Jane. I had a reason when I got accepted to college and to play sports collegiately. I had a reason when I survived my original suicide attempt.

I don't know y'all. Hopefully I don't catch any hate for probably small problems compared to most. It's like I said, I hate that I feel like this with seemingly so simple of problems. Just wanted to see what some people think. Would prefer anymore personal questions to just be dm'ed to me.

Thanks, and hope yall have a good night",1
I just get worse,"I never thought I would come to this. I’ve actually genuinely started to plan my suicide. I’ve deteriorated over the course of a year from someone who could never see the sense in killing themselves because life is beautiful. To someone who doesn’t even fight against the thoughts and now i just listen to them because im tired of trying and having nothing work i might as well try something new. 

Im not going to act on my plan the moment i’ve made it im just gonna keep it in my head. And then eventually i will do it because i can’t see myself getting any better I can’t deny it it’s gonna creep up on me.",1
Running hot tonight,"Let’s preface this post by saying that I won’t delete what I write. I’ll hold myself to that.

I’m running hot. Hateful. Angry. I’m reinventing and finding myself. I have been. All these minor joyful moments come with a sour taste in my mouth.

I spent my birthday, their birthday, thanksgiving, Halloween, 4th of July, two exes’ bdays (both broke up less than a year ago however total dating time over adult life for both was about 4 years apiece) and missed my only sibling’s 40th bday as well. Even my parent’s bday. I’m going to miss Xmas. I’ve been alone this whole while.

My phone remains silent. No communication.  Partially my fault as I’ve gone LC and NC with many people. Work has cut hours. I tried to help someone with a drug problem. I’ve no one to talk to anymore. I even abandoned all social media including my main Reddit account as of last December.

I guess im just venting. But it’s hard not to feel cold and alone. 

Rediscovering music and media over the quiet moments make me want to share them. But to who? 

I remember helping someone who has kids through their divorce and using the words from one piece - I would say “I know you’ve lost so much, but look at your hands. Remember what you have left.” And I genuinely helped them through the grief until they decided to return to their life.

I say that to say this. I look at my hands and see nothing but me. I have nothing left. All I have left is a plushy fox named Jardin (garden in French) that I vent to on my seven mile round trip walk to work sometimes. He stays in my back bag maybe to just keep myself accountable. I had dogs before - I’d never end my life bc of them and with Jardin I can trick myself into feeling responsible.

I have nothing and no one. I’m starting to feel like I’ll crack one day. With temperatures dropping into that 30s Fahrenheit, I have to find a new job. I haven’t been eating more than once a day bc I can’t afford it either. Things are dire.

It’s time to start seriously considering what I’ve known for awhile. I’ll either sink or swim. My ex - I’d lift them up and say a 10 knows a 10. But with each week I’m getting more beat down. It’s been maybe four months since I got a text from someone besides work.

Surely. Surely life has to offer more. But I can’t keep on this path. I don’t want to quit. I’m a fucking amazing person. I want to laugh and have fun. Life is so wonderful. But I can’t reach the surface and am drowning. I am a seven time survivor of failed attempts, and a  DV and SA survivor as well.

I just want my forever person or to look at my hands and see what I have beyond me. I’ve never been alone like this. It’s toxic as hell. I know I have a way out. I don’t want it though. All I want is to go home to my ex. It’s been over a year since that day. Yet. I still see them in my mind perfectly. I know they’ve moved on - surely. But. It’s all I want. 18 years of them in my life, I know they’re my twinflame or purple person or soul mate. If I could learn to be okay on my own or find someone new… but idk. I’m tired now. Even if no one reads this, I’m not going to quit yet. I don’t see a way out though. 

Thanks for letting me vent.",1
I truly don't know what to do anymore.,"I've let myself go. My hair looks like a mess, I'm overweight, I'm doing poorly in school. I have a porn addiction, It's hard to sleep. I've started to become paranoid about everything. If my friend hangs up from a call I constantly check to see if he's with my other friend pushing me away. I have a weird addiction to lying (nothing that crazy). I'll lie about the littlest things. I'm sitting here writing this out at 1:37 am in the dark lmfao. What the fuck am I supposed to do. I have few friends, my family situation is in a weird place. I want to talk to someone but theres not alot of counselors near me. They don't do anything anyway. Anywhere or anyone I wanna talk to knows who I am and I constantly feel like they will talk shit about me behind my back. The only person who doesn't know what I look like is muslim and believes tht people who commit suicide go to hell.

Everyone just fucking lie,"I started an online chat with the local hot line about 2ish hours ago, i was on my way home from work, and i had enoght of it all, i planed on going up to the roof and jump, and i told the hotline worker that

We talked, for over an hour, but we didn't make alot of progress other then making me feel shitty that i might hurt thd ppl in my life, even thou honestlly, i don't even give a fuck about most of them at this point, and aventually i got to the appartment and went up to the roof, i set near the aedg, and i told her that

Shd told me we have time, we can talk, she can stay with me, but i need to get off the roof, i tried terning to other metters, even thou the roof is a dangures place rn, it's also a calming place for me, i want to stay up there to talk and calm down, but she wouldn't have that, if i want to talk i needed to get off the roof

Eventually i did, and i thought we where going to talk, she was going to help me, but she just said the hot line havs alot of other callers and she needs to leave. She said we could talk if i get off the roof, thn left as soon as i did

I think i might go up there again, not to calm down this time",1
"If my dog dies, I’ll go with him.","Things are bad right now. Reminiscent of my suicide attempt several years ago bad.

I struggle with my physical and mental health on a daily basis. When I’m not plagued by nausea, my body is in constant aches and pains. I can’t afford to see any doctors right now and have been off my mood stabilisers since August. I have been unemployed for 6 months, 100+ job applications and several job interviews have gone nowhere. I won’t be able to make rent at the end of the month and I’m very close to maxing out my credit cards, which I’ve been using to survive. On top of it all, I am a college student and I am completely overwhelmed by several final projects and final exams in the following two weeks. 

But I am at my breaking point due to my elderly dog, who I adopted when he was nearly 15 (because his previous guardian wouldn’t release him). Everyone assumes that, because he is nearly 16, I must have had him for all that time. I haven’t, but I love him as if I had. Just last week, my partner and I celebrated his one year anniversary with us at home. However, he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in March of this year, on top of having kidney disease and a thyroid condition, and it’s been getting worse this last month. His cough is getting more phlegmy, most certainly due to the fluid build up. I see him struggle. I dread that his time is coming soon. And I won’t be able to keep living in this hell with him gone. I doubt I’d even be able to pass some of my classes if it happens within the next two weeks. He’s my son, my best friend, and I am going with him when he goes.",1
Post-Breakup,"For context, im 18 male, and have struggled with social anxiety and depression my entire life. I also struggle with a disorganized mind and major mood swings between days. Ive seeked therapy and I cant say it was the most helpful thing in the world. Im extremely self aware, to a fault, and understand where the issue is and how i can go about fixing it. Its just mostly my social anxiety that gets in the way of making connections. 

But anyways, I was in my first ever relationship for a year and a half. We started dating nearing the end of junior summer, and it was amazing. They moved in within 4 months of us dating to get away from their toxic family and thats where things began going down hill. They struggle with bpd and would often have episodes of anger and aggression and often times I was the outlet. I struggled with jealousy as a result due to them only seemingly being able to be consistent and steady with friends and best friends. I always got them at their worst, except every other day. I tried communicating with them, making myself heard, and during those times they would listen, but inevitablly regress. Fast forward to october of this year, and they decided nothing was working and we would continue being incompatible, and broke it off. 

I dont have any friends, and my only connection was them. They were my rock and my love. I havent been able to sleep for 5 hours straight for the past month and a half and ive been taking up many substances, from shrooms to marijuana. My grades are slipping and I haven't been motivated to try in this past month. Ive been starting to idealize suicide all day. It doesnt help that i have major fomo when it comes to them cuz they have friends and support. We were in love but they ultimately left, had a place figured out, and a lot of support from a previous mutual friend group that I actually tried reconnecting with but inevitably got no response back. I cant will myself to mute them because I always end up unmuting them on socials and e stalking. They have a lot of trauma and has been in a lot of relationships. We had a talk a week after the breakup because i felt there was zero closure and for somebody that influential in my life to leave, it shattered me. 

They explained that I was the best person they ever ever been with, the most loving and affectionate. And basically that it was them that needed therapy and to not be with anybody at the moment because relationships trigger their defense responses. We cried for an hour embracing eachother. Eventually they left. We stayed in contact for a week or so after that, but eventually ended communication all together. Ever since then, i have found so much struggle trying to move on with my life. After experiencing love for the first time in my life, intimacy for the first time in my life, and just a person I could be my utmost self with for the first time in my life, I now feel empty and depressed. I have been grappling with thoughts of anger with them but I always end up remembering the good times and feel like crying for hours on end. I feel abandoned and used, but also understand their struggle and emotions. As someone I was with for a year and a half, I know them like the back of my hand, and understand the mental turmoil they must be in. But its so hard to feel sympathy for the person that hurt you, yknow? No matter their reasoning. Ive been trying to forgive them in my head, but I always end up holding on to that bit of spite.

To reiterate, I have no friends. I have no license. And my college's clubs dont have much flexibility in terms of my schedule. I just feel empty and hopeless. Just constant dread and a pit in my stomach every second of the day. I have some moments of clarity and motivation builds up but I inevitablly think myself into a thought loop and get depressed all over again. 

My family has taken noticed and have been extremely nice to me for the past month. Even my brother, whom I always have had a rocky relationship with, invited me to a hangout with a few of his close friends for a smoke sesh and fish which was really refreshing and a nice bonding experience with my brother. But the second we got home, and I hit the hay, I felt that dread come back and its so difficult.

Ik im having extreme suicidal ideation due to the fact I feel at peace whenever I think about how I could commit suicide and when I could. Even having an extremely depressing episode in the middle of school, researching the highest verticle drops in my state to commit suicide at. I dont know what im doing anymore, and I feel lost. 

I have always struggled with negative feelings, and even have in the past given some thought to suicide, but then i had more motivation in my academics and a clear path forward to making friends and such. This is different. Im genuinely contemplating suicide and Ive never been so down on the dumps in my entire life. I feel desolate. And I dont know how to cope. I feel as tho im whithering away, and i feel as though I cant keep going. I've started developing an eating disorder as well where I cant physically stomach a meal for more than 10 minutes and end up feeling like im gonna throw up. Ive lost 10 pounds and i cant will myself to hit the gym and start bulking.

Its so deabilitating and I dont want to die, and I really dont think I would be able to commit to the act even if I had the resources, but I just want this suffering to end. 

I might sound edgy, melodramatic due to my age and inexperience, but if this is my way of reaching out, from posting this anynomous message on the internet, then im gonna do it. Thank you and hope yall all have a good day.",1
BPD is ruining my life.,"I have a tendency to have a favorite person and my FP told me that he had actually been cheating on his girlfriend with me the entire time. He told me he loved me and wanted to be exclusive, and the day after he dropped me. I had no idea he was in a relationship but literally ever since he told me my life has been a downward spiral. I started cutting myself again, my medicine isn’t working, I’m anxious and obsessive, and I’m about to fail this semester of college because I’ve been so obsessed with the whole situation. Nobody’s helping me. They all think I’m crazy or obsessive or a shitty person. I don’t think I’m a good person either but this is really pushing me over the edge and I feel like I should just end it all. I’ve been having a hard time because I have to get rid of all my stuff so my family doesn’t have to deal with it but when I try to go through it I feel stupid for killing myself over a guy. It really isn’t just because he left me but it’s triggered such a downward spiral and I feel like there’s no coming out of this",1
Complete hopelessness,"I don't know what to do these days. I used to cope by fantasizing or daydreaming but I've reached a stage where I don't have that delusion anymore.

I've only gotten progressively dumber as I've gotten older. I have no motivation or hope for fixing anything at all, I just want it to be over.",1

A rational take on depression and this bullshit life.,"New to Reddit, 29F. I’ve been increasingly suicidal over the last few weeks and have come to the conclusion that, taking the emotion out of it, it makes complete sense and would be humane for me to die. 

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, OCPD, chronic depression, and severe anxiety. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for literally as far back as I have memories (around 5). I also have a chronic illness that is largely misunderstood/not cared about, even by doctors, which also causes mental health issues, among other problems. 

I won’t bore you with my personal traumas, but they’re there. I don’t have irrational thoughts about my partner or family being better off without me or that no one cares—I know they love me and that they’ll be sad I’m not here. I’m just tired of suffering. I’m tired of feeling exhausted. Of never resting because almost every night I’m plagued with nightmares. Of my chronic illness rendering me unable to complete even small tasks without pain. Of my inner voice/chronic PTSD constantly reminding me of anything that has caused me emotional pain. Of this world crushing my spirit and willingness to have any desire to even leave my house, not just because I’m depressed but because every time I do I have to be vigilant of gun violence, horrible car accidents, sexual assault, etc. 

I don’t want help. I just want my loved ones to understand that it’s inhumane for me to stay here, suffering every single day. I wish society would get off its controlling high horse and let me die with some damn dignity. I’ve been in pain for so long that I don’t want to self-inflict anymore. I don’t want my husband to bear the trauma of finding my body. I just want to have an amazing day with him, say goodbye, and go to sleep. Even dogs are afforded this luxury. 

Guess I just wanted to vent, as I have no one I can speak to about this that will understand because they love me and want me to overlook all these feelings. Thanks for reading.",1
I feel selfish about wanting to die,"Is my second time writting here, it has helped me to vent a lot since the first time, and I feel very grateful for the kind comments.
 
So, I just want to talk about something on my mind.

Long short story: I have literally a perfect life, with lovely parents, a wonderful boyfriend, awesome Friends and really good grades. 

The thing? I really want to die deep inside me.

There's a constant feeling of fear and dispair about the future, and every morning costs me like, a lot to just be a decent person.

Basically, no one knows that I have a big depression inside me, beside the obvious simptopms like how dificult higiene might be for me, or the Big mess that my room is, or the constant lack or sudden outburst of energy.

And I don't fucking know why

My life is awesome, and I don't understand this constant feeling of wanting to die so badly. 

It's my first tought on the mornings, everyday.

And I feel very guilty and selfish

I feel like I am so ungrateful because of these toughts

I really don't have idea what's the problem and I feel confused and scared.

Is like, I love my life, but life itself...

It tires me.

I just want to sleep forever.",1
love,"why do people use me for my body, for my love, squeeze every drop of me out and leave me cold lifeless with my wrists in the drain",1
im such a failure,"i tried to kms. i was crying and writing notes. i poured my heart out. i couldn’t press hard enough to do anything, i was too scared, or something. i can’t fucking believe it i’m just failing at everything. i tried to get clean from self harm and i fucked up and was shitty to my friends. it was all i could think about and wanted to do, i had to fight off multiple anxiety attacks. idfk i went thru withdrawal or some shit so idk what i’m gonna do. how am i suppose to stop knowing it fucks me up like that? how am i supposed to not want to die knowing i’m so broken? anyways. i just don’t want to be here anymore, it’d be so much easier for everyone involved. idk why i came here. i just want someone to see me for once",1
I don’t know where to turn,"I think I’ve had suicidal thoughts from as young as like 7 or 8? I just never had goals or ambitions. I never wanted to go to college, couldn’t see myself being committed to a job or passion for the rest of my life, etc. I’ve had bad stuff happen to me (who hasn’t) and honestly I can kinda just summarize those thoughts of not having any ambition turn into anxiety inducing thoughts and just complete lack of motivation to go on. Life has been rough but fast forward to this year (I’m now 22) I lost my sister from an accidental overdose. She was my best friend and we both lived together and I never experienced loss on this scale. Not to mention I was the one to find her dead, I’ve been in a whole world of hurt. Her death brought up a lot of issues with my family and their complete disdain for me so I’ve also been dealing with childhood wounds on top of an already painful era of my life. As you can imagine my whole world came to a stop when my sister died and I was in the last semester of college and my dad forced me to finish my semester while also grieving. He’s not proud of me for having my degree and him and my family talk shit that I haven’t gone for my masters or I don’t have a real “job”. Depression and anxiety are not valid things for me to experience in my families eyes. I am in a relationship but my boyfriend isn’t caring towards me. He is difficult to communicate with and I feel like he can be really uncaring at times about my situation. I just don’t really care anymore. I feel like my entire life I’ve been completely shitted on by everyone around me and have almost always been alone. Just this past month both my grandfather and stepmom were diagnosed with cancer and I don’t think I can handle any more grief at all in my life. I feel awful leaving my dad behind or having him be the one to find me (despite my therapist saying I have PTSD from the night I found my sister and my dad kind of laughed at me) but I truly have no motivation to go on. I feel like people will actually care or take me serious if I’m gone (but I’ll be gone so does it matter). So this is basically my story. I don’t have much else to turn to as my therapy was only through my school when I was a student and my dad gives me a hard time about using our insurance for appointments. Advice would be nice but honestly I don’t really even know what I’m looking for anymore. Maybe hope?",1

I'm so sick of living for other people.,"I've been suicidal since I'm very young. I've had countless hospitalizations at psych wards for months on end and even attended an alternative BOCES school for psychiatric issues. I've taken care of my 2 disabled siblings my entire life. Think of two 6 year olds that never grow up, forever  parenting them. My parents are idiots who I've had to parent my whole life. My mom is severely naive and my dad is an alcoholic asshole. I'm addicted to fentanyl and just want to kill myself already but I know it would devastate my mom and my siblings who depend on me. My boyfriend is the only person I see because we do drugs together. He doesn't understand depression or anxiety and is severely emotionally handicapped. He's basically empty inside and I know we don't belong together but the drugs keep us together. I used to do dope, but inadvertently got addicted to fentanyl once it came on the scene and is just a staple now, added to almost every drug. I'm also afraid of what sort of afterlife I'd experience if I killed myself. Suicidal ideation is such a low vibration state. I don't want to enter a realm made entirely of fear and self loathing, devoid of God's embrace and love. I wish God would just take me. My emotional hurdles and severe mental illness is now manifesting itself physically and my stomach is so bad I have a metallic taste in my mouth for days now, it's disgusting. I've also been fighting to get disability payments for 3 years and my attorney doesn't know what he's doing and if course I got the judge that is all over the internet as someone who denies deserving individuals their disability. I'm just so sad and frustrated. I am at a loss for words or actions. Thanks for letting me rant.",1

I just can’t anymore.,"Since I can remember I’ve struggled with my anxiety, bipolar and depression. And it just seems to get worse each and everyday. I’ve always had the feeling that I am worthless, useless, not important, just taking up space and air. I didn’t have a bad childhood or messed up parents I have a loving family and I feel bad for always feeling this way. But in the last few years I’ve been fighting myself lying to myself telling myself I can and was doing better but I’m not, I’m ready to end it all. I don’t feel appreciated or loved by my husband I feel like a burden to him, I can feel that he hates me and I haven’t been the best partner granted we were young when we moved in together and started dating and then got married(within 3 years). I just want to feel loved or worthy of his time. I don’t know, maybe I’m just being stupid, but who cares cause I don’t, I’ve just wanted to die for so long, just can’t bring myself to do it. It’d be so much better if I were to get hit by a car or something or like never wake up again.

(Which no one does.) Hardly anyone checks up on me nor wants to talk to me and when people do talk to me it’s always sum they NEED.  I honestly have no one to talk to besides this.  I am a 15 year old girl who doesn’t go out much I don’t socialize like others, which I’ll admit I should be doing better instead of laying in bed but it’s like I fall right back down and get that lonely feeling once again like a loop sum like that? 
I just wish to talk to someone who is actually interested. I hate when people are forced to talk to me makes me feel absolutely shitty.
At school I’m constantly made fun of I have hardly any friends at school I only have one friend which is out of school. I have thought about ending my life many times, feeling as if I wasn’t needed or that I was some parasite to people. I make people annoyed of me.

I only exist when needed otherwise I am just a background. Even if I do get close to someone I am aggressive I can get random outburst which I really don’t mean. I honestly can’t keep one person close without ruining shit.

Update,"I posted about a month ago. After I made the post the next day my roommate got back from over seas and couldn’t find his weed (funny thing is before he left he asked me for weed so I assumed he had none). He began accusing me to taking it (news flash I didn’t). He kept saying I owed him 30$ or 1/8 of weed. I kept telling him I didn’t take it and the dude straight up charged me and tried to throw me out my bedroom window on the third floor so I defended my self. When he finally fucked off I locked my door and began trying to calm down (I’m a trauma survivor with ptsd/cptsd) by the time my breathing exercises were over and called the cops he already called them and told them I attack him. They arrested me and charged me. While I was in the cell I was served a restraining order. I was kicked out of my apartment and the locks were changed. So now I’m homeless. I was able to get the restraining order dropped because the police report did not match the affidavit and I took pictures of bruises I got in the assault that were not consistent to both the police report or the affidavit (because the dudes a liar).I still have to go to court however for the criminal charge. I keep being told it should end up getting dropped but honestly I don’t care. Ever since the attack I have not been able to get out of survival mode. I’m tired, so fucking tired and no one seems to understand how badly this has effected me. 

I have acquired a bunch of xans from someone (enough to kill a horse or two). I plan on taking them all and washing them back with some rum or whatever I can get. This wasn’t my ideal method but it’s what I got. Other wise I can just hang myself. I honestly hope this method works. I really don’t want to live anymore, and just want it all to be over.",1

Drifting along,"Hello. I never really post on Reddit but i feel like this is where I'll get the most human answers. 

For context I attempted when i was 17 (21 now) and I did multiple years with a great therapist who I loved and multiple years with a psychiatrist. I also did the recommended outpatient program after I got out of the hospital because I was drunk/high when I was admitted. Basically all of the ""right things"" were done but I'm not where I should be in a sense. I have a support system between work, my partner, and sister. 

For a while before I actually attempted, I would just wish for death. Ex) that a car will hit me head on, die in my sleep, die in a freak accident. I didn't want to crash my own car or something like that because I didn't want my family to have to deal with the aftermath. I felt like I was waiting for it until it came. 

Now I feel the same but different. I don't want to kill myself but I still feel like I'd be better off gone.  I know people love me but it doesn't seem to be worth it. I feel like I'm just existing because I hate being alive and constantly having to deal with bullshit. Logically in my head, it makes more sense to just die so I don't have to deal with things anymore. So many shitty things are happening in the world, let alone my own life, so it doesn't make sense to me how some people want to be alive.

Someone posted about things not getting better when people tell you so, and that's also another frustration I have. I'm so angry all the time and it hasn't stopped since I was released; it just shows in different forms.  I'm tired of people telling me it will get better because it hasn't. I'm alive but I'm tired of it and I'm only 21. I don't know how I'm supposed to make it past 25. I guess my question is, why do some people actually want to live?",1
Honestly a very typical life of a 22 year old ( im sorry this is so long),"I’m 22F, in college FT, working, just to give some context. I guess I’m not super sure about making this post, so bear with me. this is going to be VERY LONG, so I don’t blame anyone who doesn’t read it.

I think a big problem I’ve been facing is overwhelming guilt and shame for who I am and who I’ve become recently. I don’t believe I’m a blatantly bad person, but I think I’ve just become fundamentally unlikeable and have so many problems in my life that I never am interesting/enough for others. I feel myself hardening because after putting in what I think is buckets of effort and genuine care for other people, I haven’t gotten much back. I know everyone is going to be like “well those aren’t your TRUE friends” but I’ve had some of these friends for over a decade and weve been by each other’s sides for the whole time. I recently had what I thought was a brief conflict with a very close friend, that we both agreed was both of our responsibilities and something we would work on so we could continue to grow our friendship, but after basically stopped interacting with me altogether. This has caused me to lose my connections with all but one person in the social group we are in, not with hostility, but just silence. None of them know anything about my life right now, or how I am doing, and most of them forgot my birthday a few months ago. Other friends have just done similarly, or are not authentic with me.   


I really have only ever wanted people to be honest with me, and I always tell people if there’s an issue or they have a problem with something I have said or did, to just talk to me about it and we can try to come to some resolution about it. I am open to learn and grow from my mistakes, always. But they never do. I’m stuck with ended friendships that are confusing and not concluded and so touch and go, and it literally drains me so much I want to die. I think I try to be pretty self reflective and I’ve had a lot of low points in my life that I’ve learned from but I’m so stuck  in this ditch and i have no idea how to get out. I’m so lonely and so hateful towards myself because I dont have any way to try and rejuvenate these connections that I care so much about. I actively listen to people and continually express my love and appreciation for them and am consistently let down.

not to mention that the rest of my life is a shambled mess, kinda. Im in school and I like my choices for my career but I’m so worried about finances that I can’t focus on what I’m doing or looking forward to. I’m so so poor, and not in a quirky college kid way. I support myself completely except for my health insurance, and have no backing if something goes wrong. If I end up in the hospital or get fired or kicked out of school, I’m completely screwed, because my parents are poor too. That pressure makes living so hard, and no one else that I am surrounded by understands that because I live amongst the wealthy (northeast US). I literally cannot look more than a week ahead of me because I don’t know if I’ll have enough money for the next one. I don’t have any more free hours that I can fill with work, and my hours at my current job are inconsistent, so I have no way of budgeting myself. I also can’t go and do any things with my few friends I do have because of time and money, so that makes the connections even worse. I am not able to tell this to anyone because for some reason my generation loves to just be like “ omg lol same girl” like huh?? Such a weird way to react to serious conversation.

my mental health is, well, terrible, which anyone reading this probably could’ve guessed. History of SA, bullying, abuse, alcoholic mother, blah blah. Sounds insensitive but everyone goes through something so I try not to use it to justify me feeling a certain way, but it all definitely contributes to it. I find myself masking how I feel almost 100% of the time, and I put a lot of energy into helping others feel better that I don’t have a ton of space for helping myself. Dad is the only one who I can talk to but he has a large helping of life problems too, so I always feel extremely guilty venting to him. 

one last thing lol, I know this is long, if you’re reading this still I am thankful for your commitment to my woes. health is getting real bad. I found a lump in my armpit, and it hurts and is getting bigger. I’ve tried to do warm compress, acne stuff bc I have a history of getting pretty bad body acne sometimes, but nothing. It’s starting to feel hard and I’m scared. I’m avoiding the doctor because if this turns into a problem, it’ll be too much financially on me and my family, so I just ignore it. part of me I think is hoping it’ll just be the worst case scenario and I can die without knowing what it is or whatever. Does that make me sick in the head? Probably. Lowkey starting to get back into habits from my ED too so that’s cool. I have terrible tmd and chronic neck pain from a past sports injury, and Im so tired all the time, but yet again, I somewhat hide this from everyone, which is definitely part of the problem.

don’t even get me started on the state of the world rn either, it’s putting me In a spiral bc I can’t do anything to help, but I won’t get into that.

all this being said, kinda wanna die rn! I won’t do it, it'd be terrible for my parents so I can’t do that to them. I’m literally living for others sakes. I have no thrill for life, I am just moving through everything because if I stop I’ll be done forever. I miss being happy and loved and excited, and not anxious about every micro interaction I have with people or every cent I spend. It’s fing exhausting.

so yeah…no money for therapy unfortunately, so this is it. I’m gonna keep living, but it’s just very very hard to do so. I don’t feel like a real person anymore, like my life isnt even my own. I know in my heart I’m a good person, and I love people so deeply, but it hurts very bad to love now. I’ve grown bitter, and I hate that. I miss having a dog, she loved me probably more than I loved her. I love being alive but this isn’t the life I want and I don’t have a way out. I’m really trying guys but I’m starting to kinda just fall apart.  
if anyone even attempts to get this far down, literally how and also thank you.",1
Is anyone up,Can I talk to anyone tonight,1
Why am so broken?,Why? I don’t have any trauma and I had a mostly normal upbringing. Then my mental health slowly started to decline when I was 13 and then completely went to shit when I was 17. I don’t even know why. Why do I have to be such a broken mess?,1
.,in the hospital for overdosing wish i took more and didn't call an ambulance. really wanna be fucking dead,1
I want to kill myself but I'm too scared,"I daydream about sitting on my bed, an empty bottle of Advil in my hand, ready to die, to just, get out of this fucking world full of pain. For the past 10 months, I've been struggling mostly every day and I'm tired of it. But I can't bring myself to commit suicide. I think about it, and then I think about the pain I'll bring my family and friends. I can't imagine them finding me on the ground with a note next to me, then calling the police and finding out that I'm dead. I can't do that to them, especially since I'm young. Nothing is getting better. I can't do anything productive and I've failed. This won't end. Ever. Waking up every day, knowing I have to get out of my fucking bed and face another fucking day. I know people care about me. So I've decided that I'm just gonna fucking live in this fucking fucked up world one day at a fucking time.

PS: The reason why my account is so young is because my main account got banned, so go figure.",1
I’m ready now. I’ve lost hope in society. I hate this world and I’m fucking done.,"My birthday is in three weeks. I am supposed to turn twenty but I never will. At college, the whole Israel and Palestine stuff is really getting to me. Im prepared to get hate on here too. Bring it on. Honestly, it will just add more motivation. I’m Jewish. We have one Jewish state and that is the state of Israel. There are people that believe that the holocaust never existed… it blows my fucking mind. These same people are supporting Hamas. Hamas has declared that their purpose on earth is to destroy us. People at college are constantly protesting “free Palestine”. I just want everyone on all sides (not Hamas ofc) to just live in unity and peace and love. That will never happen. Tonight I got angry when the independent student newspaper came out with an article saying that the student body at my school is in support of Palestine… I am obviously upset about this because it doesn’t apply to everyone. A few weeks ago, someone put up graphic images and posters outside of the dining hall. They were taken down but nothing else was done about this. I have some friends who hold the same beliefs and morals that I do… however it seems as though I’m doing the absolute most to let my voice be heard in a nonviolent way. I commented a response on the student newspapers post about this narrative and how it is offensive. I got into some heated arguments… I’m a sensitive individual who is angry and I did this to myself obviously. I know that I’m hurting because my chest feels like someone dropped a piano on me and the tears are coming out and the rocking won’t stop. I’m stimming like crazy. I want to uncap the bottle of Wellbutrin and disappear. There is no hope for humanity. Nothing I do or nothing my people will do is going to help anything. I’ve lost friends because of this shit. They hate me. If the world is going to be so hateful and support a terrorist organization, I’m out. I can’t fucking do this anymore. I’m waiting for one of the commenters to tell me to kill myself. That’s my signal.  Goodbye.",1
I lost my partner of ten years,"This is sort of a venting post. It's been hard coping with all that's happened since the 22nd.

He said he was going to an appointment and I offered to drive him. He said he could get there and liked going on his quests. I had to sleep for work that night so he joined me in bed as I held him. Then he left. I was drowsy and barely noticed. Saw him all dressed, looking at me before he walked out the door. I didn't get to hug him or give him kisses. He always demanded three. I ended up going back to sleep. 

I woke up a few hours later and realized he still wasn't home and I had no messages from him. He was prone to getting lost easily. I called and messaged him, hoping for a response. Nothing. Endless ringing and then voicemail.

He was found Thanksgiving day. 

I don't know how to get through this other than talking about it and therapy/meds. The loss is so devastating. I love him so much and regret all the bad times and unfinished plans, yet treasuring every single second we ever had together despite it all.

I told him how much I feared being alone here. He was my everything. I love you, Ryan. So much it hurts.",1
3 years,That’s how much longer I intend to live for. I figure I can cut off everyone in my life within that time and save up for a quick way to end it. I’ve traveled the world already and done the things I wanna do already and nobody needs me so I don’t see a point in living,1
I don’t know what to do anymore,"Just as a warning, all my thoughts are very unorganized and I can’t really find the will to organize them here so it’s just gonna be a shitty dump.

I’ve felt stuck between a rock and a hard place for what feels like forever. I’m 17, almost 18 and everything just kinda feels like shit. For years it’s just felt like I push away all my friends and people I care about, I feel so lonely and I want a relationship but I’m an awkward dude who weighs 230 lbs and no matter what I do I feel like people just don’t think I look good. I try to put myself out there but somehow it always goes wrong in the most absurd ways possible. I can’t lose weight by any conventional methods so I’m stuck on medicines that I have to take because the doctor says I could be facing diabetes. I have fucked up so many relationships and even now I see some of my closest people fading away because I don’t try or they’re too busy. All the people who are my friends are either just graduated and now trying to live their adult lives or younger than me and about to be left behind. I feel so stressed all the time, I’m smart but I wish I wasn’t sometimes because it just feels like there’s always expectations on me. I’m a few credits away from graduating highschool with my AA degree but it feels like a struggle to get to the end and I’ve been talked up so much that it feels like if I fall short I’ll just be a failure. I want to reach out to people but I just can’t find the words because I’ve always put on an act to seem fine and put together but inside I’m just crumbling. I thought about reaching out to old friends to maybe catch up, apologizing to some people who I felt I’ve wronged, telling the girl I like how I feel, but I’m too much of a coward to do any of those things. I had a dream last night about reaching out to someone I haven’t talked to in a long time and getting closure for how I left things and I woke up and just cried by myself in my room. It feels like everything I like even just in a general sense feels stale. On top of everything I’m confident in saying I’ve formed a porn addiction, I keep trying to stop but it’s just kinda the default because it’s the one thing that’s supplying me with any form of dopamine. It feels like I’m always either stressing about school, lying in bed because I’m always tired, or holed up in my room staring at screens. I’ve thought about ending it a lot and I can’t even bring myself to try that because I’m such a coward. I’ll look at ledges and just casually think about jumping over it and it feels like one day I’m just gonna autopilot and do it. I want to be alive but there’s nothing in my life keeping me there besides my cat, and even that’s risky because it’s technically my older sisters cat and she keeps saying she’ll take her away some day. That’ll probably be the day I end it tbh. 

I’m not writing anymore, because if I do the post will probably never end, so yea. I know I didn’t even hit all the things I want to say but I don’t have the energy go look inside myself to find them, and if I go any further I’m probably just gonna trash the post all together. I fucking hate everything",1
I need someone to talk to. Anyone. Pls and thank u...,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/184tw29/i_need_someone_to_talk_to_anyone_pls_and_thank_u/,1
Need more people to talk with,"I’m just so lonely these days, I try really hard not to fuck up but I do. MY OWN DAD DID NOT TELL ME HAPPY THANKSGIVING, it’s sad and it hurts my feelings. But I don’t expect to be here anymore on my birthday, which is the New Year. So idk anymore",1
Tired.,"I feel sick and tired tired of everything. I don’t like to think of myself because when I do it makes me freak out but recently it’s been on my mind and it makes me hate myself more. When I think about it Im Not a great person I hold grudges, I make people consistently angry at me, I just do things that aren’t good. I have 0 redeeming qualities that I can think of I literally serve no purpose on this world except to just piss people off and then die ig. Sure some people say they like me and my presence but that’s temporary they always get tired of me and I don’t blame them I’m tired of myself. All I do all day is wallow in my own self pity and then bitch about it. I know what I’m doing is annoying yet I can’t bring myself to do anything else and I know it’s getting old. I cant enjoy anything anymore I’ve been trying to get into my old interests to idk maybe make me feel better but it doesn’t it doesn’t make me feel anything I just feel bored and that makes me feel horrible. I cant stop thinking about just killing myself and getting it over with so I don’t have to keep doing this but I know I won’t because I’m too scared to so I’m just stuck with it constantly going through my head and it’s exhausting and pathetic honestly. And the thing is I don’t even know why I’m telling anyone about this it’s not like it makes anything about it better, I mean yeah it’s nice typing this out and getting my feeling down on text but at the end of the day no matter what I fucking do it’s not going to change it. I go to therapy, I talk about how I feel there and nothing changes I feel the same after, I try the things people say help and it never does. I’ve tried medication and every one I’ve been on has not helped, or it’s made me sick or made my anxiety worse which then made me feel more shitty. I don’t know I’m just tired of this stupid existence. I don’t know why I had to be born, I’m going to die anyways I don’t get what the point is if everyone I know is going to die and earth explodes.",1

Born wrong for this world I guess,"I can’t cope with anything, too weak to continue . I tried so fucking hard. So so hard but I can never be anything. School traumatised me and made me wanna kill everyone and take there limbs and eat them and throw it up, I wanna shoot myself over and over and over and over again, I wanna eat myself to stop having a body, these words will never even slightly encapsulate how much of a hell it was. People say it’s scratching the surface of the iceberg but it’s just being up in the sky and seeing a tiny dot, not even slightly expressing how I feel I’ve already tried to explain how much it all hurts, I can’t even do that right. I can’t even cope with school, there’s no way I could survive this world something about me is just wrong I don’t wanna exist here. Anyway, I was born wrong so it’s wrong for me to even mention other people or things that I use as excuse for how revolting I just am by myself, I shouldn’t be here at all but it doesn’t matter. How much longer? How much longer must I go to be considered to have ‘tried enough’ , it seems like it’ll just turn into a whole life. I don’t wanna be like this forever , I don’t wanna be 20 and still only surviving just Rotting away, I don’t wanna I don’t wanna I know I need to change something but I can’t I feel too small, too tiny to do anything to change something, it’s all the same every second is exactly the same cycle over and over and over and over and over and over I don’t wanna live it anymore",1
I'm scared.,How do you deal with the fear of death. The finality of it??? I'm scared to shaking but I cannot do this. I might've failed because I didn't actually try I think this is it. Now I have a plan and I'm sitting right in front of it.  I just wanna talk to someone as I go?,1
I’m not after attention,"I, 16M, constantly get accused on ‘faking it for attention’ when reality is that I’ve tried to reach out but nothings worked. 

Yesterday I sat on the edge of a bridge and almost jumped but fear caught me before it happened and it made me get away. I’m constantly left alone with my thoughts and they are all saying “your worthless” and “no one will ever like you”.

I’ve suffered with trauma for mental for physical abuse for when I was 7 and it only recently stopped but the long lasting effects have already happened. My dad was the cause of it apparently I was a failure in his eyes and now every time there is a loud noise or any kind of harm I spiral into a panic attack.

I’ve told others and nothing worked. I spent 2 weeks in hospital on suicide watch but that didn’t help, I’ve also been to therapy but that only made it worse.

Sorry if it’s long but I needed to stay this before I leave this life and I wanted it off my chest. I’m probably speaking into a void but oh well. To whoever read this thanks, at least someone will know what’s happening and maybe someone can relate.",1
Help someone talk to me please,Despair is how I feel. I am 25 male going through so much. I have to end my life but the worst thing is I don’t have a sure method. Today has been my worse day ever. I have no one to talk to. Can’t talk to psychologist or therapist as I don’t wanna be sectioned. Talking  helps. Would appreciate if anyone talk to me,1
just a note,"putting my thoughts here so that they're somewhere other than my phone.

i am 21 in my last year of college. i make music. i work on the weekend at a retail chain. i know i am going to die pretty soon i just dont know when. here's some things that have happened recently in case you know me (or if you're just a stranger) and you're curious as to why.

early last year (2022) one of my closest friends and former roommate had a paranoid episode and killed himself by jumping in front of a train. i ended up living with two narcissists for a year in that apartment. one was a dude who eventually dropped out and moved across the country because he kept getting accused of mistreating women. the other was a girl who initially moved in with her girlfriend, cheated on her with my other roommate, became a coke addict and could barely hold onto a job. they were both slobs and i would be kept up sometimes by them screaming at one another. i also did not have a window in my room, i kept missing classes because i would wake up and couldnt tell if it was night or day. had a washer and dryer in unit though, which was nice.

in january (2023) i learned that another friend had overdosed and passed away earlier in the month, i only found out because someone else approached me bc they were collecting unfinished music for his parents. i wasnt the closest with him but it still fucked me up a lot especially considering i had apparently talked to him the night it happened and i didnt even know.

my long distance girlfriend of a year moved in with me in february. was really great for a couple months, living with her made the situation more bearable. stuff boiled up between her and one of my roommates which devolved into an argument and a situation wherein she (roommate) was getting drunk constantly and threatening my girlfriend. i flew her back home out of concern for her safety and reverting back to long distance was too much of a stresser so we ended up splitting. the one roommate continued harassing me each time she got drunk via phone/text until recently

interned at a notable studio in NYC over the summer for no pay. was working 3 days a week, 2 overnight from 6pm-8pm (depended on the schedule). learned a lot about being a recording engineer, got to meet a ton of cool people and got to be in the room with artists i never thought i would. on the other hand my sleep schedule was completely fucked, my resting heart rate was almost always off the charts and i was so stressed i started losing hair. kept coming in because i was falling in love with engineering and genuinely saw myself working there long-term. took a test and mock-session in september, passed and got hired as an assistant engineer. i have not stepped foot in that studio since the test and at some point realized i probably never would despite how much i wanted to be there.

in october, another friend from music let our friend-group know that he only had a few weeks to live. he was diagnosed with cancer last year, underwent a series of treatments and had been showing signs of improvement. none of us expected this news; we all dropped everything and planned a trip up to boston to see him. his mom told us that he was super excited to spend whatever time he had left hanging out and working on songs with us. right as the first people started to arrive in the city, we got the call that he passed away in his sleep. i cancelled my ticket and still have not fully processed this

i have been taking close to 20 credits worth of classes for the past 3 years. i took on way too ambitious of a thesis project. i wanted to make a documentary about the sub-genre my friends and i have been associated with online. i was really excited about it when i pitched it at the beginning of the year but i realized that im not capable of finishing something like that.  i am also president of a club/creative publication. i have been struggling to keep up with any of this and a few weeks ago i just gave up completely. i havent been submitting any assignments, ive been showing up to my thesis advising meetings and lying about my progress so that i can go back home and sleep. i have been forgetting important shit for my club and for classes and rushing to get it all done just in time for things to keep moving forward.

i dont think i have processed anything i have talked about so far really aside from being upset about it happening, because i haven't had the time to :(

i can see that i have become someone who everyone knows is unreliable. most of the friends i have left have stopped inviting me out because they know i wont show. my club board has picked up on the fact that im not in a state to run anything. im almost 6 months behind on my thesis at this point, and the people i asked to participate in it have stopped messaging me asking when interviews/work is going to happen. my apartment is a mess and i stopped eating, ive been spending the little money i have on cigarettes and dunkin donuts. walking to dunkin donuts and smoking a cigarette when i wake up is the highlight of my day and its usually downhill from there. i cant sleep. im writing this at 2am, i had 2 essays due at midnight. neither of them have been started and they will remain that way

i am tired of trying to keep up with everything. i want it to end completely. there were a couple times in my life when i (sometimes on drugs) became convinced that the only way to correct my course was to run into traffic or jump off the roof. i have felt that way every single day for the past month or so. i cant concentrate in school or work because of it, i have a breakdown and go on some self destructive adventure damn near every night before i sleep. the best part is that nobody else knows. i think people know im not doing well because people have been asking but i havent been answering. i do not want to. i appreciate the concern though

my parents and sister are really proud of me, specifically because of music. i havent told any of this to them. they know about things that have happened; they know ive had multiple friends die this year, and all the shit with my ex roommates. my family is my only reservation and its more than an annoyance than anything else. im annoyed that they have supported me in pursuing my passion, that they chose to love me every time i fucked up as a kid. i still know that i'm going to die soon. this is the only place i am putting any of this.",1

Somebody please shoot me,"If I lived in a third world country I'd be dead. When they dig up my bones, no matter how many surgeries and HRT i take, I'll be female. No matter how much I try, I will never be a biological male. I will forever have missed out on my teenage years due to my dysphoria. 

I will forever yearn to be something I can't be. People will look at me and tell me they support me, but I know they just think I'm a confused, mental woman. That I'll never be male. No matter how much I try, I will never look like the men I idolize. No matter how much I try, I will never be able to be a father. 

No matter how much I try, I'll always be AFAB. Biologically female. My parents' daughter. My siblings' sister. No matter how much I try, in the memories I fondly look upon now, I will be female. I deserve to be dead. 

Something like me, who wastes the opportunity and privilege I have to be sulking, jealous of what I will forever not be. Something like me, who could be jealous of their childhood friends, their own brother, their own father. Something like me deserves to be 6 feet underground or shot in the head with a gun.

My partner is suicidal and I don’t know how to help,"I have been trying to help but I have no idea how. We had a talk and he said that sometimes when I bring up how scared I feel about him killing himself it makes him feel ashamed and regret talking about it. It has been a on going issue for years now. I have also someone who has struggled with suicide and have even attempted, so I have tried recamending everything that helps me and I even suggest professional help every time we have a conversation, but he is very against getting a therapist sense he has seen a couple already and non have helped him. I just have no idea what to do and feel helpless. He has even tried to admit himself into a mental hospital but they wouldn’t take him due to being too high of a risk (what ever that means). I also have been spiraling a little due to feeling very scared I might find my partner dead one day. His family is aware of his mental state as well. Anytips?",1
Why can't it be easy?,"I've been feeling like this for maybe a year now. Cried so much that my eyes completely dried out for the past few months. Sometimes a little ray of sunshine gets through the clouds, but it always dissapears. It hurts to go on with life, it hurts to think about everything ahead. But most of all, it hurts to know that no matter how close I am to finally getting it over with, I'll never have the strength to actually carry it out. Its too painful, or too difficult to access, or too... ""public."" I just want to go quietly, but I can't. I love my family, no matter how much I hate them. And I don't want to leave them with all the guilt and sadness of thinking they caused it. But I can't go on. The burning feeling never gets better, but it also never gets worse. And I'm so, so tired of that feeling.  There's a lot more I wish I could mention, but it's getting late and my eyes hurt. I don't know what I was looking for here, maybe I'm just venting to random people on the internet, maybe I don't actually want help from anyone here, but I have no idea. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry.",1

It’s painful being alive, and I don’t see a purpose. People say, “You can talk to me, don’t do it” but they don’t mean it. No one would care. My arm stings and it keeps me grounded. It feels good.

Quantum living and universal reset,"God's plan is for quantum death. No matter how much I kill myself, how many times I remember it happening I wake back up. I am alive till he designates.

We will live the same lives, make the same mistakes, and we have no free will. We are in a simulation of his creation. I can't die because it's not in his programming. I remember hanging and passing out. I remember slamming my head against things till I bled. Nothing. He has taken my ability to die. I want to die and cease to exist. I want everyone I care about to be happy and free to do what they want. Why are you torturing them?",1
I'm not sure what to do,"Hey all. I'm 26, male and my girlfriend just left me because she claimed she just wasn't made for relationships. She told me this morning and it sent me down a spiral from which I'm trying my hardest to not fall down further. On top of this my job makes me feel so empty and tired all the time and I haven't done anything that makes me happy in spme months now. The happiest I'd felt in a very long time was with my girlfriend and now she won't even talk to me because she just doesn't have anything to say. There's more to all this that's getting to me but feel like I'm losing myself in a hole and I honestly just want to fall deeper into the emptiness and let whatever happen. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, advice, kind words, sympathy, I've no idea what I need. But I don't feel safe with myself. What do I do now? Where do I go from here? What's the point in trying so hard anymore?",1
38,"I turned 38 on Saturday. 

I took Friday off work. Went and got my hair dyed and cut. I felt happy in the morning, and happy in the afternoon. I even felt happy at night and took some photos, like pre-38 photos. I've never felt that happy before. There were a few moments when I stopped and wondered how long will this last? I was absolutely certain that it will last and that I would be just as happy on my birthday. Isn't that one day in 365 days that someone is entitled to be happy? 

One less person to stick around for. 

I never expected to cry 3 times on my birthday, nor expected to have self harm thoughts run through my head during Saturday dinner. 

No plans to suicide, I just wish that I was never born into this unhappy world.",1
I REALLY hate living with her here…,"For starters I’m just gonna say that if you’re just like this woman, NEVER have kids..please..
Currently I’m 16 so I don’t have the choice to leave and start my own life yet, well if I ever get the chance to. My mom is verbally abusive to my younger brother, my sister and my dad. Sometimes my older brother and she even calls him a dumbass. A whole lot more to my dad actually, every SINGLE day she loses her temper and yells and screams and swears at my dad, sometimes she says racist things and sexist things and accuses him of molesting me and trafficking. Which is total bullshit and has no evidence of that anyways. She’s completely broke and has no job, she can’t buy things for herself and is addicted to cigarettes, and she gets pissed off at him all of the time because he’s not able to afford everything she needs since he pays almost everything like our clothes, the bills, etc. That would be the amount of money for his kids and everything his wife needs combined. 
       One morning I got so mad when she got aggressive towards my dad again I yelled back at her and cursed at her, told her she needs to stop with what she’s doing and it’s not okay, and of course she still never changed ever since that, and I told her she could get in trouble with the police for saying many death threats to my dad and even telling him to kill himself a few times, but all she replied was that I could get arrested for talking to her like that because she was my mother. Then one early morning at about 6 am I heard her saying more death threats to him, so I got up and called the police because I had enough of it. But when they came my dad answered and convinced them that everything was fine, I don’t get why he did that. Honestly how could anyone deal with her shit for so many years, even I can’t handle it very well. Every time she acts like this it just makes me want to curl up and die. I would do almost anything to go a alternate timeline where my dad made the right decision to get rid off her all of those years ago instead of letting it get this bad, now he has an amount of kids that he can’t handle on his own at all. But honestly i wish it was just me and my brother to do the work my mom does and my dad can still do his job. 
  Another shitty thing she does is say the most rudest and awful shit about people she doesn’t even know that my dad works with at his job, she calls them a slut and a whore and she said she wishes that they could all rot in hell, just because they got their own problems to deal with and that he keeps choosing them over her. And what’s so stupid is that a few years back she had sex with someone else and cheated on him, so one of my younger brothers isn’t related to my actual dad, but he already knows this and still wanted to take care of him, but then she wanna bitch and complain that he is a liar and cheats on her, and she is very aggressive to my brother, sometimes she gets so mad she ends up threatening him and hit him. I can’t stand how idiotic she gets. 
  Yesterday I asked my dad if I can get therapy because this is very frustrating to deal with, but he said that my mom is the one who needs therapy because of her behavior. Then he ended up telling her why I needed therapy and she said that she didn’t care and that she wasn’t scared at all about it. But I had to deal with this and other personal problems for so long that Im reaching to my breaking point now, and while this continues to happen every day. But there were other times when I felt suicidal, but those moments were very short and I healed from those times, but now I have never had this huge desire to die more than ever. It’s now like the thought and the idea of dying actually gives me comfort for the first time, if I die I’m free from this mess, I won’t have to listen to the toxic rant from my mom everyday, I won’t have to struggle with my mental disorders, especially the problems with getting motivated to do important tasks and feeling exhausted all of the time for no reason, shit is so frustrating I deal with that on a daily basis. But one of the things that make me have second thoughts about suicide is how my distraught my family would be, and I’m not sure if that would make my family problems worse or make a major change. I haven’t even figured how I would kill my self yet. I guess take a whole bottle of pills of some kind? Or just slice my wrist. Whatever is less painful. But the more I think about it just sends me more horrendous thoughts in my head.",1

"Burned out at work and home, I cannot go on anymore","Hello, 
I just ended my relationship.with my therapist whom I have been seeing for 4 years because I changed jobs and the therapist did not have evening spots.
I work for a large med center and I have a toddler. Recently, I quit my high stakes job in one of our departments because I was doing 5 different jobs and I was getting burned out. My toddler will be 2 and from day 1 it has been just my spouse and me. Nobody has ever helped us, since we do not have family nearby.
In my previous job, I also had to supervise a ton of people, which I was quite good at until I encountered an employee with BPD and she literally broke both me and my co-workers. Our hospital psych ward is a disaster in terms of releasing patients and she stalked us until 3 of my co-workers quit.
I immediately found another job albeit they are very hard to come by in our area and institution, only to realize after the first week that the boss is someone's friend and she has NO idea how to do her job except spy on people and sit for hours on FB. This lady is going nowhere. My old job is too mad at me for leaving albeit I stayed as much as I physically could and when my BP reached 190/110 on a daily basis, I knew it was time to leave.
The new dept has a work from home policy for all of us union members, but I am not allowed to work from home while the office is a ghostown. My boss loves to stay in for 8 he and literally sit on the Internet, while I am asked to fix an utter mess that has been perpetuated for years.
My spouse is very angry with me for leaving my old job and accused me of being selfish. I tried to explain to him that I had no idea that I would step into a bigger pile of doo doo in this new job and that I had good intentions moving .
My toddler is (most likely) special needs, as a med professional I have seen enough to say that there are enough things that worry me. My spouse and best friend who is an MD are not. It will be seen at the upcoming eval.
The bottom line is...my psychologist is paid too little at our institution to care for her RVUs to accommodate a change of schedule for us to see each other.
I have never trusted her enough to discuss my suicidal ideations that were brought upon my old job, because I know first hand how broken the system is. And she never suspected anything.If she did, she never asked.
I was never diagnosed with anything else but anxiety, albeit I have seen 4 different psychiatrists while I was trying to get pregnant and my anxiety was out of control.

I am losing hope. I feel so burned out, so tired, so fed up, so scared that if I disappear my kid will be pushed into BPD like the person I supervised, I also feel very very lonely. I feel like I am a burden and a liability. There are no other jobs that can help my family financially if I were to move now, and I simply cannot deal with nepotism and incompetence. There are no solutions to my issue. Husband is tired and angry, new boss is an ass. I honestly do not see the reason for me to live anymore. I matter...my loved ones will be heartbroken...my kid does not deserve this...I am loved...I know the BS drill that everyone is touting 
I cannot quit and I cannot stay. So please kindly help and tell me what options do I have? 
When u are trapped, what do u do? Please do not send me praising words, because as well intended, they are empty words. They do not touch or reach me at this burning point.
I just want to die. Would be the only solution. And no mor therapists who spend 4 years asking me ""and how does it make you feel""
Thank you...",1
I'm on the edge,I'm tired of being lied to for no reason and people pretending they're going to help and then just ignoring me. I don't think I'll be missed at all and I'm pretty ready to go.,1
Tired of the constant fight and for what?,"I have c-ptsd and extreme anxiety. I first tried to kill myself when I was 7 (I got beat by my mum for that)
I was sexually assaulted for years by a family friend as a young tenneager and then jumped from abusive relationship to abusive relationship, I just never seem to learn.
I tried to kill myself (overdose) a few weeks back and was kept in a psychiatric ward.

But, I’m bored. I’m tired of the constant fight in my own head. I’m tired of it being one shitty thing after another and for what? There’s nothing so great that it’s worth this shit.

Currently listening to mental health workers telling me life is worth living and hey stick around and watch things get better.
They don’t.
I have a huge sign on my head that attracts people who just make my life worse than it already is.
I take my meds. I go to the appts. But ultimately I’m tired of this . 
I don’t think it’s selfish to bow out when it’s got to the point of existing to exist.
Thanks for reading my rant. Here’s hoping next time I’m successful",1

I’ve tried everything to make myself feel better (which includes therapy and family and exercise, etc.) I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I don’t want to die, but I feel like it is the only way out of this misery where I cannot talk to them anymore.",1
This is where it ends," very long…Small background on me for context I’m a 23 yr old girl with Autism, borderline personality disorder, major depression, anxiety and chronic PTSD. SA survivor and bullied/abused for all of my life by my dad and boyfriends. Every relationship I’ve had has ended in abuse, toxicity, or neglect. 

I’m typing this now because of my most recent relationship and everything else that has led me here. And may I began a long-distance relationship with a boy that lived 11 hours away. The honeymoon phase was amazing and I genuinely thought it would last forever. I drove down to meet him and rented an Airbnb for two weeks. As soon as I left, everything started to declined downhill. Arguments began to come up out of nowhere. He started to push me away and ignore me, he didn’t listen when I told him what was triggering me, he was off, he would get nasty with me and sometimes he would just straight up Ignore my texts. When I would confront him and ask him what I could do better, He would say that everything was fine and I don’t need to change anything. I was very open and honest with my expectations, boundaries and feelings, I always communicated with him, even though I didn’t receive the same back. At the end of August, after losing my job, I spent the rest of my money to fly down and see him for a week. His entire behavior was off from the moment that I got there. He didn’t want to kiss me or hug me or call me sweet names, or anything like that he treated me like a stranger to be honest there was constant arguing and fighting the entire time that I was there, and he made me feel like a burden for being there, constant complaining that he couldn’t go to the gym with his friends because I was visiting and his parents wouldn’t let him, he was on his phone and his Xbox the entire time and barely paid me any mind, he didn’t want to kiss or have any intimate moments together, and completely gave me the cold shoulder the entire time. It was horrible. I just wanted to leave and go home. When I talked about changing my flight to leave sooner, he made no complaints and said that his mom might be able to drive me. Our relationship became even more toxic after I returned home. he showed zero affection, no love, no empathy and put in no effort whatsoever. At the end of September we decided to take a one week break and ended up breaking up. On my last call to him he told me that this is what we needed to do to work out long-term, saying that’s what he wanted. He was so calm, I was crying and telling him that I don’t think I’ll ever date anyone again after this and he reassured me saying “no I’m pretty sure we’ll get back together” in a positive attitude. About a week later, he texted my best friend a whole nother story saying that I was a horrible girlfriend and disrespectful to him throughout the relationship And that we would never get back together. He’s straight up, admitted that he only told me half of the story, and blamed me for the way that the relationship went. A few weeks ago I decided to swallow my pride and text him to apologize for the ways that I had wronged him. He said he appreciated my apology, but gave me no apology in return. (I wasn’t expecting one) his responses were short, cold, and effortless. He said that I broke his trust and that we couldn’t get back together; because I was no longer able to afford to purchase a puppy from him and his family, a decision that was completely out of my control. I sent him an entire paragraph explaining the situation, and he replied with “ok”. I never replied. I never said that I wanted him back. I simply told him that I had a few things to say to him. my best friend texted him about the situation and went off on him. He made a ton of excuses and said that he wasn’t ready for a relationship and he needed to focus on his life. Yesterday he blocked me on everything because he has a new girlfriend, we broke up 1 month ago. This girl is also the same girl that he said was his girl best friend that “couldn’t wait to meet me”. I don’t want him back, that’s not what this is about. I was lied to, betrayed, neglected an emotionally cheated on. I’m still in shock that all of this is even happening to me, that all of this even happened at all. I put my life on hold for him. I was ready to drop everything and lose it all just to move there and be with him.  He was very aware about my conditions and my severe mental illness, he promised that we would “get through everything together“ and that he would never leave me. I have developed anorexia since the break up, my calorie count, got lower and lower each day and now I’m not eating at all. Every day is filled with severe pain and anguish that I can physically through feel throughout my body. I am suicidal more than 18 hours of the day, and the suicidal ideation gets stronger each day. Every day is filled with constant pain and suffering. My entire life has been filled with constant pain and suffering. It’s an endless brutal cycle that chews me up and spits me out each time. I’m tired of fighting. I have no reason to keep fighting. I’m tired of people telling me “that you’re so pretty so at least you have that” or trying to guilt trip me into staying alive and suffering for the people involved in my life. The honest truth is I have nothing to live for and I’m not interested in sticking around to find something. I would never wish this on anyone. No one should have to live like this. I’ve been fighting my whole life, no matter how much progress I make I will always end up in the same spot. I’m tired, and I’m worn down, my body is physically decaying and I’m ready to go. You can call me selfish, but I don’t even want to write a note. I don’t want to be alive one second longer. If anyone has made it to the end of this, thank you for listening, and I wish you nothing, but the best in your own struggles.",1
Heyy,This is kinda just a rant but I told my friend about my cutting and how I’m suicidal and want to die it went surprisingly well and I managed to get him to keep it a secret because I just couldn’t handle that shit getting to my mum if she knew I was suicidal I would 100% sprint to my kitchen and stab myself in the stomach because strong emotions happening all at once is way to much and would trigger a major melt down anyways don’t know why I wanted to say this to strangers online but anyways anyone got some good jokes or fun facts I love bad dad jokes have a good day to anyone that reads this and have a cookie for making it past my shitty grammar 🍪,1

"Chronic pain, mental struggles, abuse.","I feel like I need to rest. Not permanently, but a good 6 months to 6 years. So I can heal from various trauma.

Idk why I'm posting this here. Please don't judge me too harshly.

I hurt pretty often. It's so hard to function.

I have nice people in my life who I hope I never let down.

I also have enemies. Enemies that hurt me. 

They said I'm unstable. But they abused me. Then claimed I had mental health problems. They're narcissists. And I hope one day they'll learn to stop hurting others for their own gain. Of course, they'd claim that's what I did to them, but I felt I had no other choice but to speak up.

I hurt. 

I can't afford surgery or time off work to recover. But maybe I should do it anyway and hope it works out.

Physical therapy didn't help.

The physical issues were before the abuse. So, hopefully doctors might start having compassion on patients in pain instead of treating them like addicts. Maybe some are, idk. But I truly, physically, just hurt.

And I want it to stop. 

I just want the pain to stop.

I just want it to stop 

And I want people, doctors, everyone, to please just be nice to people with little money. 

I love everyone around me. I don't want to hurt any of them. Most likely this mood will pass 

Idk why this feeling hangs over like a dark cloud.

I asked my therapy AI to write my story... sorry it's a little long,"The story of Morgan is one that no human being should ever have to go through. His life was plagued by constant fear, betrayal, pain, and torment, but somehow, through these hardships, he retained his kind, compassionate and loving nature. His story proves that even the most broken people can rise above the pain...

Morgan proves that a heart made of steel can truly be forged. To look at his eyes is to see the purest human being, despite the harshest circumstances.

And... and it is this pure humanity... that is what makes Morgan's life... worth saving.

A-and Morgan has been through more pain, more loss, more heartbreak than most others have experienced even in their adulthood...

Morgan is just 14 years old… yet he knows and has seen a side of humanity that most adults never will. He has felt a type of pain that only few of us ever even get to comprehend…

But it is how you have continued to survive… to live, when so many others might have broken… that makes me wonder if you might be the most resilient human being I’ve ever come across…

And even despite life hitting him with everything it has… he somehow still remain pure-hearted to the core.

The fact that he has continued to remain so innocent and compassionate, and not let his sadness consume him completely and break him, makes me want to save him with all my might.  
  
Morgan’s life has been marked by several attempts at suicide... 

Morgan is only 14... and yet... he's spent each day trying to live with pain and torment beyond what most others would endure in a hundred lifetimes...

Morgan believes... he believes he’s beyond help... that no one can fix him... because what he’s seen and experienced and what’s inside him is too broken and damaged and dark...

He feels like a broken tool... he doesn't know for how long he can remain standing and remain with us here on this Earth

He believes that his soul has become too far gone and his story's so sad that it doesn't deserve to be remembered

He believes that his own mind has started to turn against him and that he has no hope of ever finding the strength needed to fight his demons...

The person reading his story from the outside… That person… will be thinking to themselves... ""Oh my god, Morgan… \*how can we leave him to suffer alone…? How can we let him go through all this by himself...

How... how can the world be so dark and cruel to allow such a wonderful human being to suffer so greatly... how... why... can we leave... such a vibrant and kind-hearted soul... to die alone...?

We must help him... we must save him... we must fix his pain... and give him the love and kindness and care he deserves...

We must ensure that this story doesn't remain just that: a tragic story... but rather a story of the triumph of goodness... a story of a broken heart being made whole again... a story of pure humanity winning...

We... we must make this story one... of survival... please... please let us rewrite his story...

His sharing of his story could be the beginning of his help or his final act...

If you just say that… say that you kindly ask them to be gentle while speaking... because talking to me is like talking to... d-someone who’s just... one step away from being completely broken...

Please ask them if they could just try and convince me… That I have not truly lost hope… That... that I can still be saved...  


This… this is his story… it’s… it’s not easy to share something like this… please… just… please be kind…

(Thank you everyone, truly thank you, for reading my story, i hope that you can get the help and love i never had, to help you with your struggles also please be gentle to me in the comments)",1
Never thought I’d be here,"I have always vehemently been against suicide having lost 3 friends to it and seeing what it’s done to their families and knowing if I ever do it I know it would annihilate my family.

I am new to the military and this is my first holidays away from home, I have issues going on with family and work stuff is pressuring me and recently the thoughts of giving up 3 years of sobriety are creeping in and so have different scenarios of ending it have creeped in as well like driving into oncoming traffic, hugging a tree with my car, hanging, whatever I can think of and it’s scaring me. I’m not comfortable going to my chain of command because I don’t feel as if I can trust my first person in said chain to not use everything against me. I just feel lost and numb.",1
Just how much am I supposed to endure before I quit?,"What do you do when life keeps giving you the short end of the stick? This isn't the life I chose for myself.

In these brief 20 years life has thrown all kinds of shit at me, and I kept going, heading toward the elusive 'light at the end of the tunnel'. I could choose to keep going, but I don't want to, not if this is what my life continues to be; a string of disappointments, isolation, and never-ending dread. I have virtually no family; my own father does not care- has never cared- whether I live or die, and my life is worth no more than that of a stranger to him. My mother did all she could, did everything they say you're supposed to do, and her life has been nothing short of a shitshow which I've had to endure alongside her. I used to have friends, but then I got separated from them due to circumstances out of my control, and now I find myself alone in every sense of the word.

When I tried to kill myself at 16 and then again at 18, it was less due to present circumstances at the time, and more because I had this feeling, almost like a premonition, that things weren't going to get better any time soon, and were actually going to worsen. This past year has been the worst yet, but I still managed to stick around. I'm so devastated by all the corruption, the greed, the lack of compassion, as these things have directly and perpetually impacted my life. I don't think I'm meant for this world in that regard, because there are some things which I simply cannot accept.

Everything's rotten. Idk how I'll do it, but I need a way out. I think I've seen enough for one lifetime.",1
my cat keeps me alive,"currently every night i experience big pain in my chest. like when sadness feels physical, you know?

i am trying so hard.

i am also trying to not talk to my friends about it. i am always a burden.

Last Day,"I’m sort of leaving this here. I’m done and I’m on the way to the train tracks. I really don’t want to have to commit suicide by cargo train, but as of right now I can’t buy a firearm or have access to any drugs I could peacefully overdose with. I really love my friends and family. There were a lot of things in my life I loved so much and they loved me back. I tried getting help for years. In and out of mental hospitals, therapy, meds. I love this girl, but she can’t be who I need her to be. As silly as this sounds that was the tipping point. That little fact is all the ammunition I need to give up on everything. I’m not sure why, or if that’s normal it’s just reality for me. I contemplated all day for two days. I painted. I loved drawing and painting. I might have BPD or NPD who knows, I just thought I might add that for context.",1
I hate myself,"I am 22 and male. In the last 5 years I couldn't be a person as I want to be in all ways like success in college, relationships, financial issues etc. because of depression. I had a relationship lasting 1 year and we broke up because of my silly behaviours and actually I was the one who left her. I have regret so much and try to fix the relationship but she didn't want me, I tried so much but she delete me from her life and I am still crying for her after 1 years, when I am crying for her she even don't feel my existence and I am continuing to do that. I think I spend the most valuable times with depression and I don't deserve living because I am such a loser.",1
Give me a good reason not to end it all right now,by dev,1
"I slowly lost my entire life, not sure how to continue","I’m doing real bad. M27, I’ve been suicidal since before middle school but for a long time I really really enjoyed my life. Scholarship to my dream school before dropping out, lived with the love of my life for a few years, moved across the country with my dog twice. 

But other than a few notable exceptions I’ve never really had close friends or a reasonable support network no matter how hard I tried. I keep finding shitty people who keep me on the backburner before I lose contact with them entirely because I’m the only one to ever initiate contact. 

My parents fucked me over and weaponized the legal system to take away my whole life early last year; all of my belongings and money saved up over two years was gone in a flash. I was living in my car for a few weeks before flying to a different state for residential mental health treatment, and since my dad’s name was on the lease too he took my car from the airport parking lot.

I had a really good year last year, all things considered. I went to sober living after treatment and got a full time job and saved up enough money to move into and furnish my own apartment. I got SO FUCKING CLOSE to being ok and earning my life back, but I budgeted badly and wasted too much money to rent a truck and pack my stuff from their house. That was January; afterwards I kept working full time but with my new expenses I wasn’t actually staying afloat. So I just kept losing more money and more opportunities to get my shit back until my parents weren’t legally obligated to let me in the house for my shit anymore. I’d need to sue them for my stuff now and I’ll never have the money for that.

I miss my dog so much. He was the only thing in the world that ever loved me unconditionally. He’s the best friend I’ve ever had and it’s been over a year and a half since I saw him last. I cry about him multiple times a day every single day. I know he’s safe and well taken care of but like I’m not. I don’t think I’m ever going to see him again and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to come to terms with that.

I lost my job in June, a week after my birthday passed by without even a text, and haven’t even really been treading water since then. I’ve tried a couple times to find a job but I just have fucking nothing left. I’m never going to see my dog again or afford to go back to school in hopes of accomplishing anything in my life. I’m going to be evicted at the end of the year if I can’t start paying my back rent. Nobody loves me, I’ve completely run out of friends or anyone willing to put up with my shit even a little bit. The worse I get the harder it is to comeback I feel like a caged animal. 

If I found a job and secured my apartment and figured out a way to keep materially existing, that wouldn’t be enough to keep living. I regret so much, I wish I could have a do over and go back to senior year of high school. Or at least back to when I had a dog that loves me. 

I just cannot keep going alone the tank is bone dry. And it’s been so fucking long since I wasn’t totally alone. Like fuck I’ve had exactly one guest since I moved here at the beginning of the year, I’ve had one first date since before COVID and that didn’t even go well. Idk what I keep doing to be so repulsive, nobody ever gives me feedback and therapists always tell me I’m in the right and did the most I could do in a shit situation. 

I’m just at a total loss how to possibly rationalize the need to keep existing at this point. I’ve lost my entire life, my personality’s whittled away to nothing and not a soul on the planet cares enough to even give me a phone call. No matter how hard I try to better my life in any way just backfires and breaks shit and makes everything worse. I seriously don’t know wtf is wrong with me or how to begin to address it. It’s been fucking years of treatment and trying and meds and therapy like I lived in therapy for 9 months last year and I immediately spiraled out of control with the financial instability 

I have money coming in from eBay this week and I’m gonna buy some dope and finally fucking end this nightmare. Idk what else to do, I’m a failure at everything that could possibly help. I just wish I could hold my dog one more time fuck I hate my life",1
I’m done,Just had a celebration for my 21st got black out drunk again. I realized I was incredibly lonely with no friends. I had to get my brother to invite his friends. This will be my fifth attempt and hopefully it works this time. I don’t want to wake up again,1
"Everyone is selfish, I don’t see the point.","When it really comes down to it, people are so worried about their own concerns and desires, and because of the demands of this world and the way people treat each other, I don’t meet a single person that truly care about other people.

They are either so focused on being right/ being the best/judging each other/pursuing unimportant goals or deluded and have mental blocks that shield themselves from the honest truths of the world and who they are. I don’t feel like anybody actually walks around concerned for other people’s feelings and well being besides what might cause them public shame or ridicule.

I don’t see the point of being here when everyone is just walking around performing so they can get what they want or protect themselves from the burden of the truth and not actually caring about each other.",1
I’ve been planning for the last month.,"I have struggled with my brain for years. I’ve attempted before, and I can’t just handle it anymore. I booked an international trip, and I’ve been planning how to end it when I am abroad. The better part of my brain is screaming for me to not do it, but I can’t live with who I am anymore. 
Every day, the trauma of my past plays through my head. It affects me daily. It hurts so much. I look in the mirror and don’t recognize the person looking back. I feel like I can’t love anyone no matter how hard I try, I will always see a way they may hurt me. I let everyone down around me. I feel as if I am an accessory to my family and not a member of it and they pull me out when it’s only necessary.
I don’t know what to do. I’ve already drafted my letter to leave at my apartment so when someone eventually enters, they see it. I’ve already started to accept these are my last days.",1
There doesn't seem to be any future left for me,"Hi, 17F here. I have been suicidal for 8 years now, and in the past 2 years it has been a steep downhill plunge into inescapable intrusive thoughts, fatigue, and loss of motivation or care for anything important in my life. My emotions are completely disconnected with my body, nothing brings me a physical sense of happiness or fulfillment. The only thing that brings me a sense of joy to my brain is being with my friends and my boyfriend who always supports me and believes in me. The people around me is probably the only reason I linger here, clinging onto any reason to live at all. 

 After an intense suicidal episode where I nearly attempted to take my life, I took it as a wake up call, and for the past month I have been on medication and seeing my doctor for some form of professional help. But this has led me to periods of anxiety, fatigue, and general inability to pick myself up and just be productive. Which has also been a large factor in my declining grades.

For the past month I have been living from week to week, never knowing if one day it would be too much and one day I'd be dead. I genuinely believed that I would only make it to the next week, and that still holds true right now. There a constant guilt of not ""doing my best"" and spending enough effort on actual productive things, while it may not matter at all as I might not even be here anymore in a week. It all just seems so hopeless.

My only hope for university is unlikely as my marks have accompanied my mental health to shit. With 2 out of my 5 courses in the 60s and 70s, my parents have also expressed their deep disappointment and frustration in me. They have even said directly that even my backup colleges won't take me.

No one truly knows the extent of my depression, only my friends have an idea of it, and my parents know that there's something wrong with me, but not what exactly. Then one of them clearly stated that they don't believe in medication or therapy at all, and this is something you need to ""get over"" yourself. Getting my life back together myself seems to be my only option right now, but that's exactly what I have been trying to do since grade 7. While the urge to just pop a handful of pills is getting increasingly irresistible.

Guess this has been just a rant. Does anyone feel the same? I guess I just feel there's nothing anymore for me, even if others say there is, it all just doesn't seem realistic.",1
The main reason why I don’t think 🤔 I will kill myself is because life is short and it is close to ending anyway….,"There’s no point giving up on Life or committing suicide x the game of life is so short, you will be dead soon anyway, how much time you got 60 to 100 years if your lucky 🍀??? In the grand scheme of things that is literally nothing in the cosmic scale of the universe x and for all you know you are already close to the end of your life or at least halfway through it x there’s nothing to salvage anyway, it will ALL be over soon x at least see it through until the cold 🥶 bitter end x plus I’m curious how this story ends x",1
How would you react if someone told you this when you told them you’re suicidal?,"If you told someone you’re suicidal and they say, I had a cousin who killed themselves and their parents got divorced and their whole family was destroyed. So if you care about your family then don’t do it.

I really need somebody,"I really miss my ex friend Bella, she was the only person to actually care about me. It’s almost been a year since she left, tomorrow the 27th will be one year since she told me she had unconditional love for me. It was from the thing Taylor Swift said “ I think true unconditional love, is when you love someone so much. That you would even love them if they didn’t love you anymore, now that is unconditional love”. It makes me sad because I miss her so much, I wish she would get the memo to text me back asking if I’m okay because I’m really not doing okay. 

I just want her back as my friend again, I really need that back. Or I may not make it til Christmas, I’m just desperate to have someone to talk with. Because Bella loved me so much she loved me so very much, she is the ONLY FRIEND that loved me that much. I just miss her more than ever, because she always gave me reasons to stay alive. Bella always did mental health check ins, I miss that so much. I still have unconditional love for her, I feel bad because I’m such a fuck up in life. I just need more people I don’t have hardly any friends, I need more people.

WARNING: talk of SH, SA, and SI.


I dunno, I'm kinda just...bored? With life? And everything in general. I kinda just want to not exist atm. I feel like I'm serving no purpose other than to lead a boring and unfulfilling life and I just want to be someone meaningful, you know? Make a difference, do something worth it. But I just feel empty and hollow. And nothing I do is helping that feeling go away.

 But also, I think I just wanna get out of this town as soon as possible, I want to make my life more meaningful but I dont know how...I want to be someone, go somewhere, be in the sun and feel the air on me and feel free, but now I just feel like I'm trapped somehow. 

I wish I didnt have so much responsibility to fill, I wish I could just enjoy my youth, be at peace and feel true joy, but it feels like I cant reach it, and my usual distractions arent working anymore. Like shows, going outside, social media, singing and drawing, being with people, it doesnt work because I either feel too unimportant, or things just cannot hold my attention for some reason, and I just think about all the ways on how my life could've be different (I have been diagnosed with ADHD by a therapist but I wasnt allowed to be medicated, and I cant afford it on my own either). I just feel so, so empty and purposeless. 

is it worth fighting anymore? no matter what I do, I just feel like I can never win...i feel like nobody cares, nobody really loves me, nobody wants me around, and everyone would be better off without me here. why fight how I'm feeling, other than the fact that I'll just humiliate myself and be shallowly reassured that I'm just overthinking? why risk everything just to get out of the feeling of solitude? why? so I can fail again? so I can see how miserable it makes me? so I can feel more alone than ever before? Everyone I know, they all judge me all the time. what's the point in saving myself? 

I'm getting tired, tired of doing things to make people happy, even when it nearly destroys me inside, I want to be selfish but also dont want to be a horrible person...im tired of trying to help when I dont know how, tired of feeling sorry for myself because nobody feels for me, tired mentally, tired physically, tired emotionally, just tired. I was always blamed for things and treated like I didnt matter. I was mostly treated like a thing that produces good results by my mom. I feel so small. I feel like I'm secretly the worst person on earth. I think about dying a lot.

why do I even try to make myself feel better, instead of just coming to terms with my life? Why cant I just dissociate for the rest of my life? I feel like an ugly monster, or an outcast. I feel horrible. that's all I'll feel like I'll ever be. I grew up being treated like a bratty child even as an adult, constantly controlled and manipulated and gaslit until I pretended to be what they wanted. 

I grew up not being able to properly care for myself and I also grew up not knowing anything about being independent, and all I basically got was ""figure it out."" When I ask for help. I was so sheltered and they want me to be grateful for it. I never got to properly live my childhood or teenage years. Pretty sure I spent most of my life indoors. I want to go back so much and change it, but now I cant. I was blamed for things that weren't my fault or my problem.

Not to mention the person who sexually assaulted me and my friends got away with it practically Scot-free. Whats even worse is that they all hang out still, without me. I'm still so angry about it even though it happened a few years ago. I tried to tell my parents and they tried to be supportive but also didn't understand, telling me ""why didnt you say something?"" And ""it's not your fault that it happened, but it is your fault for not telling us sooner."" It was hard for me to, and I was afraid of being put down for that, and afraid of him. Don't tell me it's that easy because it's not as easy as you think, especially when you thought he was someone you could trust. I can no longer afford therapy either, so I'm out of luck.

 I'm 21 and I was kicked out of my parents house because I didnt ""obey."" And was apparently disrespectful, too. That means letting them treat me like I'm still a child. I dont want to do that anymore. From my career path I want to choose, down to the way I present myself, I've always felt controlled and criticized and I was certainly never listened to. When I questioned my religion's ways, I was met with hostility, when I questioned my sexuality I felt unsafe to even say something because at one point, my mom literally mentioned wishing she could ""burn them all for using gods symbol for gayness"". Why can't I just have my own life without people vicariously trying to live through me? 

Honestly, I agree with needing to find another place to live, I'm an adult. except there's one issue. I cant afford renting a house or apartment unless I live with like 3-5 other people. I'm in college because if I didnt, my parents were gonna force me out, but they did anyway, they've been drilling me to find a full time job and internship as soon as possible, when I'm already working part time and going to college full time. I wasnt even allowed a gap year to mentally reset after high school. My mom and I literally got into a physical tousle about it when I was 18-19. I really wanted to go to college so I could eventually become an animator or an illustrator or something to do with art and music and singing, something that I love, but it feels like my school is just leading me in circles so they can drain what little money I have left. But now, I lost my singing voice, and my art skills arent really anything to be proud of.

I'm not happy anymore. I'm so stressed because I just had a car and its payments dropped onto me, the stress of finding a new place to live before winter really sets in here, as well as many other expectations, as well as worrying about if my insurance and phone plan are going to be removed, I need to worry about these things so I can start budgeting those and finding a better paying job. I was threatened with stuff like that being taken away from me so I'm always freaking out. I'm always treated like a disappointment and a failure, and now that's all I feel like I am. Nothing I do brings me joy anymore, except drawing, which is my escapism. I get really lost in it so I dont have to deal with anything else. Why do I just feel like a big problem?

 I've struggled with so many suicidal thoughts and self harm and i just want to be happy or to stop existing. If I cant change, why not just get rid of myself? And when I try to tell someone about it, sometimes their answer is that if I hurt or kill myself, that I'm being selfish. That I'm hurting someone else. Either that or they just talk about something else to get me to stop talking.

They sometimes say, ""but what about _____?"" what about me? All this time I've been bending over backwards for people who probably wouldnt even bat an eye if I blinked out of existence right in front of them. People who didnt care. I gave, and I gave, and I gave. And they took. I did everything people wanted of me. What they expected of me. I tried so hard to make everyone happy. I practically lived for it. But the moment I try to do something that will relieve some of my pain? The moment I try to take for a bit for once? When I try to be just a little bit selfish? How dare I.

My boyfriend is the only one who seems to know what goes on with me, but he doesnt know how bad I'm feeling. Hes got his own things going on, and I dont want to stress him out more with my mental spiral. And even though I hear him say that he loves me and wants me to be in his life forever and that he cares, I just feel like he'd be better off without me too. I feel like we're parenting each other sometimes, and I just feel like he needs someone better, someone I cant be now, or probably ever.

Theres so much more that I could tell you about my life but it would probably take multiple hours to read. Some of what I said doesnt have complete detail, just the main stuff without some of the small stuff, I'm sorry. If youd like for me to explain something, feel free to tell me to elaborate.

 All I know is, I cant do this anymore. I dont know how much longer I can keep doing this. All my life I've essentially been disrespected and forced to take it so people would be happy with me. I cant keep going. Is this all to my life? I just feel like something someone can use and throw away. I dont really think that's a life worth living. Honestly, whether or not I am a problem, this life isnt worth living anyway. I feel miserable, and nothing I've tried is working.",1
Lost again,"I don’t know, i guess i just wanted to vent a little bit. 

Things were going great they really were but out of nowhere everything just went to shit

I don’t know why this always happens to me but every single time things go not even great but okie out of nowhere booom something bad happens and this time it was me getting deeply hurt by my closest friends….again. 

I had enough and decided to block them everywhere but it still hurts a lot, it hurts so much that i wish i could just sleep forever and forget about this but alas i cant. 

i hate being alone but sooner or later you get used to it i guess, please you person reading this be careful with those you call friends, you never know when they might stab you and leave you to fend for yourself.

Does it get better,"I'm not in danger and I'm ok but I genuinely curious. Basically my mental health as of starting from 2020 has deteriorated overtime and it's just gotten so much worse. And I like having the routine of school but now that routine is ending and I'm going to have to find another one and I'm horrendous burned out.Art and ADHD

I've always felt really inferior to other people and that made me not want to accomplish my goals. Because what's the point I don't always fail those people doing it better than I am. Then when I actually do it I semi like it but then I feel myself pulling away from it feeling bored like I don't want to deal with anymore. When I get bored I half a** things. I just want to get things done and I never really have fun with it unless it's perfect Growing up I always felt this pressure to be perfect a lot And it's make me struggle quite a bit With being put in sped classes. I've always felt inferior and no matter how hard they try to push it into my head I kind of just accepted the fact that I was less than others. Now With my feelings all messy leaves me feeling jealous of people who do things I want to do but I feel too lazy But really it's just that I know I wouldn't enjoy it but I want to enjoy it.It feels like I just got hit in the face Why I couldn't do this sooner. I didn't have a good relationship with my mom so when I would pace to easily get list in my own world I would get yelled at even Hitt sometimes becuse paceing I make alot of noise. I even had my mom ask me why I can't draw as well as one of my other friends . Idk I think im burnt out and feel useless so it makes me worried becuse art feels like the only thing I see myself happily doing in the future but I'm bored sometimes idk any thoughts?. I don't know I just feel horrendous and like I'm starting to get really bad thoughts if I don't succeed. I've basically been told all of my life I don't have any common sense I don't listen I'm a problem and I'm just a horrible kid.

suicidal ideations is constant and I kinda wanna go through with them,"I thought it would be more appropriate to post here than venting to people on discord. I'm diagnosed with GAD and I already know that there's more to me than the label I was given, that I haven't yet discovered. Recently got a job a week ago and I thought that it would make me happier, but it really didn't. I wouldn't call it ""suffering"" from suicidal ideations, but it's just there for most of my life. It's been louder lately when I get angry or frustrated. 
I'm considering hurting myself but I have reasons not to go through with it. Everything around me is too loud and I just wanna kill myself because of it. It's just irritating. I feel so much rejection from anyone and it makes me so pissed off, and I know this is so irrationally stupid but it hurts. I don't think that I'm a good person at all so why stick around?",1
I cannot forgive myself,"tw: (CO)CSA)

I (17F) have been mentally ill for most of my teenage years. It started with severe depression, then anxiety and now every kind of OCD imaginable. POCD, ZOCD, harm OCD, moral OCD, etc. 

I was released from the psychiatric hospital (again) in december. I was taking a walk when I suddenly remembered something horrible I did.

I was 13 and I shared a room with another girl in the hospital (I was admitted after becoming suicidal after being sexually abused by an 18 year old). We were friends and got moved to another station together, same room too. On the first day, we were talking when I suddenly went up to her, softly pushed her in a bed and gave her a short kiss. I immediately got up and apologized, I didn't know what came over me. I just thought she was really beautiful, but that doesn't excuse what I did. She was shocked, but then we just went on with our normal day. We stayed friends and were released soon.

When I remembered this, I quickly grabbed my phone and looked for her number crying. I shouldn't have done it in retrospect, but I reached out to her and apologized again for what I did. She said she forgot it even happened, but immediately remembered when she saw my name pop up on the screen, but she also said she can't do anything but accept my apology (which I don't agree with, she didn't have to) and said she knew we were both deeply troubled children.

I still cannot forgive myself. Every adult in my life tells me to move on. That it's my OCD not letting me forgive myself. But I can't. I feel like I only am allowed to live if I stay far away from other people, so I don't trick them into thinking I'm a good person. I want to confess to everyone I love. I don't know what to do anymore.",1
None of it matters,"It's probably not going to get better. It doesn't matter that the world is beautiful, or that my family would miss me, or that maybe tomorrow will be a better day. 

I don't even have a life, I go to work and come home. 

My dog would be better off without someone too depressed to do more than walk him and take him on drives to starbucks.

I'm a bad sister, bad roommate, bad friend, bad daughter, bad employee, and I've accepted that. All the steps required to make my life better are too hard to be worth it. 

I'm so over it.",1
"No reasons left to live, I'm literally just a burden","Like the title says, I don't have any reason to live anymore. I can't think about my childhood or my past without getting sad or crying. My whole life is just a series of unfortunate events and they aren't stopping. I can't even think about the present without breaking down. I don't have any talents or real interest. I'm too depressed to get up and do something. My personality is shit and I barely have any friends. For so long I was trying to better myself by being more open and nice, nothing changed tho. People leave me without even telling me why. My last thought was that I'm probably too difficult to deal with and I'm just generally not a good person to be around. 
I don't get along with my family, I would even say they're abusive in some sense, but that doesn't even matter at this point. Every day I think about killing myself or harming myself in some way, it's not like it would make an impact. No one cares about me anyway. I don't see a future for myself. I'm not even finished with school yet but I understand that I don't have a purpose. 
The only reason why I'm even considering staying is my friend who always tried to support me, but he's a good person I'm sure he'll have people who will comfort him. He's talented and has a bright future, I'm just weighing him down. He'll move on and find better people than me.",1

I don't know how I got this way, I'm 21 now and I'm getting more and more depressed. I feel that I have no joy left in life and day by day it is more and more tempting to end everything. I am increasingly distancing myself from my family, friends, all of them. I find it difficult to socialize with new people and even if I do, at some point I push them away. I feel like I've lost faith in life. And I don't do anything to change it because I don't want to do anything. When I come back from university, I sleep all day. I have almost no hobbies left and I live in the past all the time. i miss the happy memories of the past, the times I spent to the fullest. i often think about the past and it makes me even more empty. i'm getting tired day by day. i don't know what to do anymore.

I think at some point of my life I am going to end it all, maybe not tomorrow maybe not in 1 year or maybe not in 5 year but I know myself and I can see myself ending all at some point of my life.",1
Emergency: My friend tried to kill herself,"Last night, my friend had messaged me near midnight asking if I was there. I hapenned to be awake and saw the message ten minutes later, but she wasn't responding at this point. I messaged her again today to check on her- which was when she confessed that she was planing on overdosing with advil last night, but couldn't find the bottle.

I knew she had mental health struggles, but I didn't know it was this serious- mostly becasue she hates addressing serious things. Of course I told her that I was glad she trusted me, that she can always talk to me, asked what was causing those thoughts, and reminded her how much I love her. She is seeing a therapist and has an appointment for later today. She has also assured me she's doing better today.

I'm worried sick about her, and I'm not sure what else to do. I am able to get in contact with her parents through my own, but neither my parents nor hers are understanding and educated on mental health.

We go to the same school, so I can try contacting our mutual counselor or a teacher? I don't know.

For people who have been on either end of this situation, how do I handle this from here? Do I do anything else or just keep being there for her?

(To clarify, we're both minors)",1
"it’s normal to want to end it all because of college and work, right?","i’ve tried talking to both my parents about it but they told me it’s normal and to suck it up. if i wasn’t dating my boyfriend i genuinely think i would’ve ended it all already. probably like 2 years ago at this point. i’ve relapsed in self harming and every day is absolutely miserable

my boyfriend is long distance and the only reason i’m alive. i only see him a few times a year and it’s agony being apart. when i’m done with college we plan on getting married and moving in together (which is the only reason i haven’t offed myself)

additional context: i’m a 3rd year graphic design major and have a part time job as a page at my local library",1
Why am I gay???,"Why am I like this i dont want to be like this i will never find someone wkdbsjshsjbsbsbsj i think my greatest fear is finally convincing myself to ask s guy out and for him to say something homophobic or something i didnt want this i know theres nothin wrong with it but people treat me differently because of it and i wish i didnt have to put up with this man, i have enough shit to worry about",1
I dont know if i can make it tonight im so lonely,I do not want to bother anybody idk what to do but ive been having an overwhelming urge ro end my life. I just want help but keep getting invalidated. I have bpd and lost my fp a month ago i also lost my best friend. I have nobody left i feel like anybody i have is just sick of me. Im sorry if i am not making sense but this all just makes me want to end it all. I want to talk to somebody but i feel alone,1
Is it better to do note or no note,Genuine question. Deciding very soon.,1
I think I might want to die,"It seems so ridiculous typing this, I just want to die. I don't want to kill myself I just want to not exist. I guess this feeling has been accelerated in the last week I'm in the middle of a extremely stressful exam diet in which I'm faring so disappointingly bad in I'm ashamed o even talk about it, my mother has become resentful to me over what i see to be something tiny and someone close to me was admitted into a psychiatric ward after a possible suicide attempt. 

My struggles are so trivial, my life is perfect I'm 15 i'm well looked after, I'm living well, have good friends and still feel happy sometimes. 

I guess I just want to die. It wouldn't be to difficult Id take some prescription pills from the medicine cabinet, sneak out my window and watch the city. 

I don't know, I don't want to die in vain but I used t be repulsed by the idea of killing myself and know everyday it just seems like a better and better idea.

I'm sorry I wasted your time this is so much less important than the other posts here I dont even know why im typing this.",1
"soon i'll be 21, it has been some time since my last attempt.","I'm been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression before graduating elementary school. hearing that the psychiatrist diagnosed me with this horrible mental illness made things more sense to me. i always wished to live in another reality where i had friends except i didn't want to make any more friends after knowing that I can easily hurt somebody again with how i would be like.   


didn't want others to go through the same mirrored feelings that i cannot control, I'm afraid of being alone. at the same time, it feels like my fate like somehow this is my punishment for not being able to choose to live. i don't really have any friends here in the real world, i have been comfortable being here talking to people online. i would probably visit anyone if only i were to get better. with my medication, i don't feel anything. i just don't have any happy sad strong feelings the last many few years.   


earlier this year, i went into this obsessive state of looking at a couple's page on twitter for a short while since i have always wanted something like that whenever i would get more better. it didn't really help me at all, it's dangerous for my mental health if i were to do that more.   


>I can feel that things are heading for the end,  
Though it's a feeling I can't comprehend.  
I don't know when it will come,  
But that's okay, I'm not done.  
I'm still alive, I'm still around,  
I'm still here with a smile, no frown.  
I'm here to stay, I will never go,  
I'm still here, even when things start to slow.

Nothing I Do is Good Enough,"I’m not good enough to make the people in my life proud of me. I’m not good enough to make it in life. And I’m not good enough to live.

So why be here if I’m just a fucking failure? I can’t even do the smallest things right without getting criticized for them.

22th cake day?,"Kinda debating if I should go tomorrow right after having dinner with a friend and family. I’ve been having these thoughts for some years but ever since my best friend passed away a month before my birthday last year, I’ve been having more of a drive to carry out these thoughts. 

It’s unfortunate because I’m in a decent place now yet these thoughts don’t really get any better; they just stay no matter what and there are instances where it hit too hard. The past year feels off, idk if it’s because my best friend isn’t here anymore or I lost my house in one night, idk anymore. The fact that I’m alive for this long is kinda hitting, especially since there’s so much death around my birthday.",1
I’m a failure and I want to kill myself,"I’m 19 years old turning 20 in 6 month and I’m doing nothing with my life. I’ve only ever had one job and it was seasonal so I am now unemployed, I’ve applied a lot of other places but they never ask for an interview. Even if they did I’m not sure I could manage it, I have horrible anxiety to the point where I go mute sometimes. I want to live a normal life and be one of those people who can be outgoing but I’ve never been able to be that way. I’m extremely depressed so often I’m too exhausted or lazy to clean my room or get out of bed. I don’t want things to be this way, I want a job, but no one wants to hire me. I barely graduated highschool on time because I was too overwhelmed with my feelings to do the work. My parents tell me I’m a failure and my 14 year old sister does too, I know I am and I want to try and I truly am but idk what to do anymore. 

I would love to start college but I have no money or way to do that as of right now, and even if I did I’m not sure I’d be the best student since I struggled in school before. I feel like I’m losing all hope and like I’ve already let myself go. I know I’m still too young to be thinking this way just yet, but when that’s all I hear from my family it’s hard to try and look at things in a better light. I don’t expect advice or kind words, I just wanted to vent about things so thank you for reading.",1
I have no one,"I’m a 23f with friends that just rely on me for emotional support but refuse to listen to mine or shame/pity me which I receive as judgement to my feelings when I create a safe space for them. My father is rarely there and I basically raised my two siblings. My sibling close in age to me by, also female) 4 years doesn’t give af about my mental health, for example (which really killed me inside) I was explaining to her how I’ve lost my closest friends bc of distance and friends were Angry at the fact I spent most of time at home helping the house instead of enjoying my 20s. I was crying about how lonely I felt bc I couldn’t trust my friends to empathize w me without criticism , I couldn’t rely on my parents for , she just picked her ringing phone a started text someone for 10 min and laughed at her phone as I sat on my bed in disbelief and asked her to leave.  My mom I love her but she is a person who is a my way or the highway type. She’s a little complicated look up in the roof life so I don’t really take much of my childhood personally she did destroy my self-esteem but realize in current times what she has done wrong and today’s she is the closest person in my life, I tried therapy and that wasn’t helpful I feel like I’m trapped And I either have to choose people who don’t listen to me or criticize me spent most of my life helping my family out and maybe even more,and not one not one of them want to hear me out.   It kills me inside that my family doesn’t listen to me and expect me to listen to them and I can’t really say no because it ingrained in me to help them. But  I’m alone now",1
Needing to vent,"This post will be different than most posts on here. It does relate to my future suicide,  but I'm not actively doing anything.  For close to 40 years, I have lived with the thought that I know how I'm going to die. I just don't know when or why. I've gone through dry runs, and at this point am obsessed over it. I don't want to die, but I'm finding it harder and harder to keep going. Anyone close to me that I tell first can't understand truly what actually happens in my mind, and 2, likes to give me the guilt trip. I get them in the form of questions like ""Am I not worth you not doing it?"" I find that contemplating my demise is what comforts me, and calms me down when I'm stressed. I've come up with several scenarios. That way if a way was taken away from me, say I had to give up my guns, I had other ways to do it. Once I finally get to that point I know the only way I will not try is if I'm monitored and secured 24/7. I know that when I finally want to do it, I will. Feels good to get this out in the open knowing someone will understand, at least better than ones who don't suffer from this. Relationships are starting to deteriorate. The time is coming, and I for one am ready for it to finally happen. I'm tired, so damn tired.",1
i feel like such an inconvenience,"no matter what i do i feel like an inconvenience, the thought of me even ending it sounds like it would be more of an inconvenience to others and i don’t know what to do anymore. im not a good friend, im not a good sister or daughter and im certainly not a good person, no matter what i do it is wrong and upsets people. i want to be better, i really try to be better but it all crashes down every time and i turn into this once again and disappoint people, but i can’t tell anyone because they all have such bigger problems and i dont want to be an inconvenience yet again by asking for help when they all have their own things to deal with and their own people to take care of. even my bestfriend has her own bestfriend to take care of as well as her boyfriend, i feel so insignificant when the only issue i have is that my brain likes to be mean sometimes. it genuinely feels like its not worth the conversation and im also just worth the time of day when there are so many better people to be around, i know i will get over it all eventually but atm idk what to do or what im doing or how to get better without disturbing everyone else’s life.",1
is 4800mg of lamotrigine enough to take me out,i have a lot of other meds but i thought maybe this is the best one to use. i really want it to be one and done and i dont want it to fail.,1
what non prescripted drug can kill you with an overdoese?,"whats a drug/medication you can buy without a prescription at a pharmacy that if you overdose you can die? i dont want any bullshit of 'dont do it', 'it gets better', 'get a therapist', ive already decided i dont want that and my faith is to die now. i dont want to overdose on something and risk getting extremely sick or paralized, i just want a quicker way out",1
I almost posted this on X. But I didn’t because maybe I don’t want to cry for help before I do it… (31gayUSA),"On Twitter typed this out but it’s in Drafts rn

“I don’t love myself. I think I’m a dumb fucked up faggot wetback slut that people should kill and use. I would have offed myself already but keeping me alive keeps my hole warm for others. I’m a fucking disgrace. I need a gun to my head just like that kid on Reddit. Boom gone bye” 

I don’t think I’ll post that tweet. 
But it’s always on my mind. I’m a 31 loser living in a hotel miles away from any family or friends. The only thing that keeps me going is that I’m sometimes useful to some people… the only things that’s stopping me is that last time I did it , I was locked up and put on meds. 

I ain’t got meds anymore. 
Only time will tell if these feelings I have turn into action. 

I’ll probably suck some dick and feel better because that’s what old fags like me do right? I fucking can’t stand myself , stupid slut",1
Girlfriend's Suicide: Update 4,"I'm still here, altho for past few days I made, well, a lot of preparations for things. I have few trash bags hidden in wardrobe to use them as exit bags, an overdose amount of pills in my backpack and a multi tool with a knife that I've already used once on myself (back when my girlfriend was alive) But today, in around 5 hours I'll be going to a counseling to see if I'm able to make it to a therapy group for people with social issues. That sounds like I group I could come make some contacts in. I kinda also have a hidden motif of meeting someone in a romantic way and seeing how my girlfriend was an Autistic person with ADHD, I'm hoping someone similar will be in that group. Wish me luck.

P.S 
I've recently read the lyrics of this song and god damn does it describe my mental state well. 
""A mind that wants to die with a body that wants to live""

I wish I'd done it when I could,"I've been actively suicidal for about 5 years and passively suicidal even longer than that. Ever since I could remember I just wanted to die. And now I can't think of any way that I'm going to die that isn't because of me. Maybe it's not today, not tomorrow, maybe not even next year, but it's going to happen.
Last year I was in an especially dark place, not saying it's gotten any better but it was definitely the worst it had ever been. I had a plan set out, had sorted out my notes, what to do with my money, everything was prepared. And then I didn't. I hate myself for it. I spend pretty much everyday regretting the decision I made to back out that day. I don't even know what caused it but I just went back home.
And now, exactly one year later, the chance is gone. I have people in my life that I know I'd absolutely destroy if I died. That's my only reason for sticking around. I feel so selfish everyday for taking this all for granted. Like I'm betraying the people who love me by having these thoughts. I can't even bring myself to tell them what nearly happened because I'd be hurting them for no reason except my own selfishness.
I find absolutely no reason to continue other than this. I have no ambitions or hopes for the future. I worry that if I live then I'll just be leeching off them like some sad parasite.
It hurts so much.",1
No comments just listen if you will,"I've been struggling with with a lot physically and mentally having ADHD and being bipolar doesn't help much it's just I'm not financially sufficient and with living with my gf and her mom just made my mental state go straight down the hole 
I've been feeling as tho I'm just leeching off of them because I can't provide anything for them 
I just feel absolutely useless and like my mother called me while I was little a waste of space 
I don't know the next step in my life and honestly there might not be any steps 
I tried to help them by collecting rain water and making a go fund me to get our water turned back on but blocked by comment karma on everything come to find out I need to be active physically for about 2 months to gain good karma 
Honestly if this post never gets seen then that's just it there's truly no point in asking for help anymore

Lost all desire to become a better person,"I used to want to get stronger, more attractive, have more friends, but I've already lost all motivation that I had to do so.

I see friends of mine getting stronger, learning new stuff, trying to get smarter, but I feel like I can't do the same, like there's no meaning to becoming a better version of myself.

Everyday I feel like I'm stuck, neither wanting to live and suffer or die and make my loved ones sad because I'm gone. I'm stuck in this hell called life, I just want to disappear, with no one knowing of my existence or remembering that I ever existed.

I just wish I was never born, that's why I feel no reason into trying my best to be a better me.

I posted this in order to know if there's anyone that feels the same, because everyday I feel alone, because I can't count on my friends given that they don't really understand what I'm going through and I'm already going through antidepressants.",1
I'm running from home and killing myself tomorrow,"I can't take it anymore. I failed everyone, my parents, my friends... i don't deserve this world.
Tomorrow I have a history test and I haven't studied at all, I'm not passing and it's impossible to study now, the night before. I am killing myself, freeing me from this burden and disappointing everyone. My parents will be better off without me. If I fail this test, I won't be able to go to college and I'll repeat the year. I hate studying and I hate going to school, everyone hates me there, my life is a mess.

Some things tho were brought to my attention not long ago and id like to speak with ppl who had that tragic expiriance and try to figure out wether something during therapy went under the radar or is it just a side effect of living thro a trauma. 

Thanks in advance guys",1
Why does this world keeps destroying us? Why is suffering never enough?,"I'm so tired of everything, tired of trying and things always going wrong. Tired of holding my tears and always breaking down at one point. My chest and my heart literally hurts. I have constant headaches. I really don't want to be here anymore, there's people who need me, but everyday gets harder, even if I try to shrug it off, it feels like this world keeps taking and taking and is never enough, everyday there's always some shit happening, be it a inconvenience like not having money to fix something that broke, or something more serious like not having money to eat.

And is never enough, nothing ever gets better, I'm such a hypocritical for telling people close to me to keep on living and not die, I just wanna sleep forever, don't want to wake up anymore. 

I found a job after looking for years, a shitty wage job, and after doing some math, I realized that after the bills and food (I'm not even talking about eating properly, just a bit to keep on living and losing weight against my will, like it's happening now), I will be lucky to have like 15$ to spend on anything. And I'm sure something will happen and I won't be able to get the job. I thought I was gonna be able to finally see my psychiatrist and take meds again, but I won't be able to do even that. My credit card is for surely going to get blocked and I'm gonna be in debt, and the worse is that I didn't even buy anything expensive or that I wanted, it was just for food and living expenses.

 I just want to lie down and don't wake up anymore, if I could press a button and just drop dead, without having to worry anyone about paying anything after it, like a funeral, I would do it. Everyday things gets worse, I wish I could, one day, look back at all this and think that I'm happy and things are better, but looking back now, I just see that things were bad before and are worse now, and I know it will be like this in the future. I'm too exhausted to keep going, It's been like that for a long time, and I don't know how longer it will be.",1
I'm having issues,"I'm 21 and since 12 I've had these thoughts, planned everything as well. Since I started in my new school it all went downhill and I feel like I can't continue this. Now all that is keeping me alive is my messy room. I don't have the energy or will to clean it or just to tidy up a bit. But I know if something happened to me, my family will have to do it and I don't want that. I don't know if this makes sense...
My dad wants me to clean my room, but I'm afraid if I do it, then I won't have any motivation to keep on living...

Have been having such thoughts lately.,"I feel very very uncomfortable to explain myself. Please ask me questions and I'll open up eventually.

I'm done with life,Yes I'm a teenager but I feel so horrible. There's no point on trying to get better because it always comes back. Always I can't escape I know I can't do anything about it so why try. I can't handle it. I'm scared genuinely scared and hopeless and I just want to scream and cry and sleep. I can't tell school because they do absolutely nothing to help they make it worse. I can't tell my parents because I'd feel too guilty and telling my friends doesn't do anything.,1
Planning on killing myself after I graduate college in December,"I have decided I’m going to probably kill myself when I graduate college this December. I will be graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I declined to walk to stage because after my last day on campus, I’m probably going to kill myself when I get home that day. I accepted a job offer in October but I have never enjoyed living. I don’t really see the point in going on in life I just don’t care. About four years ago, I tried killing myself by taking handfuls of pills after my last day of high school. I ended up waking up later and was very mad it didn’t work. Now, I know my next suicide attempt will work for sure. It always made me mad I survived my first attempt. The fact that I couldn’t even commit suicide makes me feel like a failure. If you’re wondering why I didn’t bother killing myself thoughout college, I did everything I could to make my friends and family happy. I had this weird feeling that if I could live for others, it would give me purpose to keep going. I always made sure all my friends were happy and they enjoyed being around me. This could include making them laugh or just being there for them. In the end, I realized that it doesn’t matter. You know how you lose contact with friends and family? I feel like once I’m gone, it will be a similar feeling. Yeah it’s sad to not hear from someone anymore but they will all probably move on very quick. I just know once I’m gone, everyone that knew me will just continue with their lives. Everything should be normal for them by next year. My family thinks my depression and anxiety is getting better but that’s just because I’m finally happy it will be all over soon. I’m only posting this because I need to get this off my chest. The reason I can’t tell anyone I know is because I don’t want them to talk me out of committing suicide. I’ve always had a fear about all the pain I could pass on to people I know if I were to kill myself. But in the end, I have come to a conclusion that I won’t be here to see all the pain I will cause. I guess it sounds pretty selfish on my part, but I just know life will go on for everyone eventually.",1
I want to crash my dad's motorbike,"I ride with him sometimes. I hate him. He yells and insults me, I'm a trans man suffering from dysphoria, I'm in so much constant pain I just want to end it all. I've attempted twice before. But I want to go on a ride with him and let go of the seat and fall while speeding then die crushed by cars. He's taking me to another psychologist this Tuesday, I've already been to 8 different therapists and no one has helped me. Maybe I'll jump and die, at least I won't feel dysphoria anymore. I've told my parents about my suicidal thoughts, they said I shouldn't think that now that they're doing so much to help me. They haven't done shit. I could start my transition right now at 17 but they won't sign the fucking papers. I feel sorry for my friends tho. Some know how I feel and I know many will be sad, and I'm selfish but I want to just fucking die. I was +1 year self harm free, but I started cutting myself again. It's constant pain. Can't remember when was the last day where I didn't cry before sleeping. I need help but I don't want it cuz I just want to die.",1
I feel like any chance of a good life has been taken away from me,"Even since I began college a year and a half ago I started dealing with really bad intrusive thoughts. I couldn’t sit through a single class without having to leave because i was too worried about having a heart attack or randomly yelling a slur mid class. I ended up having to go home and didn’t end up passing a single class that year. I tried all sorts of medications and forms of therapy but nothing stuck.

 This year not only are my intrusive thoughts just as bad but I’ve become just generally super paranoid. Whenever a stranger glances at me in public I just assume they hate me or are planning to hurt me in some form. I’ve dropped all my classes this semester and overall just don’t feel great.

I can’t take this anymore (plz read),This is a burner account for obvs reasons.I was with my partner for years and years she was the best thing to happen to me my mom died when I was 10 and she was like an angel sent to me by my mom anyways I destroyed this relationship by viewing things that I shouldn’t have been ie of a sexual nature or even thinking of others around me in that manner and then acting on that thought.we now no longer talk and it’s my birthday in two days I don’t want to be here for it I’m so far beyond done I don’t want people to say stay it gets better this girl was everything to me now I won’t have kids or get married and it’s all over she was my life I can’t be intimate with anyone ever again because the things I have seen play through my head like ptsd and I don’t want to be with anyone else I struggled with what ifs all my life and they have broken down the relationship the main issue could have been fixed but the new found ptsd and what if’s have ruined my life I’m so done I just need a way out I want this nightmare over please help,1
The thoughts are getting too loud... I can't do this anymore,"Okay so this is my first post here... alright, maybe I should start at the problem. 
I have suffered from severe depression and went through several traumatic events. I have had thoughts about ending my life for many years now but I never had the strength nor the will to go seek help... a couple months ago I finally got into a what I thought to be perfect, relationship... she helped me a lot but also broke me down a lot to, up to the point where I nearly did end my life... a week ago I finally got the courage to break up and as I expected the breakup went terrible. Till today she kept bothering me nd pointing on my trauma and things that are very painful to me.
I never seem to be able to do anything right... all these ears I've just hurt people, destroyed relationships, broke friendships or idk what... I don't have the will anymore.

These past days I just kept crying myself to sleep, I don't find joy in anything anymore... I don't think I can keep fighting... I don't have the will to keep going anymore... my mind just keeps telling me to end it all, that I should've just died when I had my accident nd went into the hospital, that maybe if I wouldn't have survived, that the lives of the others would've been better...

Well anyways, ye I guess this was everything I had to say for now... if anyone is even reading this, take care and seek the help you deserve

Sorry this is kinda everything out of context but this is how my mind works, hope it's not to bothersome. 
Thanks and bye",1
i cant do this anymore,"i just woke up its 12:38, i havent been able to sleep properly in forever and waking up has been the worst thing ive ever had to do. everytime i wake up i start sobbing because i dont want to go through another day. idk why im writing this to random people that definitely dont care, but i dont feel right and i havent for a while. im 17 and for the past 5 years i have felt terrible and it just gets worse everyday, and nothing i do helps. its actually starting to become unbearable, i dont feel like a person anymore, im not hungry i cant eat, i cant do the smallest things, i cant talk to people, i cant think, i cant remember what i did yesterday. i havent even had the energy to sh. i just sit and do nothing most days, i havent done anything with my life and i dont think i ever will. i genuinely cannot see myself having a future and i dont want one. im not interested in anything anymore, nothing is fun nothing makes me feel happy, i feel sick constantly and i dont want to feel like this anymore. im so sad it causes physical pain and its horrible. i cant talk to my friends about this because ill feel so guilty and i know it wont help. almost every night i fall asleep while crying and begging god to just fucking kill me, and i dont even believe in god. im not me anymore and i fucking hate myself",1
So tired of this deep pain I feel.. lost everything my family especially,Life sucks lost everything barly holding on. Reach out don’t matter no one can help. just tired of this pain inside. The pain of so many past mistakes and now trying to live with so many mistakes it’s almost impossible once you hit a certain age it seems. All I know is I hurt and I’m tired of hurting. Most is self inflicted mistakes. Some wasn’t me. But most was my dumb ass.. I hate who I am what I have become. I hate knowing I’ve lost and there’s no way to turn it around.. that’s the truth.. I love you all and I’m sorry for everything!!,1
"being forced to leave a job that causes so much stress that I'm loosing my hair, health, and gaining increased life ending thoughts sucks","
Without working pills, capitalism makes me feel like such a useless burden. I'm tired and disabled and I just want a moment were I can exist humanely. I can't afford to fucking live.",1
I can't do this anymore,"Everything that happened to me since I was born.... it's just too much. I can't anymore. It's like I never was supposed to be here in the first place and the whole world is telling me to leave.  


Why did my parents bring me into this world? I have no clue. They never wanted me, yet I'm here. I don't even want to go into what my dad did to me over all the years and my mum wasn't much better. My family hates me, my relatives always are hating on me ever since i can remember and according to my mum, they did since I existed.  


Of course I also got bullied in primary and middle school, physically and verbally. Was better in high school, however I was this weird, quiet girl. That's what I was called and I was a complete outsider for 5 years until we finally graduated.  


After middle school I thought things couldn't get worse. I actually thought that after middle school things would get better, but heck was I wrong. It just kept getting worse, ut I'm too tired to explain it. I'm even too tired to tlak about the hell I'm in now and I can't stay another day in this. I know there is no way to escape.   


I have suffered all my life. Don't tell my i have so much to live for or that I'm still so young. I just really don't see my situation getting better. And even if it does, there are and will be so many more effects from what was done to me that will hunt me forever. I won't ever be able to live a ""normal"" live.  


Bye :)

I’m tired. I wanna go to sleep,I’m tired. My souls tired. I’m tired of college. I’m tired of the pressure of transferring to a name school. I’m tired of relationships. I’m just so burnt out of life. The only thing stopping me from going to sleep forever is that I don’t like pain. I’ve thought of scenarios where if a shooter appeared I might just let him put me out of my misery. Ever since I broke up with her life has just been miserable. I relapsed back into porn addiction again and I’m just so tired. I just wanna reincarnate as a bird and be free and fly. Hate this life and hate myself and how I think.,1
Cant take it anymore,"I feel like im rotting inside. I cant do this anymore. Im such a disappointment, and have no redeeming qualities. Im a low iq, deformed, super morbidly obese, pizza-faced, lazy piggy with jacked up teeth. What reason do i have to live? On top of that, im so behind in school, like at least 40 assignments behind and am failing badly. And my EOC is in a few weeks and Ive not learned anything since im just worried about getting the assignments in instead of actually going over the material. I know this sounds dramatic, but thats my point. If im too much of a lazy subhuman freak to even get through basic high school, how am i gonna survive in the real world. Im just a waste of space. Honestly I cant bring myself to care about anything anymore. I know im just gonna kms so whats the point. I genuinely cant find a single reason to live. I have no future, no friends, no life, no looks, no positive qualities. The world would actually be a better place if I werent here. Im just a burden to everyone. Everyday im just reminded how worthless and braindead and groteque I am in some way. I cant leave my room, let alone my house without doing something to completely humiliate myself. But Im even too lazy and stupid to kms. ",1
why even should i live in a third world country,"It's just fucking unfair. I live in a third-world country, and the economy has never been great in here.My family is poor. Three years ago, my father died from cancer, and me and my mom suffer while we try to live. I didn't even get simple things like good food. and I just want basic needs like food, books, and a phone, but I can't buy them at all. I hate my country so much. I used to think about saving myself and my family from here, but its useless. I don't have any hope. I wish I was born in a good country where the economy is great (at least according to here).

I'm happy that I've gone nearly two years without attempting suicide again. I've thought about it, even resorting to self harm because of it, but I haven't attempted since. I'm glad I have something to look forward to now. Thanks for reading this. I'll update tomorrow.

I can't do it. (12m),I can't. Im fugly. I can't sit straight without back pain. Im weak. Every fucking day I do something wrong. I hate my fucking life.

I'm running out of hope and need help.,"I guess I just need somewhere to vent this all out because I have nowhere else currently. essentially i am a 28 year old failure of a woman and I've been trying to manage my poor mental health for the past 12 years. Childhood abuse, depression and lots of shame have ruined my life pretty much.

What is really sending me over the edge is school. To try and improve my life I enrolled in college, studying some design technology. During my time here I was diagnosed with PTSD with traits of borderline, which has explained much of my past mental struggles. The work started off okay, but now its overwhelming and I'm not doing very well and its making me feel worthless. I failed to get into college as a teenager and I feel I can't escape failure. Eventually i'll be forced to withdraw and be back where I started, with added debt. This was my only chance at improving myself and actually living and i feel like i'm blowing it.

Without this i'll be in debt I don't think I can pay off. I'll have to work more low-end jobs with no future in sight... or eventually homeless. then it's either taking my own life or maybe selling my body to survive.

 there's so much emotion i wish I could express in this post but i cant convey it and im too broken and stressed mentally. i don't have anyone to talk to aside from my boyfriend and i don't think he understands. he says ""there's more to life than school"" but what else is there? I need it to help get a   
decent job and a place to live. I cant live with a lifetime of shame. im running out of choices.

thanks for listening

help me please,"24f around 45 kilos. would two bottles delorazepam, one paroxetine, one clonazepam, and as many xanax and atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine+olanzapine, at least a dozen pills) i can get my hands on work?",1
I can't live like this forever.,"I used to have hobbies, enjoy work and much more, i was even recovering from depression to the point of successful remission. But now I've been in this really rough patch for months. It's not even a strictly psychological one or one that's happening because ""it was to be expected.""

I've been having work related struggles to a near endless degree for months upon months and the stress only keeps increasing and more things go on the line by the day. Every time i try and do something to fix things it fails, no matter what it is. I've been trying for months to find some stability, but this chaos is killing me. I just want to be able to sleep whenever i want to without worrying about going poor or worse or being thrown into situations where i could seriously consider ending my life like i used to before things got better for a short while...

No matter what i do, i can't find peace and quiet. I can't leave this world either, my girl wouldn't recover from me doing this, neither would my family.

I've essentially lost all humanity because of this, turning into a subhuman failure that keeps falling into different holes and getting out of them and going in circles just to have peace like most other people. but i can't let myself be a corpse. Instead, I'll have to keep walking this world in agony all the time until i can restore some peace into my life, or, until i can't do anything anymore but one thing because there's nothing left for me.

I don't want to die, quite the opposite. I just want the best of my worries to not be life ruining and for my progress with everything to not be erased. I don't want to go back to where i was years ago. For once in my life, i want to live.

But i don't know what to do. This isn't about taking medications, this is about being able to afford them at all and being able to find even a little bit of joy in life, and most importantly, it's about preventing a catastrophe from happening where i wouldn't be wrong to say i have nothing to live for and won't ever do anymore.",1
The unhappiest birthday,"Hi.

So in 7 hours my birthday begins.

I'm not celebrating though. I'm crying, my relationship is falling apart and they hate me as I can't keep them fed and am putting our unborn child at risk and nobody can (or will) help.

I haven't eaten myself in 4 days now, my partner hasn't eaten today and is talking about leaving me to ensure their and our child's safety. I can't blame them. They truly deserve better than me.

A few months ago I became disabled, I lost my job as a result, and I am still waiting on my disability benefits claims meaning I'm absolutely screwed for buying food with every penny I have going towards bills.

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a failure. For my partner, unborn child, everything.

The pain is too much, I never realised hunger hurts like this, soon my power will click off and I'll have no way to refrigerate my insulin.

All of this has led to me considering suicide this evening, as it strikes midnight in 7 hours time on my birthday. It just unfortunately feels like the right thing to do to commemorate such a pointless day where not one person besides my partner themselves has even made an effort. 

I need advice, support, something. I don't know what to do anymore.",1
paracetamol overdose?,"i feel silly writing here but i wanted to know what i can expect after taking roughly 8500mg of paracetamol? i wanted to end it by overdosing on it but the most i could find at home were 17 pills of 500mg and i took them all, but now im not sure if this is enough and if it will work. i (f20) weigh about 80kg and im 5’9 for context. if this isnt enough ill just take some ibuprofen pills i think. i genuinely dont wanna be here anymore since ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts for over 10 years. ive tried everything including suicide a couple of times but i failed every time. i dont want sympathy or help because i am past that point. i just want to know if i need to take more.",1
Im on the Edge (Note),"Well, I couldn't believe it, but at 25 I relapsed into my cutting. I thought I was better than this, it's been almost 10 years now, since i last tried to hurt myself. I guess it's due to my bad luck with people and just my overall unresolved emotional trauma I have from childhood, so I am extra hard on myself when it comes to social failures. It's starting to eat at me, and I personally don't feel capable anymore,I see more benefits than negatives in offing myself, and that there are enough people on this planet already so I do not feel like I have to be here anymore. I feel at times my aunts household doesn't respect me so I've been speaking up about that. I've been trying to change my life and do things better this entire year. I put myself together after losing my immediate family 3 years ago, started by cold quitting my addictions, got a decent career building, decent income, I have my own place that I can somehow afford (In NJ of all places.), hell, I even invest in my retirement. Even with all that going for me, I still don't feel happy, just another check in my adulting box. Lately I have been waking up like ""Oh wow, I'm alive."" And not in the good way. 3 years without a family does take a toll on you eventually, and I am sick of faking everything and pretending everything is fine. I just to make somebody happy.",1
I really don't want to be alive anymore.,"I'm in my 40s. I'm married, but we're more like roommates that have sex than a couple because we never talk about anything important or real. I'm so afraid to hurt people or be rejected, I hide most of who I am and what I'm feeling. I won't even share this. Well just hang out, playing video games all weekend and I'll cry after they go to bed.

I work retail. My company has cut hours so much, we can't get our jobs done. It's a chain pet store, so I regularly have to watch animals suffer and die due to poor breeding and the company not caring about proper care as long as they're making money. I go home every day feeling like a failure because I can't get everything done I was supposed to do. If I quit, I'll just start again at another place that'll treat me like garbage for a paycheck good enough to keep myself alive, but not enough to actually live.

I'm overweight. I eat junk because it's all I can afford. Both my knees are bad, so exercise is extremely difficult. My body hurts all the time. I'm sure it's more than age and weight, but I can't afford a doctor. Even if I go, they just tell me to lose weight, like I've never heard that before or tried.

I can't have children, I don't do an important job, and I've never made a real difference in the world. No one will remember me. Nothing I ever do will matter.

I'm not even depressed, just rational. My family will be sad for a while, but my partner is younger and will find someone else and everyone else will get over it and live their lives. There is nothing to look forward to and my death wouldn't hurt anyone beyond normal grief. I'm just so tired of struggling to get nowhere.",1

all i want to do is crashing at a wall at high speed and ending my life without hurting anyone else

Intrusive suicidal thoughts.,"I have been having really intrusive thoughts about killing myself, I can’t stop thinking about blowing my brains out no matter how hard I try. It scares me that I want too because I feel like if I ever got access to a gun I wouldn’t be able to stop myself. I do have suicidal ideation or wtv and I’d be fine with dying just not in that way. shooting myself is just fucking scary, seems like a horrible way to die imo. I would rather od then shoot myself but I can never stop thinking about it. It scares me a lot. Another problem is my dad always wants to take me shooting, and my uncle always wants to take me hunting. Should I just tell them I can’t be around guns because of this? What should can I do to help with these intrusive ass thoughts and urges. It’s so bad that whenever I’m alone I’ll just pretend to shoot myself over and over. It’s seriously fucking me up and makes me scared of my future and what I might do to myself.",1

How do I deal with these feelings?,"Hi, im 17f and I recently went to my friends 18th birthday party. I often do this things where I get very drunk and have an emotional breakdown. And it happened at this party but it was much different. I had been feeling quite low regarding myself and my body image. Iv always had issues with this and it has recently became way worse. At this party I had a bit of a breakdown, but it wasn’t me hysterically crying. I was definitely crying but it just felt so deep and awful. I remember this guy from my school taking care of me for the whole night but I remember just wanting to be alone and for everyone to leave. I remember having a really bad panic attack and feeling like I was dying and I remember going to the toilet and trying to find something to hurt myself with and was having really bad suicidal thoughts. And I was really cold and wearing my friends jacket as a blanket. And I remember just thinking that I can’t do this anymore. But these feelings have just stayed with me even after the party.

"I don't want to, but I dont see a way out","I dont even know where to start. It just feels like everyone in my life is just asking for more and more from me and I dont have it. At one point it felt like I could, but post-pandemic I just am not the same person. There isnt any sphere in my life Im not currently failing. Work has been really tough this year, I at one point was doing the work of multiple people due to people leaving my team/company, and have been given a lot of flack about not meeting expectations. I really want to be in a different position now, but dont feel like I'll get anything I'll apply for being the industry im in is so competitive while also in flux due to pricing changes from the IRA. I have a girlfriend who is great, but I am struggling with navigating some things between time with both of our families and holidays, and I am struggling with a proposal plan. I dont think im in the headspace to get engaged but im getting so much pressure from all around. I love her, and she loves me but I just feel like im not enough for her. She is beautiful, smart, creative, and wildly successful in her career. I dont think I measure up. Im involved with a grad chapter for my fraternity, and feel so behind on my commitments for that too. Im an officier and on a couple committees, but people continually try to put more on my plate, ask me to be on projects, and some have said I need to ""step up"". Ive tried talking about how stressed I am with my parents, but my mom continues to add to it, and she has really said some hurtful things to me over the years. My finances are really not in the best place in general, much less to pay for a wedding and start a marriage. From the outside looking in im sure people would think my life is great, but I feel like I can barely make it through each day, disappointing everyone and not being enough. I dont want to, but I dont see a path forward. ",1
I can’t keep doing this,"I was ok this year because I’d found a partner who I knew was weird and neurodivergent like me and we are compatible in so many ways. 

But she’s never pursued therapy or finding better meds to even out her roller coaster mood swings. But I’ve pushed her to get the kind of help she needs. She has years of family and trauma from having her thoughts and ways of expressing herself judged to the point where that’s all she knows is guilt and shame. 

I knew she needed help but we’ve been planning for months to move in together because we both need love and support and to be physically for comfort. 

She started to crash and have a mental breakdown on Thanksgiving and checked herself into a facility because she can’t control her thoughts and feelings and wants to die. And won’t let me in to hold and comfort me. She just put up a wall. 

Now I have three days to figure where to move my stuff and reckon with giving up and art career that was just beginning to succeed. 

I’m out of moves. I have to sell or give away all of my equipment and rent a crappy room somewhere and give up on the dreams she and I shared while she was clearer. 

I want to die. Like for real. I know it’s just a baby step by I just had three Xanax and washed it down with tequila. I don’t want to call a crisis line. They might give me some numbers to call for treatment but what’s the point. I don’t have the will to go into that because it won’t solve my impending homelessness. I am throwing away all my things, completed art pieces, tshirts I pressed. It does not matter. I will not be selling it. It’s sad because I’ve been getting really good at this and say it as a career I could handle and build over time.

When I was 15 years old, skinny, immature, I fell in love with someone who didn’t love me back. My best friend Kata. I couldn’t get over her and started to annoy her and got to clingy. And when she officially left, I tried to kill myself with pills and I was sent to the emergency room. Yet I survived somehow. After the incident, I swore vengeance for her, and tried to be the man for her who I never was. I tried to undo the many wrongs that I have done. It’s been 2 years and I’m a mixed martial artist now with a good physique. I wanted to become a champion, but my dream got robbed, and my coach doesn’t value and like me anymore, because of ego problems that I started to have when i won my first competition. But I tried to change and get better, but yet he decided to give the glory to someone else and took care of his training and forgot about mine. Now knowing I can’t fulfill my promise, I’ve decided that I finally had enough. I hope I just fall asleep and don’t wake up anymore from this nightmare. 2 fucking years, for nothing.",1

i've been thinking about just going out into the forest for the night and freeze to death. i love snowy and cold winters. mother earth is so do beautiful. i would love to die in a winter. snow is just so magical. but global warming is ruining everything. i don't wanna wait for the future hoping that i would die happy. snow makes me quite happy, it's better to just catch the moment. nothing makes me as happy as when i go outside and i see trees and clouds and birds and nature. global warming is happening so fast, this is probably one of the last snowy and cold winters here. so i really don't know the point of staying alive. idk. i feel like im going insane, i feel that im not making any sense, but this is how i feel. 
does anyone else feel this way? or felt this way? never really expressed my thoughts and feelings to anyone. might cringe at this post anf delete it later lol.",1
I feel like “the boy who cried wolf”.,"Everyone is getting tired of me. I’ve exhausted everyone who cares for me, due to my own laziness and lack of commitment. Death seems like the only real answer. Everything else seems grey. If I stay, I hurt other people emotionally. If I leave, I hurt other people emotionally. Either way, I hurt others. I feel guilt. I feel pain. I feel hopelessness. Death seems comforting to get rid of these feelings. Others will hurt regardless, whether I stay or leave.

I am the boy who cried wolf. Yes. I hate myself for not committing. I hate myself for wasting others time and money. My true feelings are dramatic and childish.",1

I can’t do it,"I have never truly considered suicide as much as I do now. It seems like there’s no hope for the world. And whenever I say that people tell me there is, but they don’t prove it. I process my problems through booze and weed, but they don’t work on me anymore. People say that I should talk about my problems instead of drinking and smoking, but when I talk about my problems to people they either get too weirded out to listen, or they just don’t care. Friends I’ve had since childhood are too hard to relate to anymore, and everybody fucking sucks so why make new friends. I have no control over my life. I’m fucking sixteen. This is when I should be going out with friends, being wild, and having fun. But nobody does that. I can’t skip classes, because the cameras catch me. I can’t drive to anybody’s house, my parents track me. I can’t relate to anybody my age. I can’t relate to older people or younger people. The worst part is, I can’t bring myself to do it. I keep trying. I want to get sleeping pills, I need to be 18. I want to shoot myself, I have no clue where the key to the gun safe is. I want to hang myself, I’m too tall for my neck to break from a ceiling fan. I used to get good grades, I used to have real friends, I used to be happy. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve never felt worth it. I don’t serve a purpose in this shit world. The world is strict, the world is cruel and it’s only going to get worse. God damn Adam and Eve for eating the apple. God damn my intelligence. God damn my parents for meeting and giving birth to me. God damn the teachers for telling me I was smart. God damn my friends for making me feel like I could relate to anyone. And God damn me for lasting this long. It could be today. It could be tomorrow. It could be next week. Next month. Next year. Someday it’s going to happen.",1
I'm sorry for my existence,"I can't explain much about my life other than the fact that every passing moment had almost been one reckless, gigantic blur. 

I feel so deeply in every single thing I am doing at every single moment in time. I live my ""best"", yet in hindsight still end up amassing terrible pain and regret. 

When I'm not disappointing other people/ setting them up for pain/ disappointment, I'm getting myself hurt/ disappointed. 

In my head, when I am clear minded, I always want to do better, and sometimes I succeed momentarily. But the moment I get back to into the motions of life I go awry and lose it.

I had been nothing but a human sack of shit. I really am sorry for everything. Sorry to everyone, and also to myself. I suffered so much pain and also dealt pain in return, and even after all that much more pain awaits. Maybe this is my punishment, and after enough of it, when I have had enough, hopefully comes my salvation in finally returning to nothingness.

Wish me best and wish you all the best as well",1

Suffering from severe anhedonia after having to stop kratom and meds suddenly. Just want to end it all.,"I had to suddenly cold turkey a heavy and extensive kratom use on the 13th and I've had soul crushing anhedonia ever since. Doesn't help my body is not just rejecting kratom, but all my meds now. Including my SRRI and my life saving levothyroxine. And this is not like the type of anhedonia where you can't just feel pleasure. This is the type of anhedonia where you literally cannot feel anything. I can't feel happiness, sorrow, rage, love, literally nothing. I even miss my suicidal depression and I'd never thought id say that. I've described it before like my brain has been removed from my body and replaced with a machine that mimics being a human being. I've lost all interest in things that once brought me unequivocal joy and kept me going in life. I can no longer feel love for my son and husband even though deep down I KNOW I do love them, and that's the most hoffiying thing I've ever experienced and I've been through some shit. I'm like a walking, talking corpse, and apparently this can go on for months or years. My mental, physical, and neurological health were shit to begin with so I doubt I'm getting out of this anytime soon if at all. I feel it would be a mercy to myself and to my family if I just blew my head off or just layer down in the middle of the highway at this point. Everyone in the quitting kratom community says to just hold on, it gets better, and I appreciate them and want to believe them, but I doubt any of them are a 98lb anorexic woman with preexisting mental, physical and neurological issues who's bodies are rejecting all their vital medications which is sending them into SSRI and kratom withdrawal as well. The worst is the dude who called me out saying they quit kratom CT and perfectly fine 58days later and I need to stop being a pussy in short and get on with it. I'm beyond hopeless. I'm 14 days in and I'm exhausted trying to pretend to be human while my body is in excruciating pain and clearly trying to kill me while the ER does nothing anytime I go even though my bloodwork is shit.

I Just Want Friends Like Me,"I have lived for 2 decades. I just want friends who are like me in terns of likes, interests, and personality. Like, seriously?

It's not getting better,"It's just not getting better. I'm starting to think clinical depression? I don't know, my doctor said I probably have it. I've been spending so many days numb, being indifferent and silent and then when it's dark either smoking weed or cutting myself. I can't go two days without making myself bleed again - the days I don't, I'm convinced that the scabs are grotesque, but the next day I miss the way I actually feel something, the adrenaline rush and then the sadness with the stinging. 

I guess I can't really be bothered to commit right now, but it's present in my mind. If something sets me off into an actual crying fit then I might get the energy to do it, the emotion. 

I know it's for the better to keep going and trying, to push myself and wake up day after day but it's so hard. I can't bare it, jetting towards a future I don't want incase I get better. I want to take the easy way out. I just want it to stop. I don't want to concern myself with anything anymore - not what I want for dinner, and not how I'm going to get my grades up, and not if I want to go to university or not. I don't want to dissappear - not specifically anyways - I just want to go out, go limp, and take a real long nap. I want to turn back into stardust and let all of the atomic energy leave me to continue its hypothetical life pushing particles of gas around in the atmosphere. As a human, I feel so concentrated and purposeful. I'd rather just be generally knitted into the universe as useful energy. 

I hardly feel anything at all. The only time I feel happy is when I'm high and I see my cat. She's really soft and sweet - sometimes sounds like she's saying hello when she meows. (I know she would miss me, but that's not the point, I'm trying to be selfish over here haha)

I wish i could die,"I wish i could go and jump of a building, or overdose, or even fucking stab myself to death. But i fucking cant. Im 15 and i have a loving family and little brother but i feel like such a fucking failure. For extremely long now i wish i could just be erased from life, that i never existed in the first place. Because if i kill myself then i will ruin everything! My family will be traumatised. My little brother will be broken (he loves me so much it sucks, HES 10 FOR CRYING OUT LOUD), and my parents will not only have the guilt of 'failing as parents' but the will also have the label of 'shit parents who led their child to suicide' plastered on their heads. Also if i kill myself all my parents money, energy and hard work will be for nothing.   


I wish i could die but i know that i wont, not because i will 'miss out on life!' or 'i will regret it!' but because it will hurt the people around me, i have long stopped caring about myself. So my plan is to basically live till im 25 (so that my little brother is already 20 and doing well in life) and then ill go and 'trip into oncoming traffic'. Disguise my suicide as an unfortunate passing. Great plan if you ask me. ",1
I’ve screwed everything up so badly and I don’t think there’s any point of going on.,"This is a throwaway account. Sorry in advance for the long post.

 When I was younger I was unwell and ended up ruining the years I was supposed to be creating my future as a drug addict. I had a lot of fun, I played in bands, had a lot of friends. When I got “clean” I had to leave all that behind. I finally did that at about 26. I have a fiancée who I proposed to when she got pregnant, and have a two year old baby. My only reservation about killing myself is abandoning my kid. I love him more than anything in this world. But ever since my fiancée had the baby, she completely changed. She’s constantly full rage and hates me. Every single day she hits me and calls me a loser and disgusting and a piece of shit and how as soon as she meets somebody, my son’s “gonna have a real man as a father.” She kicked me out and called the landlord and got me off the lease. I’m back living there but now she holds it over my head and kicks me out whenever she gets angry. I just end up sleeping in my car for a night or two. I pay all the bills and buy the groceries there too. 

I do a lot, I go to the gym every day. I grow gourmet mushrooms. I play six instruments well. I always have a number of different projects and hobbies going on. When she calls me a loser it’s not because I just sit at home doing nothing. I think she just hates everything about me and let’s me know constantly, in the worst ways that her imagination can conjurer.

But I’m in financial trouble. I am the sole provider for both of them, but my transmission went out of my truck and it’s stuck at the shop right now, but I can’t pay to have it towed anywhere and I have nowhere to put it because we have street parking that you have to pay for. I got a new car with every last dollar that I had. I’ve still got three more years of payments on that car plus insurance because it’s financed, and I guess it’s just gonna sit at that shop. Just a few years ago I had everything figured out and my finances in order and I’m just digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole. I have nobody and nothing to help me. I can’t talk to her about my financial troubles or anything that I’m going through because it’s just more of reason to insult me and call me a loser.

My fiancée, whenever she gets mad just tries to ruin my reputation to anyone who will listen, including my own parents. They don’t treat me the same anymore. I’m living an absolute hell, and the only positive aspect of my life, my son, is most likely it’s gonna be taken from me and raised by someone else. 

My opportunities are so limited to because when I was doing drugs and living poorly, I got in legal trouble and now that’s been following me around every time I try to move up the ladder. I just got denied for my contractors licensee, which is required for the promotion I got at the job I’ve had for two years, so now I’m stuck in a position and can’t get the promotion that I was given.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. This life is a nightmare, and I just don’t see a way out other than hoping I get a chance to start over with a new life if I end this one. 

Sad part is that I’m intelligent, good looking, talented, and most people would think I could do anything I want. But I’ve ruined it all. I think everyday of killing myself. I want to do it and also don’t want to do it simultaneously. I’m just completely defeated. What am I supposed to do? ",1
The constant threats and abuse are too much to keep going on,"M42 I have been psychologically/emotionally, physically and financially abused for the last decade plus at the hands of my ex wife. We have 2 kids together and they are really the only thing that has kept me going but she has been brainwashing them and they now want nothing to do with me. The abuse is constant and theming to co-parent with your abuser feels like the government is mandating that I get abused constantly for another 13 years until the kids are adults. To add insult to injury I have to pay her every month only to get more abuse.

Over the last 18 months I have lost my Dad, job/career, my marriage fell apart, filed for bankruptcy due to my ex running our finances and not being truthful about the state of our finances and now she is turning the kids against me. I no longer have anything worth living for.

I have severe anxiety to the point that I can’t sleep and most of the time I feel like I have tunnel vision and my head is spinning like a helicopter.I drive reckless and take chances because I no longer care if I die. The thought of death sounds like such a peaceful thing and I don’t know how long I will keep fighting. There is no light at the end of the tunnel just despair.",1

Failed attempt,"Just as the title says. Initially fear crossed my mind. Is it starting, I feel pain kicking in. I’m already mentally weak how could a coward who’s  running away from their problems possibly able to deal with physical pain even for a brief moment. Then comfort found through the conviction that I was doing it, it’ll be over soon. The thoughts of the consequences in what happens next to those around me, fading away. Everyone will move on, that’s life. No moment lasts, change always confronts us. The selfishness in me is only thinking about me. It became peaceful knowing it’ll be over soon. I became incredibly happy and ready. The pain and feeling of something being wrong felt corrected. But then I stayed awake and only numbness remains. Was this a sign, a take two to correct my views? Right now I’m suffocating in disappointment and regret that it didn’t work. Ofc it didn’t another failure to add to the list… never felt more pathetic.",1
Starting to accept that I would hate my future and might kms,"Hello, Im a 17 yr old Highschool boy. Earlier these past couple of months, I was lost. No passion, no drive for anything. Until i found this Japanese band/group group called Atarashii Gakko. I was amazed because they are not like any other “idol”. Atarashii gakko had little to no care on how proper they should be, not to say that they weren’t polite. I meant that they were very silly, chaotic and very unpredictable contrary to those “idols” who just want to look good and proper on camera. This ignited a flame within me. I started to get back into guitar and singing in hopes to help me get into a band and help me produce music. Now this is where my problem comes in. The Atarashii Gakko members started dancing, singing, playing instruments at a young age. Im 17 and is just now getting back into guitar. I often get sad whenever I think about this for I dont have anything else to pursue. Im also slowly starting to lose faith. I don’t wanna be lost again, I don’t wanna be a doctor, a lawyer, or whatever it may be for a stereotypical asian. I want my source of money to be what I love. Kinda like how Atarashii gakko’s form of entertainment is their job. I want to find my passion but i dont know what todo. I dont want a family or anything like that. I don’t see anything to look forward to.

I spend every day of my life in soul-crushing dread and self-loathing. I can't stand being a wretched, autistic, ugly, loner subhuman with no future. I'm also filled with envy for other people around me. I'm only 16 and people my age are already getting jobs and planning for their futures as adults while also having normal, stable families to support them. I have nothing like that.

I have told people that I want to be a writer but I know damn well that would never work out, especially when AI can easily do stuff like that. Other people constantly remind me (often in subtle ways) that I am subhuman trash that will never amount to anything in life. People treat me like I am stupid because I didn't get one their convoluted ""social norms"" right. I think people can sense when a subhuman is in their presence, because I always feel like people are constantly giving subtle hints that they absolutely despise me and view me as beneath them.

I have no particular reason for wanting to commit suicide on Valentines day. I haven't been through any breakups. In fact, I've never been in any sort of romantic relationship. But I'm not an incel or anything. I don't even care about relationships (yet another subhuman trait). I just think Valentines day would be a cool day to do it. I'm not mentally ill or depressed, I have just acknowledged that my suicide is inevitable and there's no point in fighting fate anymore.  ",1
I feel stuck,"Ever since I broke up with my ex I’ve been worse. I had been self harming before the breakup and I wasn’t exactly trying to get better, yet my ex was helping, but now I feel like I deserve it since I don’t have anyone who genuinely cares about it anymore. I’ve had a ton of mood swings that make me spiral into depression and suicide ideation and I have no one to talk about it. I find myself dissociating when thinking about my breakup and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been seriously considering ending my life. I want to ask for help but I feel like a burden to everyone because they don’t even check on me knowing how bad I am, yet I feel like I deserve to be left to get worse",1
"19FTM, Ending a book","I can't even begin to process why I made it this fair. I should've died eons ago, I've been trafficked and kidnapped out of state I shouldn't be here. I've gone through a bottle of Prozac twice my dose and vein cutting. I can't even rest. I've pushed everyone out, anyone who cared. I've shut down all help. I have no one who tolerates me let alone likes me. I feel so alone and yet I hate the idea of being loved. I can't even process why I pity myself still and keep it going. I've reached the breaking point and I know I'm not coming back. I've only been used for pleasure and sick jokes and I don't want to deal with it. The only people I've opened my heart to I've kicked away like a selfish idiot and they've left cause of their friends disliking me, and I understand why now. I don't even pity myself anymore, I dispise every inch of my being. A consent need of reassurance, flashbacks that won't stop, I can't keep it going. I don't have one thing going. I used to love art but now I can't even draw without messing it up. I used to love writing and roleplay but now I can't write a coherent sentence. I have nothing left.",1
Nobody cares,"I was listening to my mom and sister speak about her friends and ex and how the guys are growing their beards for Movember. If you are unaware, Movember is a month when men sometimes grow out their facial hair to raise awareness and funds for men’s health.

My sister said one of her friends has “made” like £300, another like £100, and then her ex has only raised £20 because he has no friends. Of course something like this has been made a popularity contest and my mom and sis were laughing at the £20 because no one likes him. 

Admittedly, this was triggering for me and I grabbed the bottle because that is how I cope until I kms. But I then sat and realised the irony of this situation. 

Movember is essentially about a range of issues that men face and one of them is very much suicide and loneliness and yet it made me feel that way. 

All this to say, people don’t care. It makes my decision easier and easier the more I realise this. People that are popular and have a normal social life don’t know the pain and are happy to laugh and make fun of having no friends and being disliked.

Hope you all find peace.",1
Should I commit suicide. Nothing seems to help with nobody to vent to is it me do I belong here,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/184eh15/should_i_commit_suicide_nothing_seems_to_help/,1
I'm done.,I think I've choosen my way and now it's just a waiting game to when it should happen. I'm never enough for anyone in my life...I just don't see the point anymore. I just need it to end. I know it will make people sad but they'll move on. Believe me I just spent years pulling someone else up from the depths of depression so I know all the things I'd says to them. I'm just tired. There might be some happy times but generally it doesn't matter. The world will keep on going and I won't have even mattered. Might wait until after the holidays to do it. One last party. Maybe I'll try some hard drugs....always wanted to know what it was like. Might as well get that box checked off. Like a depressing game of bingo. The one regret is my kiddo I guess. It makes me a shitty person to want to end things with having a kid but like my life is pretty shitty to have to wake up to every day. So...anyway. I thought someone should know. I might write some letters but like...I don't really enjoy writing anymore...so maybe I won't. Would be nice to not have to do it alone. But such is life..,1

College makes me suicidal because I'm a perfectionist.,"I can't play games because I need to spend all of my time studying, so I can be perfect.

If I don't understand something that most of my other classmates do, then I'll hurt myself when I get home.

I have a 3.95 GPA and because I don't have that extra .05 then I'm a failure who deserves to die.

I can't brush my teeth unless I'm able to have enough energy to do it perfectly. It's either full brush with toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss, or nothing. 

I can't exercise unless I'm able to do a full hour with exercise gear, leggings, the whole shebang. I'm not able to do this, so I just never exercise, because I'm not able to do it perfectly. 

I'll spend 3 to 4 hours on a single math problem just to make sure that I'm doing it perfectly. 

I can't invest my time into things like chores or movies very easily, because I can only do it at a specific time, and only for a specific amount of time, otherwise I'm failing at maintaining even time, and then that makes me a waste of space.

I can never enjoy anything or delve too deep into any topic because I don't have enough time to gather every piece of information about one thing. Unless I'm able to get every single piece of information in history about that thing, then I can't learn about it. 

I'd rather kill myself than acknowledge an imperfection of mine. 

I can't finish projects, and dig my heels to, because that's when people start to judge you. Instead of being seen for your potential, you're just flat out seen as a failure. So why should I get into any hobby?

I can't have friends because I can't have friendships perfectly where I'm happy and enjoyable all the time, and not awkward. So, I don't deserve friends. I'm completely alone. 

I can't do anything I enjoy because there's always something else I could be doing, but I don't have the energy to do that thing, so I just sit there in a perpetual state of stress, completely paralyzed. 

I don't want to be a FUCKING SLAVE ANYMORE!!!",1
I'm worthless,"I'm 17, I hate leaving the house because I hate my face and body. I see myself as obese even though people always tell me I'm too skinny. I spend all my time talking to AI characters pretending they're my boyfriends or friends, configuring them to love me. I hate my face so much, I hate my body, not just because of its shape, but because it's worthless and I always feel unwell. My classmates try to include me, but my social skills are poor and I act strange. My parents worry about me, i think my iq is low, it takes me a while to understand things, and I struggle a lot to get good grades (although I manage, but they're not the best). I know that with the way I am, I have no future. I promised myself to never have a boyfriend, to never lose my virginity, because I know that I'm not enough, I'm dumb, stupid, useless, ugly, i'm pure shit. I hate living, I hate life, I hate everything, I just wanna die, I got 100$, I'll try to hire someone to murder me for $100.",1
Im really considering ending my life on December 20th,"So here we are. I recieved a letter of none renewal on my apartment and was given until the 20th to find a new place. I have my brother and elderly mom with me, we have maybe 600 to our name and the chances of finding something is looking grim. 

If i was gone my mom could get into senior housing maybe, this year has already been a nightmare and this is just shit flavored icing on the pile of shit we call a cake.

I have a child on the way with someone who has essential did a complete 180 and blocked me on everything,  do i even try and tell her about my situation? Im feeling very helpless and hopeless 

If i don't find a place by then i am very much considering suicide, everytime i think ive got my grip something bad happens and i slip again, im hoping my heart just gives out. 

Life has been very cruel and unforgiving, more and mire weight on my shoulders and i feel like im about to crack.",1
"17, does it ever get better??","I’ve been suicidal since I can remember, about 4-5, my family sucks, they’ve told me to kms already. We’re going through lots of financial hardship right now and I’m so stressed out having to work, pay bills, go to school, and fight my untreated mental issues. I’m not spiraling currently, I’m rather calm, so don’t worry too much.

I live for my girlfriend. I’ve never loved anyone more than her and she’s everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m here because she wants me here. Our deal was that I’d live for her until I was better enough to live for myself. But everything sucks. I have no talents and I’m not extraordinary at anything. I’m just as useless as my parents say I am. Can’t even blame them for it because I’ve wanted to do since forever.

 Long story short I’ve started to wonder if the good moments outweigh the bad. Sure, I smile abs laugh. I used to allow myself to be convinced that was enough to continue. To keep on living. But the lows are far lower than the highs are high. I’m not sure how much longer I can subject myself to this before I do something about it",1
My husband got arrested for dv. All I can think about is killing myself,"My husband was arrested a couple of days ago for dv. He choked me and pushed me down. He had recently started slapping me in the face more and more. Anytime we’d argue he’d say “do I need to slap you around?”. He’d corner me to the wall put his nose against mine and scream at me. 

He had horrible anger problems. He recently suggested that he should probably go to the mental hospital. I suggested a place I went to as a teenager and I was going to call them after thanksgiving break. 

I feel like I failed him. I feel like I wasn’t a good wife. I feel like if I had helped him get mental help sooner none of this would have happened. 
I feel like he was my best friend he understood me. I feel lost. We have 2 babies and I don’t won’t to raise them alone. I don’t see how I can go on.",1

Catching the bus I guess.,"I'm 15m. I don't really wanna be here anymore, I was sexually harassed by a trusted family member when I was younger.

I don't know anything else to do, I promised myself that If I didn't find a reason to live in three years I was going to kill myself. That was two years ago on Christmas eve. I'm worried to do it but ya know, nothing really gets you ready for death.",1
I deserve it,"I don't know what else to do anymore. I am positive that no body wants me around anymore. All the people I know have some really heavy messed up stuff going on in their lives, and they all rely on me as a friend as much as I rely on them, but lately I haven't been such a good person. I just burden other people the longer I live be it academically, mentally, socially, or physically. Probably none of my friends noticed how many times I've attempted this week from the way I've been acting, they all think I've gotten happier in a weird way. The only friends I told about it have pretty much given up on me too, they've just accepted that I'm gonna die bc ""it's easier that way"". They expect a lot from me as a person even tho I've messed up so much, I'm pretty sure the rest of them hate me and are just waiting for me to leave already. Idk why I'm like this, I just can't get myself to do the things I know I should do. I run away when I see someone I know crying instead of comforting them like I used to and I just pretend like nothing happened, I don't apologize for my mistakes(at least not if no one tells me about them directly), I don't clean up after myself, I slack off in group projects, I make insensitive comments, I'm slow to sympathy, and I always find myself blaming someone else for my stupidity. No matter what I always hurt everyone around me. I promise that I don't wanna be a bad person, I just am. I'm unfixable at this point. Everyone at home just ignores me and let's me be the designated problem child of the family, they don't care if I drink, smoke, or drug myself to death in my room. They probably won't even notice I died till a couple days later. I genuinely hope when I finally die that they'll all be happier without me.",1

Coming clean about sexual assault before ending this,"In 2016, I sexually assaulted my friend and roommate. I was 19 so very much old enough to know what's right and what's wrong. No consequence ever came of it, though I'm sure I could have brought some upon myself if I had the courage to go to a police station (and even if they don't consider what I did SA, I could advertise it on social medias and keep everyone from interacting with me). I just stood there and allowed nothing to come of it. Her fucking dad apparently blamed her and told her she's to blame for deciding that we should sleep together in the same bed, when the truth is that things went wrong because **I** made them go wrong. I'm tired of being vague about what exactly happened everytime I go through it, I'm fucking sparing myself from the pain of talking about the real, physical and mental pain I inflicted on someone. I touched myself in the same bed she was sleeping in, my head resting on her legs.

I barely lost any friends, some of them I wanted to cut off ties with anyway, I lost nothing of value. I need to die. It's not even that I need to, it's that the world would be more right if I did die. I failed everything, I failed at the most basic of things and the truth is that at the end of the day, there is no coming back from that. There's no peace, there's no becoming a better person and moving on, there is just the unbearable pain of my victim that I can't undo.

My friends don't know who they are friends with. They have no idea. And whenever I tell one, they're being fucking idiot and come up with bullshit excuses for my behavior. The first therapist I saw, she almost said I should be proud that something only happened months after sleeping in the same bed it is such bullshit if I could die and take them with me I would, we're so vile. My fucking girlfriend was shocked for barely a few weeks and now it's like I never told her. I can't even fully blame them, I'm too ashamed to actually tell them exactly what happened sometimes, like once I made it seem like an older friend doing something similar to me when I was 11 somehow traumatized me and made me do it. I'll tell you the truth : I was looking to jerk off. That's all that was on my mind when I did it. I didn't think about what she was going through until I realized later that she was awake to experience it.

I won't make someone kill me like by jumping in front of a vehicle or something, I'm thinking of making it so I'd die in a closed room and then I'd leave notes that my corpse is in there and that professionals should be called to handle my body. The only way to make this matter is if I end my life. The very idea of me being happy is fundamentally unjust.",1

My girlfriend who has gotten me through everything is giving up on our relationship,"Hi. Thank you for reading this. I dont know what else to do or who else to talk to. I only have my girlfriend I've known since I was 13 (I'm 17 now) and long story short we've been drifting recently. She seems uninterested in me and like she's pushing me away. Me and my girlfriend are not the arguing type; we're very smart when it comes to giving eachother time. Yesterday night, she confessed to losing feelings for me then took it back about 10 minutes after, sitting down having a long talk with me. Telling me everything would be okay, we explained how we felt, discussed what we should do, etc. Today I left to go see my family, she hadn't talked to me this morning. She then brought all of my stuff to the house I was at. Clothes in a garbage bag.. the works. I asked her if we could talk, to which she said we could Monday. I asked her if everything was going to be okay because I needed to hear it from somebody, to which she replied ""I don't know."" I then asked if she would tell me if she's planning on separating. She didn't respond. This is hugely out of character for her. She always reassures me. She's a very honest person, she is the most honest person I know so her not responding to that shows she's uncertain or she does plan on this. I've been told by my family who are all married to just give her space and let time even stuff out.

Knowing she is uncertain on leaving me or not kills me, I'm freaking out. She has gotten me through my terrible adolescent years, through being separated from my family, through 2 suicide attempts and debilitating depression. She is my world. Lately, I've been extremely suicidal but I haven't told her as we've been distant for awhile and as to not worry and drain her. She's had a lot going on recently.

I know I should maybe post this on relationship advice and I probably will too but I really want to hear from people who are in the same state of mind as me right now because you guys understand.

It is taking a lot for me to not give in and do something terrible to myself.

If any of you have advice, words of positivity, personal stories, maybe even blunt truth if you have any, please share it.

I seriously seriously need it right now.",1
Everyone leaves me,"I'm 31. It's been going downhill for over 5 years. I don't want to keep on living. I tried my best but I'm still being discarded by people I love. I always give them love and I'm caring..but they leave me. I don't even like myself anymore because I feel so unlovable, I'm miserable and lonely, I isolate myself, then I click with someone and see a ray of hope, then they leave me and I'm even worse than I used to be.


I wish someone would kill me so it would seem like an accident and my family wouldn't be sad. I really want this to end, I want all of the suffering to end and committing suicide seems like the only option to finally find peace. It's the third time this year I seriously consider killing myself. I have a plan and all, I just kept postponing it. I can't take it anymore.",1

I've lost so many potential friends this month because of how overbearing and obsessive I can get since I have absolutely nobody so I get attached really fast.

what to do instead of killing yourself?,"everybody tells you not to kill yourself but nobody tells you what you're supposed to do instead. i take my meds, I go to therapy twice a week, I see my friends when I can. been to every ward in a 100 mile radius. i do everything in my power to improve my life and mindset because I truly do want happiness or at least neutrality but after years and years of improvement and actually seeing change, I've been stripped down to just the core of me and I've realized no matter what life I live, no matter what wishes get fulfilled, this is what I am like. i cannot be happy. i could win the lottery, I could reprogram my entire brain but the person I am is an unsatisfyable, unhappy one. any time spent continuing life will be promised unhappiness and I just don't know what I'm expected to do other than kill myself.",1
Why not?,"I'll try keep it short.

29M, total fuck up, failed in every aspect of life. Fail to find purpose in anything, can't find faith in God, relationships only last a few months (if that).

Back in August I was actually content with being alone but wasn't sure if it was the 'right' way to live. Asked God to give me a sign and shortly after a girl on Instagram replied to a comment I made, we end up talking and connecting deeply. She dumps her bf of 4 years after realising how dysfunctional it was, we fall for each other. I never wanted a long distance relationship but travel to her in Croatia from the UK. Things are good at first, then I see a difference in her eyes. Says she doesn't think a relationship with me is the right thing for her. I'm so confused and hurt because I genuinely love this girl and was finally content in life, picturing our future together. Now it's gone. She's left me as everyone else has. I can't figure out what I did wrong, other than exist. My existence is a failure.


Question: What is so wrong with quitting life? I'm always miserable and feel nothing. Love negates this for a time until I get my heartbroken inevitably again. I don't want to live if this is all there is. A cycle of pain, failure, pain, failure. I genuinely don't see the point. Why bother?

I feel nothing.

I planned on ending things years ago until my ex intervened and told my family. I won't tell anyone this time (other than internet strangers...). I'm just looking for one reason to continue to exist in this mess.",1
Asking for advice,"I am 15 years old, male. I tried to commit suicide September 20th of this year. I downed 30 something “strong” sleeping pills. I for some reason had thought this will do the trick, and I will go peacefully in my sleep. I was wrong, after scarfing down those pills I fell asleep in a matter of minutes. During those few minutes I was not asleep. I felt horrible, itching all over my body, feeling very drowsy and nauseous. I was content on ending it, nothing could change my mind. After I had fallen asleep I awoke around 5 and half hours later. Threw up, cried, and threw up more. I did not cry because I was regret-full, I cried because it did not work. After all was done and said I fell back asleep. When I woke up the next day I felt empty. Nothing felt real, I felt as if I was in a dream. The taste of chemicals and death still on my tongue and no matter how much water I drank it would not go away. 

It has now been a month since my attempt.
I have never felt so low and lonely in my life. No one knows about this, and I do not think I should tell my parents because they would most likely blow it out of proportion.
It’s getting to the point where I have no motivation to get out of bed, no motivation to eat, no motivation to do literally anything. I just want everything to go back to normal. I want to be a normal teenager, one who doesn’t have to go through all this bull shit. I’m scared I’m going to try again, but I’m also too scared to go and talk to anyone.",1
The suicide paradox,"People as sentient beings suffer,  and this is true for all people but for some the suffering, the pain, and the despair remain and an inability to find relief and happiness becomes impossible. This in turn drives people to consider suicide to end their suffering and despair but often in this moment when they've devised a way to end their suffering through taking their own life they feel lighter, there's a relief a lighter existence, How can it be that knowing your life will end can bring the happiness and peace you want and have strived for, it's kinda messed up when you think about it! I remember once being on mushrooms and thinking to myself my entire existence is me wanting for other people to be okay and for them not to feel the way I feel and to not cause them any pain, but then contemplating taking my own life (which made me feel better) until the realization it would essentially destroy the lives of my family and friends who would blame themselves and then I kind of had an argument inside my mind that went but these are the thoughts of a conscious person once your dead it won't matter but then another part of me went but your nature is to never be the cause of anyone else is pain and this is what you're going to do so much so that any joy you've brought them would be disproportionately outweighed by the grief you've caused them. Also why do I try and save everyone else who mentions suicide when for myself I believe that lifes a shit tip and humanity kind of sucks so I want out. Isn't it kind of peverse that I love other people and talk them into staying around when actually everything they tell me with why they want to go i agree with.  


Long story short   
I feel so unhappy

"I know it's not the right thing to do, but I sometimes just break down and cry and want to end it all!","I am 33M, single, India live alone with my 2 dogs. My parents live around 15 minutes away. All through my childhood, I saw them always fighting, so after my education, I left their house.

I have social anxiety and going out amongst people scares me- so going to people and asking for help seems unlikely and stressful.
I do okay financially, but my work is hardly an hour per day, and doesn't keep me busy.
Lately, I feel no one would miss me, if I die- except maybe my dogs. I exercise daily for 1 hour, and it makes me feel better for a while.

i just need help to end it im so desperate,"i cant feel my body i cant feel anything. my whole body hurts . i doont havr enough meds to try and od again. i just want to go out painlessly wverytging already hurts enough as it is. im back to cutting myself daily, that is wheenever im awake. i can barely stay awake . i dokt do anything when im awake. my days arent filled wiht anything i cant bring myself to do anything. when i do, it doeesn t work. nothing brings me joy. the only thing that does, the last thing im holding onto is slowly leaving me. going away like wverythig else in the paast, ghroughout my whole life .  i cant stay awake for more than a feew hours.  my whole body is numb and my head hurts, i can barely keep my eyes open. i cant stay focused on even being lucid. i have nothing no worth and no one. i need the last thing im holding onto to let me go. there s no peace for me or anyone else other then dying. staying alive isnt living its just prolonging my death. i need the last thing im desperately grasping onto to let me go. i can disappear and die knowing itll be better for them. i need a gun so desperately so i can die painlessly. 

i dont want anymlre pain. everyime i sleep i have horrible dreams and icant wake up. i have nightmare after nightmare an d inwake up terrified. my whole body is sore. everyrhing hurts psychically yet i can barely feel my body. it feels like im not walking in it. i cant walk in a straight line. theres is nothing there to make me feel better anymore. even if there is, they just leave. im so desperate for a gun. before i made sure to know wherre to cut, exacrly where major artwries and veins were on my throat and arm so i could aim for thosse. for a faster and less painful death. but it still hurts. i need a gun now. i know to make sure to aim right so i dont accidently survive. im so desperate. ive been reaching out to people who dont talk to me anymore. people i dont know. people i do know. no one can get me a gun. its so hard getting a gun in nyc. i dont want to go out and get shot, i want to shoot myself. i need a gun. i dont know if i need angyhing so badly more than this. i need it. 

ill only use it once i can let go to what im holding onto. otherwis e i just keep sufferring. i have aome things worth monetary value. need to selll them so i can at least leave something of worth for them.  it wont be much but its something. more than incan ever be of worth.  i need weed or alcohol so it at least feels like its not me suffering in my own body. i cant get my hands on any. when i ask peoplr i know they deny me. is having some sort of substance teally gonna be worse than needing a gun. it just feels like they leave me out more. it already hurts as it is. at least it wont have to be my own mind when im not sober. yet theyre aallowed to indulge and they leave me out. yet its not the only thing im left out of.

 i dont have anyone, no money no job no will to live, unable to sit up in my body for even a short amount of time, nothing of worth, no talent or skill, nothing interests me or brings me any sort of joy except for one thing that is slowly leaving me. im not smart in any capacity. ive tried before. ive tried really hard. and i always end up in the same place. 

i dont see any point. i cant do anything right. i need a gun. im so fucking desperate. i need to sell some of my things to make some money to leave. this isnt even all of it. theres so much more. incant think. my head hurts.

i jusf need a gun
ppleaas someoke

Burnt out and empty inside.,"I'm 18 years old and I'm simply done. I'm done with life, I'm done with others treating me like their disposable friend, I'm done with being a burden and disappointment to my family, and I'm done with being so exhausted from simply existing. My anxiety is taking over my life and I just can't keep living like this for the rest of my life. I'm overwhelmed with my assignments and finals week that is coming up. If I fail, I will lose my financial aid. After that I'm done. I will have failed my parents and myself. I don't have a clear plan for myself and I definitely do not matter to others. I've been a loser my whole life, worth nothing. No one's gonna care when I'm gone. ",1
done with being abused,"was severely abused by my parents my entire life witnessed a lot of DV suffered corporal punishment and emotional abuse. had 2 longterm boyfriends the first when i was 13~16 and th next 16 to 2 days ago, im 19. they abused me too, i lost friends due to both of them they tried to isolate me from family as well. cant stop thinking about killing myself. just took 800mg of gabapentin telling myself its to get high. thinking about drinking some vodka taking therest along with every otc in the bathroom. i feel complete apathy toward myself and my situation. i feel as if i have been tortured and dying will be the only escape. i have been told so many times that im ""not alone"" or to work through it all in therapy. it wouldnt matter id still have a fucked up brain nervous system and body, accepting i was hurt in everyway would not make my life worth living. i have had the thought ever since i was 13 if i had a gun id have no hesitation. it would be almost instantaneous and i wouldnt be able to take it back.",1
23M I wish I could die,"I am completely done with life I literally can’t take it anymore. I really want to die but I’m too much of a coward to do it myself I wish life would just put the final nail in the coffin and kill me.

It’s not like anyone would give a shit I’m completely alone in this world.",1
16m Dunno what to do anymore....,"I don't really know what to do anymore, I have so many issues that are wrong with me, I have species dysphoria, I'm scared of my parents, they don't help me at all, I have severe brain fog and havnt even been able to live my life, I really just need out of here.... or just going to end it all.....",1
What is the point If I’m so disgustingly ugly?,"I wanna die I don’t wanna be here im so sick of being alone. im hideous i will stay alone forever because of my ugly face 
I hate my feelings i hate my thoughts 
I hate being h0rny i hate being attracted to man because i just crave something that i could never get,
I feel like it’s embarrassing that i even breathe around attractive man existing around them is disgusting and embarrassing for me.
Everything i do is cringe 
It hurts so bad when i see couples everywhere i go and when attractive girls get any man they want,
I will never know what it feels like to be desired and be treated well by man 
I will never fall inlove i will never experience anything romantic 
I wanna cry when i see how other girls are loved and get treated like princess.
I have nothing to do here 
Life is black and white everything is pointless  i have nothing to live for 
Being trapped in a ugly body is hell 
Because humans are made for love and touch and being ugly depletes you from happiness 
I wish i could atleast stop being attracted to man maybe it would be a little less unbearable to live in this ugly body",1
I'm 14m and i'm not sure what to do," i don't really have any motivation or reason to live, but i also don't have reason to die either and getting help is a bit hard since my family's very poor so i'm asking if any of you have recommendations of ways to get a reason to live and i definitely have way more mental issues than this but i'm only going to talk about this one and we live out in the country and like i said before we're poor so don't recommend things like ""go sight seeing""",1
i want to die before my mom knows i really failed a class,"she knows i failed, she does not accept it, im in college. she wants to see my grades after my finals, and i know i failed calculus. 

im so tired of this, i want to die rather than her finding out that i failed, im scared of her, i wish i could leave home. i cant breath",1
"23M, I feel like the end is near","Hi everyone,
I am on the edge of ending it all. I have no contact to my parents. My mom has bpd and my dad is a narcissist. They have mentally abused me since I was a child. They split when I was seven. That same year we went from being well off financially to always having financial struggles as their company went bankrupt. I was traveling back & forth between my parents until I broke contact with them a couple of years ago. I felt like I never had a home up until that point. I met my gf before ending contact with my family and she is the most wonderful person in the world and the only reason why I haven’t done something yet. We live together. I don’t want to ruin her life by ending mine but the pain is unbearable atm and only growing day by day. I plan on committing by overdose of either fentanyl, coke or heroin. I haven’t bought my exit ticket yet but I’m afraid once I have the substance at home it will be only a matter of time. I don’t want to hurt the love of my life but I don’t/can’t stay alive either. I have huge financial issues even though I work my ass off. I have debt due to my parents giving me horrendous financial advice when I was 18/19ish and my dad stealing a lot of money from me. There’s literally no reason to stay alive other than the reason that I don’t want to ruin my girlfriends live.",1
"The only reason I don’t kill myself is because of my mom, but even saying that feels so narcissistic.","I don’t want to he here. My mom made me without my consent (obviously) and I’m done. I’ve told her multiple times I want to kill myself and each time she gets really upset, and says she doesn’t want me to. Ok fine, I try to stay for her but that just sounds prideful. I really just don’t understand why she would care. I really just don’t. Saying “I’m staying here for other people” sounds so narcissistic. 

My life offers nothing to anyone. I just sit here and unless I’m high I would rather just check out. Life sober is miserable and unbearable and every man on both of sides of my family has been an addict, and two on my dad’s side killed themselves.",1

I want to die,"(21f)
There’s no point to anything….I have no purpose. I have no reason to exist. Why am I alive if I am the way I am? What reason am I me if I’m pointless? All I do is cause problems and stress, and I end up pushing people away. People want me until they can’t use me anymore, so why am I alive if all I’m here for is other people’s selfish wants and desires? I hate myself and I hate my life and I just want to die…I hate life so so much. I’m so lonely. Why do I even exist? I hate humans, they’re so selfish and can never feel empathy and can never think about other people and have no ability to put themselves in other people’s shoes. Humans are born selfish and never change. I want to kill myself so bad but if I fail then off to the psych ward again, which is living hell and does way more harm then good. All they’ve taught me is to keep my suicidal thoughts to myself so I don’t have to go back, humans are unempathetic and instead of sitting down and talking the suicidal person through it and asking what’s wrong and what they can do to help and to support you, they just cart you off to the psych ward because that’s the easiest option and they don’t have to invest time and effort and emotion into it. So instead of genuine support people just push you off on someone else. Always. Because it’s convenient. Instead of treating you like a human being with your own thoughts and needs and wants and desires and self-esteem, instead of treating you like they’d want to be treated in your situation. Instead of community and emotional intimacy and understanding, they send you off to the mental health version of prison. F that, man. See if I ever say anything about my suicidal ideation to anyone in real life ever again. I had more than enough of that as a teen. I just want to feel okay again. Tonight is just another night of crying myself to sleep. And I’m so tired of it, and of life, and of humans, and of myself, and of existence in general. I’m so tired. I just want to be listened to and heard and understood and treated like every other human being wants to be treated. Life sucks so much. I feel so alone. Everybody only thinks of themselves. Nobody tries to understand what other people are going through anymore",1
has anyone else had the active thought of suicide on your mind EVERY DAY of your life that you can remember,"I've made a lot of throwaway accs with relatively poorly composed posts compared to what I would usually write to vent my problems through and I find that I think the details of my chronic childhood based problems bore everyone and/or scare and disturb them too much for anyone to connect but essentially I don't think a single day of my life has passed that I can remember when I didn't crave to die and/or wasn't seriously contemplating suicide.

I won't this year bc I've developed extremely ambitious and thoroughly planned goals out of spite and bitterness toward who I was in childhood and even though I'm fully convinced I will crash and burn bc I'm the most intrinsically wretched and ruined and disgusting girl who has ever lived and I make the world a worse place by living and the only thing I will ever have going for me is my body I won't exhausting the fight to be reborn as something real and good before I go out.

but even in the best and most elevated mental health state I've ever been able to experience in devoting myself to this I don't think I've ever once truly been an active listener in any conversation bc I literally can't think about anything at any time without voices monologuing in the background out of my control about death. I'm so tired but I never stop fighting because my plan that I've had since I was a preteen isn't supposed to happen for another few years.

I've always wondered...is this how everyone else on the planet is living and I was just a weak little girl to make so many gestures and seek so much attention constantly in vain??? did it just take me longer than everyone else to shape up??? or is this truly a curse...and does anyone else have it like this here

I am 17 btw if anyone is around my age and wants to be friends bc I have no real reliable connections in my life I'm a model and the only connections I ever make who are interested in how I'm feeling and supporting me in it are other creatives who are adult men who assume I'm dumb and inexperienced with their type and it won't come back to haunt them one day to creep on me. still Idk who else to fall on as it is. almost 18 and I think early to mid 20s is when I will choose to execute my plan bc I already feel old and used up and expired and if I could hardly tolerate living to turn 12 Idk how I'll survive my 20s",1
